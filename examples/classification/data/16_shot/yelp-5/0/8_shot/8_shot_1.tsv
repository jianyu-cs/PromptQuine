Circus circus is an accurate description of the type of people you will see here. It might have been nice 20 years ago but its a dump compared to any other hotel on the strip. There is plenty of things for kids to do and the steakhouse is superb. But if your net worth is over $5000 I wouldn't stay here.	0
"I don't know if this store is now closed or if their hours just aren't accurate, but I've been by twice in the past two weeks during the stated \""open\"" hours, only to find the door locked and no one inside. I tried calling several times, but I wasn't able to leave a message because the mailbox was full (and no one ever answered). Very frustrating and disappointing. I've heard good things about the selection and was very excited about shopping here for a vintage dress that I could wear to my wedding -- but after trying so many times, I've given up and gone somewhere else. :-("	0
"My girlfriends parents booked a room here recently via Expedia because it's close to us. Even though they were \""hotel\"" customers, the staff here tried to sell them on time share at checkin and were pretty condescending about it, asking about their income etc. They pointed to a sheet of paper saying, well if you make at least this amount, you can qualify, with the attitude that they clearly didn't. My girlfriends father pointed at the other end of their brackets and said \""I make this\"" to which they changed their tune. He then had the satisfaction of shutting them down. \n\nIf you agree to stay here knowing it's a time share, that's one thing. To book it as a hotel  and get the sales pitch and snub simultaneously is poor form.  Seems like shady advertising (and poor customer service) to me."	0
I'm staying at the Hard Rock and passed by Pink Taco while walking through to the pool. Since I have had nothing but great experiences at both the Sunset and Century City locations in LA, I assumed the same would go for Vegas. Wrong.\n\nFor just 2 people, it didn't take long for us to be seated as there weren't many people inside. Our waitress Melisa, however, was extremely rude and had a terrible attitude. She didn't come check on us one time, and passed us to walk through several times. When asked how big the burritos were, she just shrugged and acted like it's not her job to know the menu at the restaurant she works at. \n\nShe only was waiting on 2 other tables while we were there, and she couldn't even bring us out our food or refill our waters. \n\nAs for the food, I got the CHicken Tostada Salad and I have absolutely no complaints., thus the one star. My friend ordered the Burrito Mojado and the rice and beans that came with it were terrible. Runny beans and hard rice don't go well with anything. \n\nBesides the extremely terrible service, when she brought us the check, she charged us 3 bucks for sour cream, which came on my salad but I asked for it on the side. After waiting about 10 minutes and us asking to speak to her manager, she said we could just go up to the cashier and ask. \n\nThe cashier was apparently the host and greeter all in one, so it took a while for us to even notice we were there. She did end up taking off the charge after our explanation.\n\nI planned on complaining about the waitress but the manager was busy getting a complaint from someone else in the restaurant so I settled for leaving Melisa no tip :)\n\nLesson learned, I'll just stick to LA!	0
Keep on driving by.........\n\nI don't understand the high reviews.   I've been here twice just to check myself.\n\nBoth coffee and espresso have no taste.\n\nTo boot, wireless does not work well.  I had to use a neighboring business.\n\nMove on to the next place.......	0
Ate here last night with 11 friends - maybe the worst meal we've ever had. Food was cold. Almost broke a tooth on a French Fry. No table service. Place was dirty. Do you get the idea it was bad?\nSkip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist.	0
This place gets WAY too much hype.  Oily, unpressed food and service.  Will not return.  No grill marks on my burger.  No flavor.  WACK!\n\nMy service was horrible!  My server was preoccupied to perform required tasks such as taking my order and filling my glass.  I had to flag down other server/busboy to take care of these things.  My coffee cup sat empty most of the time there.\n\nSweet Potato Fries-standard; jalape\u00f1o mayo-no heat\nTruffle Parmesan Fries-not fried to my liking what i would consider a crisp fry.  a\u00efoli was weak and unimpressed.  at least real parm was used however it was not well distributed.  not impressed at all\n\nFarm Burger-unimpressed.  Duck breast bacon was gimmicky at best.  Nothing to report other than oily wet unimpressed burger.  Asked for med rare and pretty much got a rare burger.  Server took forever to come and check on us by the time she did my burger was almost eaten.  She was so bad that I did not want another burger.  \n\nChanterelle Burger-unimpressed; best part was the arugula and  figgy-onion jam\n\nBritannia Burge- unimpressed mango chutney + arugula\n\nget the pattern?  make overly oily and bad burgers and add toppings on them...\n\nBest part was leaving knowing that I would never come back.  Another celeb establishment blown up with super hype from the general public.  Joke	0

"The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening. The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price, too. I would pass on the Crab Roll. Salmon nigiri tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable.  The Karatumba sake was good, as well. \n\nSo why the two stars? Mostly it was based on service and the fact that Uni was not present (just like many other sushi restaurants in town). It took well over 5 minutes after being seated for the server to come around and introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was not a busy night.  \n\nThroughout the whole evening our server only took one empty dish back to the kitchen.  I am fully aware that in some restaurants there are \""servers\"" and there are \""bussers\"" but I think servers should communicate with their bussers if the servers are less inclined to bus their own tables.  I understand that some servers want their bussers to work for their tips if the servers are \""tipping them out.\""  We were left with empty plates at our dinner table for the whole evening.  Our server constantly asked us if we needed more to drink and we might have been more inclined to stay and order more drinks if our table had been bussed.   \n\nEarlier at throughout the dinner, when we asked for soy sauce she grabbed the soy sauce container from an unbussed table that was dripping sloppily with sauce on the outside of the container. Later, because she chose an easy solution, we quickly ran out of soy sauce and she actually had to go inside the kitchen and bring us a filled, clean container. Overall, the impression we received is that of a lazy server.\n\nWe most likely will not go to Stingray again unless it is for a quick bite of a Summertime Roll."	1
Not going to be long winded but here goes. Drive 6 hours to get here. Our server Chelsea was fantastic. Atmosphere was good. Lobster poutine.....barely any lobster or gravy or cheese and had to pull 2 lobster shells out oft mouth. Pretty much a bowl of fries. Seafood risotto......started off great until chewing on unshelled shrimp. Not at all appetizing since bill for table of 4 was over 300.00 . Will not be back	1
How do they get away with calling this place an all suites hotel?  Just because you slap a sofa in a hotel room does not make it a suite.  The room had the most akward layout ever.  You could not watch TV from the sofa or the beds comfortably.  The old school tube TV was suck in a cabinet and while it did pull out, it did not swivel.  Had to move it by hand, and pray it wouldn't fall over.  Each bed had three pillows, all different but all had a plastic cover below the case.  Move around; crunch, crunch, crunch.  So annoying.\n       My room was so dirty, I've stayed at Motel 6's that were cleaner.  The carpet was coming up, the wallpaper was peeling off.  I saw candy left on the floor near the bed.  In the bathroom someone had wipped bloody boogers on the wall.  The mini bar had dust so thick on it, it  look like it had never been touched.  The best part though was a half-eaten pickle wrapped in a napkin sitting in the fridge.  It was the only thing in there, how could you miss that?  The sundries also sucked.  Two bar soaps, one lotion and one shampoo, that's all.  So don't expect too much from this place.  I won't be back to stay.	1
"I was really looking forward to trying this place it had good reviews and wasn't too far from home.\nIt was a week day around 5 and it was pretty empty so we got a hibachi grill to ourselves. We put our orders in and not too long later we got some miso soup which was  different from most miso but I liked it. The salad was the typical salad with ginger dressing. The chef came out shortly after I think his name was Joshua. He did the normal shtick but was very dry, didn't  have much \""stage presence\"". We didn't get the choice of white or fried rice like you do at most other trepan restaurants. \nHe made us fried rice, it was really nothing special.  The rice seemed old. Doug got the steak done medium. And I got shrimp and chicken. The shrimp was okay, they don't cook it with the sauce which made it a bit bland, and my chicken, was way over cooked, very dry and had no taste. I don' t think he likes to use seasoning. We even hinted to him to add more butter but he didn't take the hint. The steak was cooked okay but again had no seasoning. It was bad. We were asked multiple times if everything was okay, I finally explained to the girl what I felt. She said \""oh sorry, I guess our reviews hyped us up too much\"". Really!?\nI wanted to try their sushi at some time but I don't know if I want to even spend my money there again."	1
When I walked in to Lucky Strike, I immediately noticed the bar to my left. It was  a very long bar with a ton of stools as well as a few tables. I almost liked the bar area more than the bowling area, because it was so roomy. The lanes, on the other hand, were pretty ridiculously crowded.\n\nFirst off, there weren't that many lanes. While there were also several pool tables in the building, the actual bowling area was pretty small, with only a dozen lanes. Each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes, but to get by everyone at your lane, you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls. It was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super-close to the people you're with.\n\nAlso, while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes, one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art. I much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing (which were not good, by the way-Jamiroquai, seriously?!). The whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip.\n\nThe crowd there, surprisingly, was mostly suits who probably came straight from work. I was surprised the place was as busy as it was. While our lane waitress was super-friendly, service was really slow, and someone in our party said it almost would have made more sense just to walk to the bar ourselves for drinks.\n\nPrices vary depending on times and days, but if you're going to bowl Friday and Saturday nights after 6 p.m., it'll cost a whopping $39.95 per lane per hour. That, to me, is ridiculous when so many other lanes have unlimited cosmic bowling (with good music and music videos) for only $20 a person. Don't go to Lucky Strike-try Scottsdale Lanes instead.	1
"Still old, still warn but they seem to have increased the airflow quite a bit so not as smokie...smoky?? At any rate that is a good change. They have some good shows here. seems to be a little of an older crowd on the floor but looks like they are trying to \""modern\"" up a bit. Auto collection is always a good reason to stop by (free tic at autocollections.com  hash house is still upstairs if you are in the mod for some twisted farm food. Also doing a bunch of work out back (roads are a mess) where they are building a giant skywheel thingie. Hopefully more improvements to come."	1
"One reviewer said it best, \""It's like Black Friday...EVERYDAY!\""\nThis place was a chaotic mess when I was there, but I have a feeling it's always in a state of chaos. That said, it's worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices. The shoes and purses where in the worst shape-- holes, pen marks, tears, etc. But the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from -- lots of designer choices too. I tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top. This would be a good place to take in chunks... dresses one day, shoes another."	1
"The fact that their coffee drink \""with cream\"" and their tea with milk are labeled as vegan make me wonder if they really know what vegan means or if their \""vegan\"" dishes also have ghee or some other dairy in them. \n\nMy main complaint is the service. When we asked our server what he recommended as far as vegan food, he replied that he didn't know because he hadn't eaten there in three months....and then he recommended a dish with cottage cheese in it.    In addition, he told us it's BYOB and that we could bring wine because they probably have a corkscrew. He saw one in the kitchen three months ago...uh ok. Later we were asked if we needed anything \""since you're the only two people here.\"" He was definitely trying, so that's something I guess. \n\nThe food was spicy, but pretty good overall. The servings are large (2-3 meals worth, for me).  My vegan dish was served with a yogurt sauce (not vegan). My husband had the fried cauliflower dish and liked it enough but doesn't have any desire to return. \n\nIt might be better to go to the lunch buffet so you can figure out what you like. There are minimal descriptions on the menu and the servers (since the first hadn't eaten there he called over a second server) were unable to answer questions such as \""what does this word mean?\"", \""is this deep fried?\"", \""is this spicy?\"", etc.\n\nWe might give it another chance and try the lunch buffet, since it's so close to our place. Probably not though."	1
Decent burger but underwhelming chili. The chili should be the star of their signature burger, and it was more like an afterthought. The burger was OK, but  I wouldn't rush back. \n\nThere is no easy access to the restaurant from St. Rose, which is a deterrent.  I had to drive through the hospital parking lot to get here. Doh!\nThe yellow peppers were very good, they added a lot of flavor to the burger.	2
"Every now and then I get a hankering for Chinese food for lunch, and order takeout from here. I used to have to call, but now you can order (and pay) through their website.  However, after having order via the website today (with pick up time selected as \""ASAP\""), I will call in the future.\n\nI ordered pork with garlic sauce, white rice and egg drop soup.  Normally when I order takeout (via telephone), it is ready by the time I get there to pick it up (just a few minute walk from my office).  Today, however, I arrived to pick it up. And waited.  After the cashier asked my name/order, I saw him furiously scribble something down on an order pad then walk back to \""check\"" on my order. I don't think they checked their web order, and my order had been sitting there without going back to the kitchen.\n\n25 minutes after the timestamp on my order confirmation email, the food was ready.  \nThat's an enternity for Chinese take-out.\n\nThe food is good, fresh and a nice portion size. But I ordered take out because I didn't want to wait and sit down somewhere"	2
"I have been wanting to try New York Flavor ever since I moved to Surprise. Unfortunately, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. \n\nThe service is pretty good. Since it was my first time, I asked the woman at the counter if there were any \""favorites\"". She was very helpful in explaining the menu items. \n\nI ended up ordering the Spanish Harlem with a side of potato salad. First, let's talk about the potato salad. It came in a TINY little cup. I am talking, like two bites of potato salad. I wish I had saved the little cup to take a picture. I almost felt like I was being pranked. I paid $1.99 for this potato salad. I expected to be able to eat more than two bites of it. And, to be honest, the two bites of potato salad I had weren't the greatest. It tasted like potato salad you could buy at the grocery store; nothing to write home about.\n\nThe sandwich itself was pretty good. The spread was flavorful and the steak was cooked perfectly. The bread was just okay. The sandwich was $8.99, which felt a little pricey to me based on the size of the sandwich.\n\nAll in all, the service is there, but the food here just isn't something I would expect to receive if I were actually in New York, which is the impression I got from the reviews and the restaurant itself."	2
Eight or nine years ago on a visit to Montreal, I discovered Chu Chai (then in its former location) by accident while wandering the neighborhoods.  I was so thrilled to find an all veg restaurant serving fabulous food I dragged my traveling companion to meals there four or five times on our visit.\n\nLast summer I returned to Montreal -- a little bit older, a little bit wiser, different traveling buddy -- and made a point of heading back to Chu Chai.  \n\nThe restaurant had moved a lot farther up Rue St. Denis and is now more remote.  Boo.  The restaurant is now much smaller and the decor not nearly as subdued or appealing.  Boo.  Looking over the menu, I didn't see the one dish I had obsessed over on my former visit: vegetarian shrimp with crispy basil and sticky rice.  Booooooo.  Oh. Em. Gee.  That shrimp was mouth watering, the basil deep fried into addictive crispy chips and dusted with sugar, and the sweet-ish sticky rice was super sticky and chewy and served in a banana leaf.  No longer on the menu.  Ordered a chicken and mixed veggies, husband ordered spicy beef.  They were good, but they didn't come close to the former quality of the food.  Totally disappointed.  Prices were rather steep, too, even at lunch.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way on my next trip to Montreal to dine at Chu Chai, unfortunately.	2
Last year I scored one of those cool Groupon deals for three unlimited months of practice at the Bikram Yoga Pittsburgh studio. It was a great deal and I really enjoyed the classes.\n\nFirst off, I think that practicing in a hot room during the cold winter months in Pittsburgh is a great way to spend your time and money. It was refreshing and throughout the season I felt like I had a really nice buffer against my usual cold hands and feet. Bikram might not be for everyone; the room is really hot and it can be overwhelming to some. My husband had a hard time pushing through and doing the movements because it was so hot for him. I on the other hand really liked it, so it might depend on chemistry. It is worth a shot if you are interested through. I will be going in this week to get my winter fix. If you are on the fence about it, check their website and get on the mailing list. BYPGH runs specials regularly and you can usually find a deal to take some classes at a discounted rate, especially if you are new.\n\nI attended classes regularly between December and February and the studio got quite full at times (particularly over the holiday when people return to Pittsburgh to visit family). My work schedule was varying at the time, and I got to try classes on all days and times offered. I'm not sure if it still is, but the studio was carpeted at the time, which to Serena R's point seems strange because there is a lot of sweating going on. I enjoyed the teaching (particularly, I liked Zeb's classes) and even when classes were big the instructors still made point to compliment and constructively correct students, which is the point of attending a class so you can get better.\n\nSome other things that are good to know:\n+DRINK A LOT OF WATER before you even arrive. 90 minutes in a seriously hot room means you are going to sweat. You don't take drink breaks during the class because the point is to focus yourself through a series of 26 positions. Drink a lot before and bring a canteen for after.\n+Bring a yoga mat and a towel big enough to cover the whole mat (or close to it).\n+There's a men's and a women's dressing space with bathrooms, a shower, and cubbies to put your belongings during class.\n+The studio sells some drinks, like water and coconut water.\n+The studio rents mats and towels if you forget yours.\n+Dress: a lot men seems to wear swimming-like trunk shorts, running shorts, or speedo-like briefs. Shirts optional but formfitting usually. Women wear sports bra-like tops, running shorts (spandex or standard), formfitting tank tops, etc. Generally, not much that will hang loose or anything heavy enough to make you feel too hot.\n+Parking: can be tough depending on the time of day (night is easiest for parking). I think they suggest arriving at least 10 minutes early for class but I would leave at least 15 minutes extra for parking and walking to the studio.	2
"Being that I'm from Chicago, I do have high expectations for a \""Chicago dog\"".  It is by comparison a good \""Chicago dog\"", however does not seem to have as much flavor as one from Chicago.  I don't know if this is due to the type of hot dogs used (I know at least most if not all the ones I've eaten in Chicago were kosher) or something else.  But they aren't bad.  The breaded mushrooms are good, although they are definitely greasy.  The French fries are also good (especially with the cheese!).  We did a takeout order and everything was wrapped in foil to help stay hot, and it made it back to our office (a couple blocks away) with no problem.  I would visit again, but stand by my current 3-star rating of the food."	2
I really like this place. Food has been great & fresh every time I've gone in. Not the fastest service but very friendly. My only slight disappointment is the fresh juice they offer, I've had a few different ones now. Pretty much, they all taste the same, very tart/sour. REALLY hope they improve that! It's nice to have a healthy option near my home now. :)	2
How do I review this location without sounding bias? I absolutely loved the location on Tropicana and Hualapai when I lived in Summerlin. It was so clean...I mean CLEAN! Oh how I loved that location!\n\nTo compare this location with that one would be unfair, because there is ABSOLUTELY no comparison!\n\nThis store just totally misses the mark for me. It has the great prices that you'd expect from a Smitty's, but it's just not clean and inviting. Every time I come here, I just want to get in and get out. My Summerlin location I could stay in for hours and never want to leave! \n\nAt the end of the day, it serves its purpose being so close to home. But if I can, I'll shop the one on Green Valley Parkway and the 215 more often. That one is the closest to my old Summerlin location that I've found in this area.	2
I like Rubio's and this one is fairly close to home - so I go here often. Tonight I decided to have the Grande Bowl with Blackened Mahi (and no rice). Honestly, this was probably the best thing I've ever had at Rubio's! It was just excellent. The staff was efficient too - a great fast-food experience.	3
Great place for Brunch!	3
Was there on Saturday night with some friends. Excellent Go Go Rice, delish sushi. Just wish they had black napkins for those of us who wear black. We looked like lint catchers when we got up to leave.	3
"My sweetheart was working, so I found myself alone on a Saturday.  Woohoo!  After laying around the townhouse most of the morning, I decided to take a drive to get something to eat and shop at Costco in Tempe.  For a year or so I've wanted to try out Niro's Gyros at the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a stand-alone building that must have been built and then abandoned by Pizza Hut.  No matter, once inside it is clean, with brightly colored tables and chairs. The front counter is gleaming white tile.  \n\nI ordered a double gyro plate, which includes \""two toasted pitas served with a mountain of gyro meat with gyro sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries on the side.\"" After adding a large soda and hand over $12.71, I only had to wait five minutes for my number to be called.  \n\nThis is a casual eating establishment (i.e. plastic forks), so the gyro meat comes packaged within a white styrofoam container wrapped separate in white paper with the hot pitas and fries on the side.  There is enough meat to  overfill both pitas.  I found the whole meal very tasty and enjoyable."	3
In the fast food world of college campus towns, every place should have a traditional place that stands the test of time. That's Papa Del's. Quality pizza & sandwiches with great flavor, huge portions & reasonable prices keep you coming back. Service is slow and the building's architect should have been fired @ the first drawings review, but it's all about the food here & it is good.	3
It's a fact I give a lot of 4 stars...\nThe food is good and creative, they have good pizza and wonderful specials.\nThe service has always been great and the lunch is really good.  I take out of town guests here, visiting relatives and one time a wayward monk and all have been pleased.  OK I jest about the monk.\nTry it, have a special, enjoy some wine - don't go to a chain restaurant....	3
I've only been in the Stone House during restaurant week. However, I was very impressed. The restaurant has a great homey atmosphere. They give fresh muffins instead of bread, that were even warm when we got them. Plus, our waitress was nice enough to wrap up the ones we didn't eat. My food was delicious and filling. Definitely will be back.	3
"Every time I go to Arcadia Farms, I like to engage in a little fantasy (totally G rated)...\n\n...I'm a lady who lunches, knows nothing about the challenges of the daily workplace grind, and has the time to sip mimosas for 3 hours each afternoon (the mimosa element is really part of a broader alcohol fantasy that I should get checked out)...also, you should know that I'm always wearing a gigantic, Kentucky-derby style hat in this scenario. \n\nWhile the fantasy isn't likely to be my reality anytime soon, I love Arcadia Farms for having created a cozy and charming atmosphere that inspires just this sort of harmless day dreaming. The restaurant itself if small, which adds to the French country/shabby chic feel. The patio is beautiful and has a quaint garden feel. When you're there you'll immediately notice that the \""ladies who lunch\"" fantasy is actually a reality for many of the patrons.\n\nThe food is lovely, which is exactly how food should be at this type of place. One of my favorites is the pesto shrimp salad, and the warm vegetable salad is a close second. If you're in the mood to splurge, order one of the mini cakes - you'll be glad you did. Arcadia Farms is as famous for fabulous pastries as it is for salads, sandwiches and tea. \n\nWhen you're next at the Phoenix Art Museum, keep in mind that Arcadia Farms has another location there, though it is somewhat different. Similarly delish menu, but the atmosphere is much more streamlined and modern to fit the feel of the museum. While I love the original location the most, the museum location is a great treat when you're downtown."	3
This Wendy's is the best one in the area. Normally I don't eat at Wendy's but this place is right next to my work and is so convenient. But there are plenty of food places bear here so if it wasn't good, I really don't HAVE to go there. I go because the food is always great, their salads are fresh the chicken is cooked perfectly. The workers are wonderful. Tammy is amazing and helpful. I definitely recommend this Wendy's if you're looking for something quick and yummy.	4
Had a craving for some authentic Chinese food while visiting.  Food Express Chinese is an unexpected gem not too far of a drive from the Vegas strip.  Great classics dishes and some with a twist.  Their staff is friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.	4
"Scottsdale Fine Jewelers helped my fiance make me the happiest girl in all the world! Scott picked out (all on his own) and purchased my engagement setting from here and since the blissful day that he got down on one knee and asked me to be his wife, I have since made Scottsdale Fine Jewelers my go-to jewelery shop! We are in the process of purchasing our wedding bands from here too. \n\nI absolutely love the locally-owned feel of this jeweler. Typically it takes at least a week or more to get a ring re-sized, but here they can do it within hours! This means I don't have to part with my dear ring! The owner, his wife and their staff are incredibly friendly and very helpful with everything. I am searching for earrings to wear with my wedding dress and they have a great selection. If I'm lucky, my wallet might permit me to purchase a pair from here! Speaking of pricing, they have some extremely reasonably priced jeweler as well as very high-end jewelery. No matter the budget, chances are they have something. During my visits, I browsed the display cases and noticed a nice selection of engagement rings, bands and regular jewelery. They also can make anything you need because they have an in-house jeweler! I am so happy my fiance chose Scottsdale Fine Jewelers to purchase my ring because now they have a new customer in me too! I also thank them for treating an engagement ring like \""an emergency situation\"" because they sized my engagement ring and got the diamond placed in the setting within a couple days and just in time for the weekend so that my fiance could propose!\n\nAfter the proposal, I got to know Scottsdale Fine Jewelers very well! We both first stopped in to say thank you and to get my ring sized (I gave my fiance the wrong ring size!) They were very nice and friendly with everything! \n\nWe knew right away that we wanted to use them for our wedding bands, so in January, we stopped by to begin the search. My fiance's band was easy to find because he just wanted a classic platinum band. However, mine was not so easy! My ring is very unique and because of that, the band had to be made to match the ring. The jewelers said that he could get it made through the designer out of NYC who made my engagement ring, but they also offered to create it in-house with their jeweler to cut the cost. We decided to go in-house and wow, their in-house jeweler is certainly talented! I visited Scottsdale Fine Jewelers several times over the next four months and each time it was so enjoyable to stop in and talk to everyone there. I never did get to meet the talented jewelery maker, but her works says it all. The ring matched perfectly to my engagement ring and it looks beautiful! They worked with my schedule and got it to me in time. \n\nWe loved this jewelery shop so much that my parents ended up surprising me with a pair of earrings to wear on the wedding day and bought my sister the matching ring to wear as my Maid of Honor! Needless to say, Scottsdale Fine Jewelers is now our go-to jeweler and I thank them for making the wedding ring experience so delightful!"	4
"After moving to downtown Phoenix (and loving having done so) I grew tired of traveling 45 minutes each way to visit my stylist of 10+ years. A stylist I loved and admired. The decision to find a new stylist was traumatic, to say the least. After all, NOTHING is more important than good hair. It does not matter how much your shoes, clothes and car cost if your hair \""ain't right\"". \n\nAfter coming to terms with the decision to search for a new stylist/salon (thank you yoga, meditation and herbal cleansers) I decided to give Trini Salon a try. The salon is just around the corner from my home and a short walk or a quick  two minute drive when I'm in the mood to pollute the world. \n\nI was able to get an appointment with Trini himself (the man is busy!) relatively easy. When I arrived I was greeted by friendly and may I add, very attractive staff.  Once I met Trini I decided to let go of my inhibitions and simply asked for Trini's ideas on which direction my hair should take. Trini was straight forward and made suggestions about my hair I'd not tried before.  His choice of words and explanation made me think \""this man knows what he's doing\"" so I said \""go for it\"" and he did. It was like a scene from Edward Scissorhands. He moved fast, with authority and no hesitation. A master at work. And the result?  Perfection!  I've been back every three weeks since that first time and I'll continue to go until he retires or I lose my hair. And now that my \""do\"" is oh so right, I can spend a little less on shoes because I'm pretty sure no one is looking down at them anyway. \n\nI highly recommend this salon and from what I've learned, he's trained and is training every stylist to deliver the same level of service and precision. A win win scenario if you ask me...did you ask me?"	4
Great bar. Not too many people on Sunday or Monday night for football. Yummy food. (Their boneless wings and BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger are to die for!) The bartender was really friendly and made fantastic drinks.	4
I used to hate going to the dentist but now that I have been here twice I wish I would have found Dr. Nelson earlier! There is no waiting, everyone is friendly, and very fast. Caitlyn my hygienist was awesome. Also Rhonda at the front desk is extremely helpful with billing insurance. I have never actually had anyone sit down and explain every single aspect of the billing before! The office is super clean and they even offer nice headphones you can put on while working on your teeth.	4
This is my favorite nail place in Charlotte. \n\nEveryone was so friendly and made me feel so comfortable and everything felt so super clean. I especially liked that the lady made sure to tell me the price before I picked colors or anything- just since it was my first time there. \n\nI am 7.5 months pregnant and these ladies made me feel like a queen. I especially loved chatting with the lady (wish I knew her name) who has a 7 month old baby at home and getting all kinds of tips about the hospital and whatnot that no one ever seems to think to tell a new mom. \n\nI love that the basic service here included a parafin dip and that they will do both your nails and toes at the same time, so you can just sit back and truly feel pampered. \n\nIt has been almost a week since I have been and my feet are still feeling super soft and even the hubs commented on how much better they were after this place than any other one that I have been to recently. \n\nI am hoping to see these ladies at least one more time before this little baby girl gets here to make sure that my nails are in tip top shape for her arrival.	4
I love this place! The best dim sum in Chandler. My service was exceptional, I even went on lunchtime on a Friday with my boyfriend. It was priced fairly good, we both gorged ourselves on less than $30.00. Not too sure about the pink tablecloths or the giant lobster tank, but overall it was delicious :)	4

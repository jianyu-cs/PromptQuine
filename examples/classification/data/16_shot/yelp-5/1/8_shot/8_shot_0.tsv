Beware Sonora Quest billing department! I do not use this word lightly, but I can safely say that I HATE Sonora Quest. I tried to use their online system to pay a bill for myself and one for my child. Their system somehow ran the charge though FIFTEEN times, maxing out our HSA card, and still not paying the bill. After countless phone conversations with them and our HSA card company, it was determined that our HSA company should send them a check, which they did. I called back to ensure that they received the check, and they told me they did. That was in December. Then yesterday (this is now May) I got a notice from a Debt Collection company for $3.53. I called Sonora Quest, and after digging through our account, turns out they failed to apply the $3.53 to my son's bill because my HSA company did not put two Accession numbers on the check! They refunded our card $3.53, then according to them sent us SIX notices for that amount, but we haven't received even one thing (I flat out called them liars), and sent it to Collections. The woman on the phone tried to blame me for not getting my HSA company to put two accession numbers on the check, blame the HSA company for not putting two accession numbers, ludicrous!!! I stayed on the phone until I got her to accept accountability and apologize. A good company recognizes when they make a mistake, accepts accountability and apologizes. They don't try to blame everyone else. Ultimately she admitted that their billing department should have cross referenced our accounts to see if the $3.53 was part of our charges. Ya think??????	0
Wow with so many people working here you would think that it would be easy to get service. But think again!\n\nI recently went in to purchase a small but $100 item, and obviously me looking young and asking for help on a small dollar item (small compared to the over priced furniture) didn't warrant any attention. \n\nI asked for help and one salesman said he would find someone to help me, so I take it they are limited to what items they can sell or get commission on. After he said this I watched him not tell a sole that I needed help and then never came back. So next another salesman in front of me started talking with another salesmen's client about gambling, and when I said excuse me (when he stopped chatting) he made eye contact, then walked away...again probably not his dept., but wow not even acknowledge me.  \n\nLastly there were 3 salesmen in the dept I needed help with, they were with clients, all within 10 feet of me, and not one of them said they eventually would help me, or even make eye contact.\n\nSo I left after 20 minutes, I do not believe in having to fight to give anyone business.	0
"Super bad service!!!!! We got 7, when me and my friend come in, they ask us to sit down first. I told them rest of my friend will arrived in 20 minutes. They said it's totally fine and ask us to sit down and wait. However, after 5 minutes, when there was more customers came in, they ask us to leave our table and let other customers to sit down first (in a really bass manner)! I said I had informed you that my friend would arrived in 15 minutes. How come they ask customers to get up and leave the table once they assign for the table already! Main point is we have order some appetizer but not just sitting there and holding their table!!! So does it mean that they just want to kick us out!? If they want to earn lots of \""money\"" they should just change their restaurant to fast food restaurant not providing service! SUPER SUPER SUPER BAD SERVICE! NOT COMING BACK AGAIN!"	0
Went in for a haircut. Nice place. Multiple barber chairs. 1 barber. He seemed irritate that I showed up at 2pm on a Monday. Told me I MUST have an appointment to be seen, which wouldn't be for several hours.  I won't be visiting that place again.	0
I just received my third HTC phone from Verizon.  The first one (new, supposedly) quit in about two weeks, the second one lasted about 4 months and wasn't even programmed to talk to cell towers., I had to do myself while a rep walked me through this very technical procedure. As for third phone, I called a rep and they directed me to a store, so I went to this store.  The sales rep, an older man, was very patronizing, and said he would order replacement which I would receive the next day. That did not happen and when I called Verizon, I found that he had never placed the order. The order was placed with the Verizon phone rep and did get today.  I pleaded with them to be able to change to a different brand, but was told that couldn't happen. The store manager was very rude when I tried to explain re the phone not being ordered and his attitude made me realize just how little individual customers mean to Corporate America.  Anyway, here I am on my third phone in six months.  Wonder how long this one will last?	0
"Basically the negatives from other reviews is true. Customer service is pretty bad. The menu is not complete and there are no photos, so it's difficult to order if you're unfamiliar with Japanese food. Yes, I had to walk all over and look at the other items posted on the wall with photos--felt like I was intruding on other patrons at their tables but.....\nYou could say that the price is pretty cheap. Maybe I didn't know how or what to order, but the food was no big deal. The honey toast dessert is no big deal either. Yes, there are young waitresses there, like the other reviewer mentioned. If you've got \""yellow fever\"" you'll probably like the waitresses and their poor customer service skills."	0
"This review is only for the Coronado Caf\u00e9 in the South Point Hotel which offers around-the -clock dining. For some time the restaurant has been promoting its $12.95 prime rib dinner as a \""House Special\"".\n\nThis was hands down the WORST prime rib I have ever had. We came here on the recommendation of Anthony Curtis' Las Vegas Advisor website where it was described as a \""the big slab prime rib\"". That was hardly a fitting description. The slice of prime rib I received was cut in a wedge shape. The wide edge was about  1/2\"" thick and the opposite edge tapered down to zero. Nearly half of that was fat and gristle. What remained was simply flavorless. It came with a baked potato which was served lukewarm. The salad and rolls were okay but rather ordinary. Service was slow and we waited a very long time just to get menus before we could even order."	0
My husband made an appointment for me with Jason in service to have one wheel bearing changed. When he made the appointment in person, Jason told him the diagnostics would be $120 and that would be applied to repairs. When I took my car in a few days later, Jason told me it would be $180 for diagnostics. I was unaware of what Jason had told my husband, so I said ok.\n\nWhen they called me to confirm that the only thing that I needed done was 1 new wheel bearing, I was told it would be $810. Now, I might not know much about cars, but it sounded high to me! I put my husband on the phone and suddenly my bill was $540?! \n\nYou cannot trust these guys at all! Just because I am a woman they just thought they could lie to me and I bet they were laughing behind my back and thought they would jack me over! Even the $540 was very questionable and Jason initially tried to tell my husband that labor would be 4.5 hours!	0
"5 stars for the food \n0 for the service!!!!  (and if there was anything below 0, that would be it!) \n\nI saw the famous Scarpetta spaghetti on Food Network's \""The Best Thing I Ever Ate\"" and since that episode, I have been obsessed with going to Scarpetta. So excited that one opened up in Beverly Hills last October! However, I've been too busy to make the drive out there. \n\nI was in Vegas for 1 night on April 1st and while wandering around The Cosmpolitan Hotel, saw Scarpetta! Super excited! Made reservations for 8PM. Arrived on time and was seated promptly. Then waited, waited and waited! Really, 10 minutes before our waitress even came by our table (and empty seats all around us at this time)! Mind you, we had a 10PM show so I kept looking at the time... She took our drink order then returned 15 minutes later with our drinks!!! So almost 8:30 and have not even placed our order. She says she'll be \""right back\"" and another 10 minutes.... Ahh, if it weren't for that spaghetti, we would have walked out! So 35 minutes after we arrived, she takes our order. \n\nSpaghetti for me and braised short ribs of beef for my husband. OMG.. our food arrived at out table at 9:30! Ate fast (because we had tickets to a show at 10). BTW, the food was amazing!!!! \n\nHad to ask another waiter to find our waitress so we can get the check. She came back to our table at 9:50 (without the check of course) and I explained again we had a 10PM show (which we ended up being late for) and needed to get out of there! \n\nSo the food was as good as I thought it woud be but the service (or lack of) ruined my first Scarpetta experience :("	1
Fantastic beer selection and decent food. The BBQ pulled pork is always a favorite. Two thumbs up for the catfish sandwich and the 1/2 lb. burger, but don't order the chicken chili - gross! The good food made up for the terrible service. Our waiter was stressed out because they were understaffed during the rush before the Men's basketball game. I kinda felt bad for his situation, but he was very unprofessional and just plain rude. We love the roof-top terrace in the summer, so we might be back in when it's warmer.	1
The Skinny: the switch to new management has really hurt this place, that includes the rather poor details in the food (2) service: I'm not sure what was worse, our absent-minded waiter or the rather brusque attitude of the waitress (1) this place really went off the deep end on service and food within a year (2).\n\nIt may be a surprise but shabu shabu and sukiyaki isn't rocket science. But the lack of attention to essential details makes this place on my no-go list.\n\nEnticed by a Groupon Now! deal, the hubs and I headed to Swish for dinner. When we stepped in, we put in a drink order. And waited. And waited. Essentially we entered into the building at 8:05 and didn't get to put in our order until close to 8:30pm and that's only because we flagged him down.\n\nI guess that is the running motif around Swish. If you want to get service, you not only have to signal for service but you have to ask for everything. When I mean everything, I mean things like plates.\n\nBut how could the food be possibly bad here, you may ask? Isn't it just veggies and raw meat that you cook in a pot yourself?\n\nEven though the food is simple enough, it can be disasterous if not prepared appropriately. Take for example my order of Chicken Fiesta ($12.95 healthy portion) sukiyaki style which came with one small plate of vegetables, and a bowl of rice. \n\nThe chicken, was carelessly cut into various shapes and sizes - some as large as a 1 inch x 0.5 inch x 1 inch cube. The uneven size makes the cooking time highly variable and uneven. Plus trying to cook really thick pieces of chicken in a little iron skillet with minimal liquid takes forever. Added to the fact you don't want to cross contaminate the raw chicken with the other food, it ended up taking a long time before I could eat.\n\nThe haphazard plate of vegetables were also cut unevenly (some were really large pieces of napa cabbage and carrots which were hard to eat) which also exacerbated the above stated issues. The vegetables itself were okay, but I was a little irritated by the fact they put less than 15 leaves of spinach on a plate to make it look full. (For those in the know, that amount of spinach cooks down to less than a mouthful.) It's a total turn off because they charge another $3.95 for a miniscule plate of poorly cut vegetables.\n\nMy hubby ordered the hungry sized Kobe Chuck ($20.95) portion. Although his meat cooked better than my stuff because it was thinly sliced, the accompanying dipping sauces were horrible. The sesame sauce was musty, weird, and watery. Tasting like swamp water and looking like the crappacino they serve on Fear Factor, it was a horrific combination. The ponzu was okay but nothing you can't get out of a bottle from the supermarket.\n\nTo cap off this experience, the servers at the restaurant were poor. Our waiter, who was nice, appeared to be very absent-minded. He'd frequently forget to start the cooking pots, plates for food, cooking utensils, etc. Running the cheque took way longer than it ought to. The waitress on the other hand was more on the ball but had a poorer attitude towards the patrons (ie, sounding exasperated because someone didn't know what the meat choices were, grilling me on why I wanted a second set of chopsticks - because it handled raw chicken and we had no cooking utensils... that's why!... to name a few examples.)\n\nOne might argue the joint was busy. However I'd like to say something about that. I normally don't make comparisons but I just have to in this case. Shabu Shabu Paradise (Henderson) not only has one waiter in the whole joint but she handles the same number of customers all on her own. And, the service is way better than what we received here. Plus she has to deal with refilling unlimited plates of correctly cut vegetables, bowls of salad, condiments and rice.\n\nAlthough the food was edible, the service and the improperly prepared dishes really ruined this place for me. Plus, the rather lackluster portion sizes given the price of the meal is also a big turn off. \n\nEven though our other favourite shabu/sukiyaki place is 30 minutes away, I'd rather go there than suffer through another round of Swish.

"Uhhh, I think my neighbor is on crack.  He said, \""Julio G's is the best!...blah blah blah...the food is so good...blah blah blah\""  When he should have said, \""Dude, stay the hell away from Julio G's, their steak effing tastes like cardboard.\""\n\nI'd give it 1 star, but I reserve that for restaurants that have exceptionally bad service as well as food. J.G's had decent service, awful food.\n\nI can't think of a single good reason to go to Julios G's."	1
this place has gone down hill. came here for a friend's birthday. was ridiculously tired so we just wanted to kick back. nope. didn't happen. first room, stains all over the sheets and pillows. uh gross. called and they transferred us to another room. we found long strands of hair on the bed as well as more stains. called again and they transferred us again. by this time, we were tired, annoyed and extremely groggy. we get to our 3rd room but the cleaners are still cleaning so we sat outside the door waiting patiently. one of my friends befriended the cleaner and she told us that management had cut several people so theres only a limited # of cleaners per 2 floors. um ok. we get to our finally clean room and my friend comes out of the bathroom screaming. guess what? the toilet flooded. did she drop a deuce? no. the toilet was just weak which caused the flooding of not only our bathroom but our room too. had to move yet again. all within 2 hours. eventually, we called & complained and they comped us one night. i would've given TI 1 star but they have free wifi and that's a definite winner.	1
SunUp makes some decent brews, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. Here's what we had:\n\nAhi Sliders: Bland coleslaw and tuna were overpowered by the oversized and mediocre bun.\n\nShrimp tacos: Way too salty and overcooked. Fortunately, there were only two shrimp per taco, so the disappointment at how they tasted was mitigating by the sheer lack of content.\n\nMacaroni & Cheese: Not bad, but it's mac & cheese.\n\nThe service was great and there's plenty of space, but there's really no reason to eat here, and, in my opinion, there are better places to get beer.	1
Its ok when your drunk.. Other than that its nothing special	1
I came here for lunch with my fiance. \nWe left a bit disappointed. I ordered the greek salad with grilled chicken and my fiance had the Ruben. \nThe salad was good but it was just your average salad noting special, greek salads are suppose to have olives, theres did not have any, the chicken was premade.  My biggest gripe with this place is the price 12 dollars for a salad is fine but it was very small for the price. \nAfter tip we had spent over 30 dollars for lunch for a sandwich and a salad w/ a root beer and a diet coke \nover priced for OK food	1
Stopped here for dinner with the family.\n\nAtmosphere:  this is the best thing about the restaurant.  There are both outdoor and indoor seating areas available.  We went indoors since it was pretty chilly outside.  There's a large variety of seating for different sized groups.  The interior is done in a wonderful Spanish style, utilizing the colors and patterns one would expect.  It was definitely a comfortable atmosphere.\n\nStaff:  we had no issues with service here.  Of course, the place was practically dead on a Sunday night, so I didn't expect any problems.  They were polite and attentive and ensured we received the correct orders.\n\nFood:  I wasn't impressed with it at all.  We went with the Tapas and each selected two items from the menu to contribute to the overall Tapas.  I was sadly disappointed to see that each order was ridiculously small.  We were a group of 7 and though we ordered two items each, it was sadly lacking.  The food was bland to say the least.\n\nIf you want to sit down and have some drinks friends in a fantastic atmosphere, this is the place to go.  If you want to good meal for a decent price, I'd recommend walking further down the road.	2
Just ate here again last night and had the shrimp scampi pasta, which was impressive, but I did have to add salt. Something is just lacking here. Ambience and portions and quality of the food ingredients are all great, but the food just is missing some kind of splash of flavor that would make it different and/or better than I could make myself at home. The shrimp, however, were HUGE and the addition of cilantro in the dish added a nice twist.	2
Hunnie Bunnie and I are getting breakfast before school! \nShe chose her Mac n Cheese which came with a side of fries. \nAnd I opted for the healthyish Veggie omelette with a side of fruit an an English muffin. \nBreakfast came out pretty fast and hot. \nI also discovered I don't mind swiss cheese as long as it's melted... Like inside my omelette. It was good! \nService was nice and friendly. We were in and out and on our way to school!	2
I thought it was average, mainly because of the price.  ayce sushi is hard to give a bad review unless the quality is just horrible.  I hated the fact that they only allow one order per person on certain items, like the Uni.  also, like other ayce sushi places they require you to eat the rice that comes with your piece you order, so there is no sashimi, and you cant just eat the meat and ask for more orders.  But for value I don't think you can beat it.	2
"Don't get me wrong - the food is Great, but even when you call in your order and given a time they are still slow... I\""m hoping as they work through the staff and get a few months under their belts the times will improve..."	2
Slow service, didn't take my Yelp coupon, Food was good. Very nice atmosphere, but I barely ever saw or heard from my waiter. I would not recommend if you don't have a lot of time to eat.	2
We had a very merry Christmas meal with a large group of Yelpers here. A charming interior, different from other places I am accustomed to visiting, more like your granny's lounge with a hint of expected victoria sponge. It feels like an odd choice, but it does work and down to the butter knives, reminds me a little of home. \n\nFood wise, I wasn't blown away, but it was all rather nice. Again, a bit like your gran. My starter wasn't particularly memorable - mushroom and polenta - to be honest, if I had thought about it, my reaction would be that neither have much flavour - and that was t the result, although it was laced with garlic. I did manage to steal some of the boys salmon... boy that was nice, much better as an option. Roseleaf shone right there and right then. I also enjoyed the mulled wine bread that was a precursor to the starter - and promised good things - nice touch there and pretty tasty at that. \n\nIt took a long time to deliver each course - by the looks of it, food was being prepped to deliver simultaneously - which is nice, but in a party of 20, I think perhaps the kitchen was a little challenged? There were definite murmurs of dissent from our end by the time the main finally arrived, which never bodes well and tends to leave a bad taste in the proverbial. The squash and nut Wellington I ordered took much longer than the other plates to arrive - me thinks it was holding things up. It was quite nice, although the large chunks of nut I crunched through was agonizingly painful due to a wisdom tooth coming in (note to self - nuts ain't soft, dude) - could have done with the nuts being a little less chunky, but that's a personal opinion. Brussel sprouts were manfully attempted and pretty tasty (lots of butter flavour), and overall the plate was pleasant, but I wouldn't say now that I would rush back for another slice. \n\nI was gluttinous - I did go for a third course - when you have cranachan and cheesecake in one, how are you going to say no? But ultimately, I was disappointed - the raspberry didn't cut through the richness of the cheesecake, and the lavender honey made it all the sweeter and heavy as did the accompanying jam berry combination. Loved the cinder toffee though.\n\nI did like the cock-pots (as Jenny L called em), the one we had had a fantastic name and went down as frighteningly well as a good cocktail should. But overall, much as Roseleaf is nice, and I had a lovely evening, I don't think it's a place I will rush back to  anytime soon - it's all very nice, but ask me in a month, and I probably won't remember much at all about the place, except the butter knives.	2
It's airport food, either owned by or using a famous person's name -- you are going to overpay - just deal with it! If the high prices at the airport bother you... eat BEFORE your come to the airport!\n\nBar service was friendly, and the food was ok. Don't expect the high end experience - but definitely better than most airport joints.	2
"THE FoOD IS AWESOME!!! For a bar! :) If your looking for a place to eat late night.. they rock!! Big screen TV's everywhere, free happy hour buffet on the weekdays, but best of all is that its a hole in the wall bar with best food ever!! Ya sure they have regular bar food.. but wait till to you see the 3 page menu of deliciousness served till 2AM!! YES.. 2AM!!  You name it! They have it! Pot roast mashed potatoes gravy... tacos.. french dip.. You ever ask yourself?..\""man.. its really late and Im hungry..\""..    North east corner of Broadway and Rural! See ya there!"	3
If there are two things I will not pretend to know jack about, they are pizza and burgers. The only thing I will attest to is what my taste buds like. California Pizza Kitchen is one of those places that some find as an atrocity to the art, but I opt for a different opinion. \n\nIt had been some time since I had visited a CPK, but after two years, I went there for dinner while on a trip to Disneyland. I had ordered the Moroccan chicken salad. It was so good, that I went back the next day, and have ordered it after coming back to Vegas. This salad is not your run of the mill greens, it is jammed pack with flavor and textures. Avocado, dates, roasted butternut squash, beets, carrots, dried cranberries, bell peppers, with a champagne vinaigrette dressing. With the blazon heatwave to come, I can see this being one of the dishes I will look forward to eating throughout summer.\n\nI am disappointed that they removed my favorite pizza, the Peking duck with hoisin sauce, but they still have the Japanese eggplant with goat cheese.  \n\nThey offer the option to switch out the regular crust with a honey whole wheat. It is a little healthier, gives a natural sweetness, and balances out the saltiness of the goat cheese.	3
"We discovered Zagrum today while wandering down Fleury after finding our usual diner breakfast joint closed. \n\nOur \""greasy spoon\"" breakfast of 2 eggs, sausages, brown toast, homefries, fruit and coffee cost $7. A bit pricey for a basic breakfast but at least the fruit was fancy (pineapple, strawberry, orange, melon, blackberry), the homefries were real potatoes (not frozen potato product), and the toast was made from good-quality bread. I also appreciated that they had soy milk available for my coffee.\n\nI couldn't help spying on the person at the table next to me, who had a \""maki roll\"" breakfast -- little rolls of crepes with smoked salmon and asparagus drenched in hollandaise. She seemed to enjoy it. I managed not to ask her for a bite."	3
"Only 4+ stars because 5 stars reserved for KA and  O \nThe beginning of the show, the crowd is entertained by a \""clown.\"" It is mostly mild and harmless audience abuse, but it ifs fun to watch---especially since it is happening to someone else... for those who haven't seen a Cirque show it combines mechanical magic, live music and spectacular \""circus\"" acts...when in Vegas see a Cirque show..."	3
I'm at the Village at Lake Las Vegas at least twice a year.  Once for the Brew Best Beer Fest in Spring, and again for their Beer Fest in the Fall.  The Village is also a great place to do photoshoots with the nearby lake, chapel on the bridge, and waterfall.  There are shops, restaurants, and a few casino properties nearby too that make it a nice destination to escape Vegas without having to drive too far.\n\nDuring the past year restaurants and shops have re-opened, and so has the Montelago Casino.  The lake still hosts boat races, winter ice skating, music at the lake; there are plenty of reasons to make the trek to the Village throughout the year.  The place will most likely be empty without an event, so be sure to visit while there is something going on.	3
I ate at Luciano's with 13 of my favorite coworkers for a birthday lunch. Customer service was amazing, and they got our checks right on the first try (something that seems to rarely happen when eating out with a large group that is paying separately). I love the ambiance of the place and am interested in trying their dinner menu. My only complaint is the price, prices are a bit high for lunch (they seem more like dinner prices in my opinion)... the price will likely keep me from coming back too often, but I will definitely keep it in the dinner repertoire!	3
Yes, I am a fan. Particularly of the brunches! They bake their pancakes which makes them ooooh so good. The King's cakes are delicious and are baked with bananas and chocolate in them and served with peanut butter (which I'm personally not a fan of). The portions are very very generous. On a nice day, the patio is great. Comfy seats, evap cooler outside, misting system. Most people don't know about their brunches I assume, since the entire place was empty when we were there at 10am. The dinners are great as well. The pulled pork sandwich and their pizzas are surprisingly good! It definitely has a commercial feel to it, but I believe it's a local business which I'm all for.	3
While I didn't hit up the restaurant portion, my girlfriend and I did stay for a weekend (circa November 2006) at the inn due to a recommendation from a friend who had lived in Montreal for a bit. The inn can definitely be described as a place for older couples. We were definitely the youngest ones around, which didn't bother us at all but might have bothered others around us. We weren't going to be loud or obnoxious, so please, stop giving us dirty looks.\n\nPerfectly situated in the older section of Montreal, the inn is within walking distance of many of the sites within old Montreal. We were also able to easily access any place outside of the older section while never being that far away from our hotel. \n\nMore on the actual inn.\n\nWe went during the off season (November) and spend $165/ night for the most basic room; a room with a queen sized bed and a complete bathroom. The room had views of a cathedral and its gardens, which probably would have been beautiful in the spring, but was not very impressive in the fall (obviously not the fault of the garden). Now, I'm not really accustomed to nice hotels, so I was quite impressed with the elegant hardwood floors, the wall sconce equipped with dimmers, the comfortable bed, the clean bathroom...etc etc. Perhaps I'm not the best one to say this, but it's definitely one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Breakfast the next morning was excellent, if a bit less filling than my usual morning meal.  Overall, the vibe was cozy, classy, intertwined with a bit of old school charm.	3
"Came into this place yesterday after the Pollo Mobile across the street ran out of Lengua and Huaraches! It was like 2p.m. so I decided to try a new place instead, Cilantro Tacos. This place hasn't been open long and to be honest, I never went in because of the name. I'm not a HUGE fan of cilantro so it was never really on my radar. Needless to say, cilantro is just a topping that you can ask to not have when you place your order so it's definitely not a big deal. Here's what I ordered for my wife and me and how it all stacked up. By the way, I have lived in California for about 6 years and have had Mexican food from many different places...so my descriptions are accurate :)\n\n1 Taco de pollo/chicken - Wife ordered this, so I just had a bite. Chunky pieces of chicken. Up to par with a standard Mexican place.\n\n1 Taco de al pastor/sauced pork - Wife ordered this, so again, I just had a bite. I'm not a fan of al pastor in general but from the bite I had, it was pretty good. Just the right amount of flavor to keep you coming back for more.\n\n1 Taco de carne asada/marinated steak - This is where it's at. Thick juicy cuts of carne asada packed with flavor. Depending on the sauce you get from the salsa bar, this can end up being a fantastic snack/meal(if you plan on having more than one).\n\n1 Taco de carnitas/pork - The carnitas I had at this place was probably some of the best carnitas I have ever had from any Mexican spot. Normally, when you order carnitas from any other place, you get small chunks of hardened pork that just doesn't do it for me. Cilantro Tacos carnitas is formulated of giant, soft, succulent pieces of pork with enough flavor to have me thinking about my next order for the subsequent time that I go. I don't know what I'll be getting the next time I go here, but one thing is for sure; At least one item that I end up getting will contain CARNITAS! lol :)\n\n1 Order of Cilantro Fries - Now, for the Main Course, we had the Cilantro Fries(for those that don't like Cilantro, don't let the name throw you off, this dish has practically nothing to do with cilantro). This dish starts off with a nice layer of french fries. On top of that, you have about half a gallon of cheese. On top of that you have thick cuts of carne asada. This is served with 2 small sides of guacamole and 1 small side of sour cream. If you play your cards right, you dump the 2 sides of guacamole diagnolly on opposite sides of the dish and dump the sour cream right in the middle. After going to town on these fries, I realized that my wife and I were fighting over who got the next bite. Next time I'll just get my own order. These were different from your standard carne asada fries in the sense that this was a little more gourmet. It didn't have as much asada as a standard place would have, but the quality made up for that. It also wasn't as salty as normal carne asada fries would be. I will definitely be having this dish again. \n\nAll in all, I have to give this place 5 stars for the following reasons;\n1.) Pricing is decent for the quality of food.\n2.) Meats(the ones that I like anyway - Carne Asada/Carnitas) were top notch and as I said before, \""If you're thinking of your next meal from the same place while you're eating, it's probably fantastic!\"")\n3.) Decor was great! I'm not a fan of Mexican music, but they had that playing in the background. Plus the place was super clean inside.\n4.) 5 Stars - I plan on trying some other things on the menu and will drop the rating if I either don't like it or they start to slack. I don't see that happening any time soon though.\n\n1 Gripe: My wife wanted me to mention that she wishes this place had Huaraches because she'd be here all the time if they did, lol. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a fantastic Mexican place to simply grub or grab a snack, Cilantro Tacos is the place :D\n\nI am the first to review this restaurant so maybe I could get hooked up with a discount in the future, lol!"	4
I can't believe how awesome this service was! My boyfriend and I thought it would be a hoax, but everything came out perfectly! No waiting in line, free admission for both of us and a free drink for me! Thanks Chris!	4
The best donuts in Arizona?  Yes.  Believe the hype because they're that good.\n\nOpen 24/7 with a drive through and an exceptional selection of donuts.  When I want a donut this is where I go.  I'll suggest the buttermilk, the apple fritters, and the glazed with white creme.\n\nFinally a few people have commented that the staff isn't all that friendly but in my trips there they were VERY helpful and in fact they made me a couple custom donuts while I was waiting.  Custom made fresh donuts.  How does it get better than that?\n\nThey aren't lying when they say, the best donuts in Arizona.	4
M has awesome buffet !  Wide selection of food, ranging from Italian, Greek, American, Japanese to Chinese with great service, relaxing ambiance and most of all, very affordable!  Kudos and keep it up!	4
"After paid $51 per person at the Buffet at Aria on Thanksgiving for not so impressive food, we decided to search for alternatives then I spot this small restaurant \u5c0f\u80d6\u5ddd\u83dcon the right side of the famous Chinese breakfast restaurant \""\u7fa9\u7f8e\u51a0\u8ecd\"".\n\nWe ordered 3 dishes and one soup. All of them are really delicious. I especially enjoy the soup\u9178\u83dc\u809a\u7247\u6e6f. It's so tasty and I have never had anything like it in USA. The meal only costs us $30. What a steal! Will definitely visit again."	4
"BEST. F*^&ING BUFFET. IN VEGAS. Hands down. \n\nPerhaps I am but a Vegas buffet noob; I've tried Planet Hollywood's Spice Market, the buffet in Caeser Palace, Rio's Carnival Buffet. I've also tried MGM's buffet, but that was quite a while ago and not fresh in my memory. In whatever case, I found something lacking in each of these buffets -- something that I could not grasp quite what it was, the je ne sais quoi that these buffets desperately needed. Everything that was missing, and then some, was found in the Buffet at the Bellagio. \n\nI vividly recall our long journey there. We set out from the Palazzo, preparing ourselves for the cold, bitter winds of the desert. Our stomachs growling, our limbs fragile from our fatigue...but we kept our eyes on the prize, focusing on the glowing lights that was the Bellagio.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, we set foot in the Bellagio. But our hopes plummeted when seeing the line that snaked around the wall. \""NOOO,\"" we cried in devastation. \""We'll NEVER get to eat!\""\n\nBut we had made the long journey there, after all, so we sought to see it through. The minutes seemed like hours, ticking by at a snail's pace.\n\n1.5 hours later, on a Sunday night, we reached the front of the line. $29.95 for dinner buffet! Not bad, not bad at all. We split our group of 8 into two small groups to avoid the mandatory 18% gratuity, and off we were!\n\nI almost plowed the waiter over in my haste to collect my prizes. \""Whoa, calm down there, miss!\""\n\nI threw a hasty, \""sorry!\"" over my shoulder before continuing onto the beauty I would soon behold. I piled mountains of smoked salmon, crab legs, sashimi (I have never, ever before found sushi at a buffet good, but Bellagio is the exception to this rule). At the table, my friends and I ate in silence, only pausing to say one of the following sentences:\n\n\""This is good.\""\n\""Is that good?\""\n\""You should try this, it's good.\""\n\nLess than an hour later, we laid in our chairs, breathing heavily. I had to mentally tell myself to breathe, or else I'd forgot to. I believe I ate every single thing in the buffet...\n\nNote: THE CREME BRULEE IS TO DIE FOR.\n\nEver since my visit, I have dreamt about this buffet. I kid you not. It was certainly the highlight of my trip to Vegas."	4
This place is THE park to go to if you have kids, visiting family or want an outdoor venue for a party. It's the perfect place to spend an afternoon with the fam! I found this park when my sister, bro in law and my almost 2 year old nephew came to town. Like most little ones, my nephew is fascinated by trains so we figured this was a good spot to check out. By the dazed, overwhelmed yet excited look in my nephew's eyes...he agreed.\n\nFirst off, it's easy to locate and prices for rides/attractions are cheap. The train ride is great for the kiddos and the line may look long but it goes fast. There's a carousel, playgrounds, food, souvenir shop and museums to peruse all afternoon. Some really cool photo ops too with the real trains, tracks and station building. The park has some really great shelters for hosting a party or bbq. Also, you can rent the inside of one of the trains for a private party...we peeked inside as a party was getting set up and it's absolutely adorable. Perfect for a little one's celebration if he/she is a fan of choo-choo's!	4
Central? Never heard of it , but I was at Caesars for the Elton John show and decided to check it out. Tuesday night and very busy but we were seated immediately and iced water was quickly provided. Wow! Best meal I have had in a while , very good server , he knew everything about everything on the menu.\nI had 6 oysters , served on ice with 2 sauces , beautiful. I then had a medium cooked rib eye with mushrooms . Outstanding! It's a meal fit for wearing sweatpants although the restaurant is far too nice for that comfortable attire. Wifee had Mozza ball (I'm not sure that's how it's spelled ) soup and fresh fish , flakey , perfectly cooked. Very nice cold Chardonnay and red wine with steak , lovely breads before the meal. Will I be back? You can bet your life. Oh..and Elton was brilliant , far better than the Red Piano show. Oh .....one more thing, I was delighted , really delighted to see NOT ONE GUY wearing flip-flops .	4

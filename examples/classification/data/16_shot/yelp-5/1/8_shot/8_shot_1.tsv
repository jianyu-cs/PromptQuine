Horrible customer service!  Store very unclean, something I over looked for a few visits, but when customer service went south, that was it!  AND my poor dog never got a drink of water hen he was there!  Never again!	0
Absolutely terrible experience. We sat down on a Saturday night after calling ahead to make sure there was a table for four available. The restaurant was busy, but not full. Our bottle of wine took about 7 minutes to arrive to our table. After we ordered, we waited waited and waited. 50 minutes after we ordered our food, we asked the waiter to bring our check, as we were running short on time. Our server informed us that the chef hadn't even started our food yet. He then handed us our tab for our bottle of wine and our table bread. They couldn't even comp the bread and wine? We waited for nearly one hour! As we were leaving, there were about 5 other table available in an otherwise small restaurant. There was no reason it should have taken so long. Extremely disappointed.	0
I just got here. Just arrived in the room and am abhorred at how terrible the room is. As my boyfriend is calling to switch hotels, I am writing this yelp review.\n\nFirst off, the room is terribly overpriced. For what this is, we should've paid $20/night.  The elevator and hallways are dilapidated. The bed cover has stains on it. There is popcorn and trash left under the bed. We can hear loud music from the strip below; I have no idea how people sleep here. The lady at the desk warned us that we could hear the music, but I didn't think that meant CLEARLY and LOUDLY. \n\nAt least offer ear plugs. \n\nDon't stay here. Ever.	0
The worst service ever.\n\nI was staying in the Charlotte Marriott - where Savannah Red is located - for the Democratic Convention. I worked on events at both Conventions having come from Tampa where the Republicans held theirs. I'd been in the concierge lounge with a couple friends where I'd had 2 drinks. We made our way down to the restaurant and sat at the bar to grab something to eat before we set out on our evening. We were having a fun conversation and laughing and when we ordered,  I was told I was cut off from having more to drink. Not my two friends but just me. It was the most bizarre thing ever. Never, ever had that happen. I was not drunk or unruly and the waitress and the manager refused to listen to reason. I wouldn't go back here if it was the last place on earth to eat.	0
Menu sucks, food blah! I'd rather eat at taco bell, and I don't even like taco bell. Crappy overpriced food and terrible service.	0
"We had the worst experience with this place! My husband's alterations were dropped off and paid on July 2013, additional alternations were needed, and therefore he left his suits to be picked up on a later date.\n\nFirst Trip: My husband works abroad, therefore I went to pick up the alterations on  August 2013, with a receipt marked PAID.  The lady (owner) stated the alternations were not paid and refused to relinquish my husband suits, even with the receipt marked PAID.  Her theory: if the other two carbon receipts were not marked PAID, the transaction did not occur.   \n\nSecond Trip: My husband was very adamant about the fact that he paid and he reassured me. I went back to the shop and asked if she could research her records plus the receipt was marked PAID.  She refused to relinquish the suits; she was very rude and basically ignored me. \n\nThird Trip: Now, I am second-guessing my husband, because this is asinine. However my husband has a great memory and he deals with numbers all day therefore I attempted to visit the shop again.  She still refused to relinquish the suits. I asked again if she could \""please\"" check her financial records, check the register...anything... I just want to pick up my husband suits. \n\nStill no suits...my husband spent some time checking our bank statements and there was a payment of $114.00 made on July 5, 2013 with a reference number from Matthews Alterations.  My husband immediately called the owner, she told him, the police had his suits.  I called the lady and stated we had proof we paid and I can swing by and bring our statement...she immediately cut me off and said she was going to call the police and that his suits were at the police station. She also mentioned we didn't want to pay for the suits we just wanted a free service.  \n\n After the phone call, I had a police officer call me and asked if I could meet him at the shop.  I arrive at the shop and there were two squad cars. I showed the police  proof of payment as well as well as the owner. She then tried to say my bank statement wasn't real, wanted to copy my bank statement (which is illegal) and just because the word \""PAID\"" was not written on her calendar marked July 5th the payment was not real.   The police officer had to reassure her the bank statement was legit.  \n\nLong story longer...the look of total humiliation on her face was indeed priceless.  At each attempt, my husband and I were never disrespectful, and kept every visit professional. She was very rude, unprofessional, voided my existence, and lied about the suits being at the police station.\n\nHer bookkeeping is antiquated and suspicious and the shop is filthy! This could have been resolved in a timely manner, saving me gas, my time, and wasted tax dollars for calling Matthews Police department if she just would have provided me with Customer Service 101 by researching her financials.  She needs to be audited by the IRS!"	0
Okay, Let me just say....I'm not sure if it was food poisoning, or I coincidentally came down with a stomach bug 4 hours after eating their pizza.....but after my 36 hour adventure with my toilet and the bathroom floor, I can't say I'm willing to give this place another shot....not to mention the pizza really wasn't even worth my misery.\n\nSo, the pizza itself. I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza. \n\nOn the plus side, the girl working the counter was very peppy and nice. \n\nSo, if your going to try this place, I recommend skipping the spinach trio...maybe it was the feta that poisoned me.....good luck, I hope you have a better experience that I....if you're the brave type.	0
OK-I realize this should not be a surprise.  But, in a stupor of holiday exhaustion, I ordered a Pan-Normous pizza for me and my kids.  My children, apparently already slaves to advertising, REALLY wanted to try it.  It turned out to be a good education for the difference between what something looks like on TV, versus real life.  ( I am sure there is a deep life lesson here, but I was too irritated to take advantage of it)  There was nothing enormous about the pizza, which is my main complaint.  I asked the guy on the phone how many people it would feed, he said 8.  Ummm-8 tiny people.  It was also, not good, but again, not surpised at that.  So I think I will be thankful that now my kids know how gross Pizza Hut is too.	0
I bought a new iMac online and they automatically add Kaspersky protection unless you remove it from the order. \n\nI saw the remove button just as I was pressing the complete purchase button. They would not refund that portion because it's software. \n\nI called Customer Support and a supervisor there would not issue a refund. Policy is policy. So they're losing my business over a little thing. I have two words for Best Buy----Apple Store.	1
Have stayed at Excalibur many times throughout the years. I had called while on the way to Vegas driving to reserve a room. Was told on the phone that would be cheaper to make reservation online because I would be charged 10.00 to do over phone. What the heck? So went online reserved room. Got a email and two rooms were reserved instead of one. Called to resolve the problem. Was hung up on, put on hold indefinitely, told I could not get money back cancellation policy was 48 hours. Finally after 2 hours decided to deal with once in Vegas. The girl who helped us check in was very helpful. refunded money, upgraded us, and gave us a late check out. After checking in and paying it was the same price as I was quoted over the phone. They don't tell you online that there is a 20 resort fee. \n\nAnother thing is make sure you eat before it gets late. The food places all shut down. This is something new since last time I was in Vegas. Always had a 24 coffee shop open. After walking upstairs and downstairs and all around per the staff telling us of food places that may be open. We ended up at 2 in the morning at New York New York which apparently is the only restaurant open near Excalibur for food.	1
Sushi was good, but the service was terrible.  The server forgot 2 of the orders, and also got one of the orders wrong and argued with us that we didn't say to hold the sauce.  Also argued with me that I ordered an item I did not order.   No apologies made for the mistakes. \n\nThe service needs to be at least on par with the food and price.  Not the case at this restaurant.  Too many other options in uptown Charlotte to have poor service and survive.	1
"I'll start by saying I enjoyed the concert I saw last night, but... While it is just a music venue and my expectations weren't set that high, the marquee failed to live up to even those.\n\nI was there with Andrew K, and agree about the fees, the line to get in, and the sticky floors. The sign of a good venue is how efficiently they handle crowds, and they fail at this. But I'd also like to talk about the bar. The servers were friendly enough, but they had tacky hand written in marker signs that read \""we can only run your card once, please start a tab.\"" When I tried to oblige, I was told their system can only handle 100 tabs so I couldn't. Ridiculous."	1
Not worth a visit. The employees are respectful and nice, but no personality. More like zombies walking around doing their jobs. I ordered coconut chicken soup. Should have been called mushroom soup as that's the majority in the soup. The soup itself was bland. Bland enough to not want to drink the soup but trying fishing for the bits of chicken inside. My other half ordered mint pork (his normal Thai order). He said the hotness was perfect. And the taste was awesome for him. I suppose if we did come back it would be for him only and to go. My daughter ordered beef broccoli. She liked the beef and broccoli, but the sauce has too much clam juice which made her feel she was eating more of a fish entree. The customers who come in seem to be more on the ghetto side so expect to hear loud mouth complaints. But I must say the employees took at it well but in a robot motion. Think zombies. Lol you know they were cussing the ghetto people out in the kitchen lol. Over all not a place to visit, but if you want to gamble a good visit then go ahead.	1
"I recently stayed at the Golden Nugget on a Vegas trip, as we were interested in being near Binions, our favourite poker tournament location across the road.\n\nFirst the good... The place, since the renovation is beautiful. The blown glass everywhere is stunning, and the shark tank pool is really quite something. Sitting outside at night under the stars with a free-pour (but pricey) drink from the pool area bar is really relaxing. The beds in the rooms are comfortable.\n\nDon't bother purchasing Wifi (at $18 a day) - go down the road to Denny's where it's free all the time.\n\nNow, the bad. The rooms were absolutely nothing special. Bring your own Keurig cups as they want $10 for FOUR Keurig cups if you open the box... I'm serious! $10! You have to pay $20 a night to get a fridge in your room, the \""view\"" room was of a parking lot (not that there's much to see that high up on Freemont Street, anyhow. The service is TERRIBLE in all the restaurants and bars in the place.\n\nFor example... my husband and I received a coupon book when we checked in for our 5 day stay, and in the book was a couple of drink coupons for a bar in the hotel/casino. We sat no less than 40 minutes waiting (AT the bar...) with the coupons (AND tip up front...) while the bartenders whizzed by us, despite us requesting politely to be served each time they went by. The service was no better in any other part of the casino bars and restaurants.\n\nThe other primary complaint? The timeshare people camped out posing as hotel staff at your elevator entrance to the hotel... You can't get away from them, and had to pass through a gauntlet of hounding every time you got off the elevators! It's harrassment, and annoying as hell.\n\nFinally, a tip: If you get a coupon (should you stay here) for the buffet, know that it's only good for Mon-Thursday. The breakfast buffet on weekdays is relatively inexpensive, and the quality of food is good for the price. Do check it out (upstairs on the third floor)."	1
I cannot say how disappointed I am with this pizza place. I've read and heard so many good things. \n\nFood quality - 1 star\nInside of my pizza box lay a black ring of burnt crust with a smattering of toppings tossed on top. The crust was burnt so much we could not eat it. I know a brick oven crust has some character and some char to the edges, but this was ridiculous. We paid $2 each for four different toppings. For $2 of onions, I counted 13 pieces of onions. $2 for a small handful of jalape\u00f1o STEMS. The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can. The sausage was the only tasty topping on our pizza. The cheese was as flavorless as the crust. Maybe if the cheese was burnt, it would have had some flavor. \n\nFood price - 1 star\nCompared to similar pizza places, excluding the fast food pizza places like Pizza Hut, the prices are a little high. If you only want a couple of toppings, your pizza will be cheap. If you like a lot of toppings, you should bring you last paycheck. My four topping, large pizza, complete with flavorless cheese and a burnt crust came two $25. \n\nOverall, not a great experience. I'm confident in saying I would rather have a slice of pizza from my school's cafeteria. Too much money and way too much disappointment.	1
Pharmacy service sucks. Takes FORVER to get your meds. The staff seems really unorganized. Not writing anymore. They took too much of my time up already.	1
Went to Blue Hound a couple of nights ago for the first time with friends.  The hotel and restaurant had a cool and hip atmosphere.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the place was not crowded.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable and recommended several things on the menu including the special which was soft shell crab over an artichoke coulis with fiddlehead fern.  I ordered the special (and a shot of gazpacho) and the others at the table ordered a flatbread pizza and tater tots (yum!), the salmon, and the chicken.  When the salmon came out, it was such a tiny portion and my friend commented on it.  I had an option of ordering one or two crabs with my dinner and I opted for one after asking our server if it would be plenty of food.  I should have ordered two.  The food at Blue Hound is creative, ubber fresh, and delicious.  However, we all left still feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes.  We talked about ordering more food but the items are quite pricey and our bill was already over $100 without tip (only two of us had an alcoholic drink).  We eat out frequently at all of the new hip and trendy places that are opening all over Phoenix and feel that with all the other restaurants who are now offering creative farm to table food at  lower prices and larger (yet reasonably sized) portions, Blue Hound has some adjusting to do.  It would be a tough sell to get me to go back unless I knew our bellies would be full and our bill not so high.	2
"Solid burger and fries... High prices. \n\nGiven the type of casino this is, I would really want to spend over $5 for a burger and fries meal. Yes, that is an option for lunch... But they don't advertise it inside the restaurant and you can't really \""build your own\"" unless you want to pay about $7-9 a head. \n\nService was ok ... We had to wait at the cash register to order because there wasn't even anyone there. They also make you tip after ordering which is kinda lame since you haven't eaten or experienced the service yet. \n\nI probably won't be back."	2
Standard cafe with more food offerings than most on willy but cash only and limited places to pop a squat. Aaand by limited I mean unless you're solo or dos options are slight.	2
I'll admit it.  I found this place, but I had to cheat by reading Yelp reviews (thanks guys).  Also, it's between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo. :p\n\nThe NY look definitely brought back memories of my trip to New York from last year.  The prices for the pizza are rather expensive for a New York style pizza, but I figured it had to be adjusted for Las Vegas, so that's understandable.  With that said, I was fine with it, really.\n\nI grabbed a slice of the White Pizza, and it was delicious.  Oily, but still great.  Luckily there was a small line, so the wait wasn't as long as I thought it was going to be on a week night.  Overall though, it's perfectly acceptable for late night pizza, especially when under the influence of alcohol.	2
Now I remember why I only get a smoothie once every 2 years. \n\nI can't afford them.\n\n$13 something for a medium and a small smoothie, wow. I think I'll stick with costco's smoothies.	2
"Good place with a lot of options for lunch.  You can even customize your sandwich here if you aren't feeling up to their many sandwich options.\n\nI think all McAlister's feel a bit the same... you get \""herded\"" to the back of the location to a bank of registers to order.  The staff at most of these locations are pretty friendly and helpful... sometimes you feel a little rushed if the line is starting to build and they try to get you through.  You are given a number to place on the table and the bring out the food to you nice a hot/fresh.\n\nThis location offers free wi-fi but I haven't brought my computer to test it out yet.  I've seen people working or meeting with laptops here.\n\nThe thing I HATE about this location in the university area is the parking lot.  It is impossible to get in and out easily and the spaces are all for compact cars, which makes for some interesting parking lot stories and near misses."	2
I made the trek to Jerusalem, took a risk considering it was a Sunday and a holiday weekend, but lo and behold they were open.  It is a crazy little restaurant.  It is  a hole in the wall, dingy, needed a good scrub, but you know, sometimes the best foods are found in these kinds of places.\n\nA young man rang me up and I asked him is there lettuce and tomato on the falafel, remembering Julia S said she wanted more on her sammiches.  So I was being slick and ordered extra lettuce and tomato on mine and I ordered a side of tabouli.   \n\n\nJerusalem's tabouli was good, it was exactly how I like it, dry, not wet with oil and more parsley than bulghar. YUM!\n\nThe falafel I thought was average, I have had much better, but it was only $2.99, so for $3 I don't even want to complain. There was no lettuce on mine, good thing I asked for extra!!!  It was garnished with tomato and pickle only.    I got two sandwiches and a side of tabouli for $10.  \n\nA man walked in and asked what the special was and it was rice with eggplant and chicken, it looked good, I meant to ask how much the special was, but I got so excited when he handed me my food, I forgot.  Next time.	2
I wish I could put 3.5 stars instead. The food was actually really delicious (although, we mostly ordered fried food) and it wasn't too salty for my grandma to eat.  \nWhat makes me give them the lower rate is the cleanliness of the restaurant itself.  We sat at a small table that was against the wall (not exactly a booth) and the walls were dirty.  Like food had been splashed all over the wall and was never cleaned nor scrubbed down.  That grossed me out a little, but I forgot about that as soon as I got my food.  The waiters were actually attentive and really friendly.  Keep in mind, this was on a busy night as well, so I'm surprised that a lot of people on here say that they had received slow service.	2
So many wonderful options! I went to food good and picked local loaf. I love the food there but I also love the atmosphere of the whole place. I would def recommend it to everyone in the area. I'll be back soon!	3
You have to try their pumpkin with crispy rice and grilled food.  It can't really compare to Raku but its the 2nd alternative best to Raku.  This place is better than their sister restaurant Naked sushi.  Even the sushi rolls here are done more professional.   The service is good, too.  \nThey do have a pretty good sake menu which I love.  \nThis place is usually not super packed so there is no need to make reservation which is always a plus when you in the mood for good japanese food.	3
Always leery of a menu in the mail box, but Niyo was worth the time. Sushi bar and full menu available at reasonable prices. Combo platters are generous enough for two. Soups are hot and tasty. Steam dumplings were delicious! Tempura veggies were fresh, tender and NOT oily. The staff welcomed us and were eager to please. I do believe we have a new favorite.	3
Pretty big portions, food tastes soooo good, decent customer service.  The short ribs with peppers is very good and also the pork intestine house style is good too, and also the braised pork chops!	3
When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect.	3
Awesome service and very kid friendly.  Charlie and Joe were amazing helping me find what I needed while shopping with my 3 kids.  I would highly recommend Living Spaces...great service, good prices and impeccable service.	3
The food here was very good and service was quick. I got the sangria margarita and while it was tasty it was definitely weak on the alcohol. The ambiance is also a little lacking and could use some updating. But overall a good experience.	3
It's good, convenient and it's one of the few Chinese restaurants that cooks with gluten free soy sauce.  I'm sensitive to wheat/gluten and great tasting fast food is not really an option anymore.  I especially love their pork fried rice, beef chow fun and chicken and vegetable with the white garlic sauce.  Big portions too - we always get at least 2 meals - dinner and lunch the next day!  Friendly staff too.	3
This seems to be my wife's favorite place lately. The food is always fresh and good! I just wished it wasn't in the middle of the shopping center.	4
This place rocks!  We just relocated to Las Vegas and I needed a wax bad so I thought I would try The Birthday Suit.  I have been getting waxed for 7 years and this is the best ever!  Stacey knows her stuff, it is quick and painless.  The other staff is awesome, they email you a reminder for your next appointment and give you a call.  I will not go anywhere else.  Also if you friend them on Facebook they are always running specials.  Also since I was new to the area I asked the receptionist for a nail place to get a pedicure and she reccomended a great one and Stacey reccomended a great babysitter for us to!	4
Very light tasting custard mixed with mango or any flavor of choice. What can be wrong with that!? Well nothing if its Rita's that's for sure. Place is wonderful been here multiple times within the first week I discovered the place. \n\nVery friendly staff is always a plus! They get it right every time. Definitely willing to make sure your experience is the best. Thanks again Rita's and staff for an amazing get away.	4
"Please open a location in Santa Monica!  Tried the ostrich burger while traveling and need to have it more often.  Great, quick service and high quality nutritious food (actually healthy not \""healthy-like\"").  Good variety - want to try everything on the menu!"	4
They should add a tagline to Nicky's Thai Kitchen as Thai food heaven. If you are from out of town (like me), don't be fooled by the entrance of this restaurant. Once you go it, just ask for a table outside and you would be surprised to see the decor and the Thai cultural design of their outdoor seating. \n\nMy wife and I visited the National Aviary which is less than a mile from this restaurant. We spent almost 5 hours at the aviary and wanted to eat lunch at around 3PM. So, I looked up nearby Thai restaurants on Yelp and Nicky's shows up first on the list. Quick look at the reviews and menu on my phone and we were on our way to check this place out for ourselves. Luckily found metered parking right in front of the restaurant. We entered not being very sure how much longer the restaurant will be open for lunch. There were hardly any people dining inside the restaurant. My wife asked to be seated outside even though it was around 90+ degrees heat. When we walked out through the wooden structures and plants and golden buddha statues and entered the outdoor seating area, it was 75% occupied and the Sun didn't even seem to bother any of us. \n\nThe menu is extensive with all the traditional Thai dishes. We ordered a veg fried rice and a eggplant stir fry with tofu. Both the dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. Everything tasted real good and the staff service was very nice. We clicked a ton of pictures of the place as it was very beautifully done with waterfalls and statues and wooden wheels etc. When the bill finally arrived it was less than $20  for a heavy meal with excellent service and ambience.	4
"Its a typical Saturday morning. \nYou're hungover, and the girl laying next to you, the one who looked like a million bucks last night, now looks like the face on an Indian Penny. \nYou want her gone, but for some reason, she's loitering. \nStalling. \nPutting off the inevitable cab ride / walk  'o shame, despite your best efforts to assure her you'll call.\n\nThen something comes out of her mouth so stupefying, it's got you re-thinking your entire life.\n\""Hey, it's Saturday\"" she says, \""Why don't we head up to Rock Springs for the Hogs 'n Heat barbecue party?\""\nShe just said the magic word. Barbecue.\nNothing, you reason, could be better for this headache than some pulled pork and a few beers. Maybe the drive and the fresh air will help, you reason.\nShe goes on.\n\""Its not just barbecue...oh its all the usual stuff...brisket, chicken, ribs. But they've got this thing I really love, something you can't get anywhere else... Rocky Mountain Oysters.\""\n\nDid she just say what I think she said? \nShe wants me to drive her 50 or so miles so she can eat testicles? Holy shit, who is this person. Some kind of Nazi War Criminal?\nJesus! \nFear sets in as you reason how YOUR balls could be her next meal if you don't concede to her unusual gastronomic request.\nHungover, and with all the countenance of a zombie, you drive to Rock Springs. \n\nThe first few beers slide down. They go good with the free popcorn in the bar.\nThen a couple of shots. The barbecue is fantastic...the hangover winding down.\n\nAnd finally the coup de gras as you watch her wolf down an entire plate of nuts. \nYou're sick again, and before losing it altogether, yakking on a faux-biker and getting shot to death, you wander off. \nIt's there you find, like a shining beacon of light, Aunt Jenny's Pie Stand in all its glory.\n\nTime for a break from all of this nonsense. \nYou grab a pie, head for the parking lot, and finally rid yourself of this bovine-eating Nazi once and for all. \n\nAs you're driving home, the Jack Daniels pecan pie slopped all over your being, a wave of terror washes over you, realizing how she knows where you live.\nYou turn the car around.\nThis isn't over yet.\nGod help you."	4
Best ice cream shop ever! So happy that it's so close to my house! Me and my husband have been going to Mixers since High School! I was so sad to hear that at one point it was close to closing! They have added a lot of new things that I'm excited to taste! Their homemade ice cream is awesome!	4
Fun, great food, classic old-school feel.	4

We picked out desserts - purple taro cake, black forest cake, egg custard and cappuccino mousse.  It is hard to believe but over the course of the following several days we shared each one and all were unexceptional.	0
The wait staff was nice. I ordered a burger that came with a moldy bun. When I told the waitress the cook only sent me a fresh bun rather than remaking the burger. I refused to eat it a got a hassle when I told them I wasnt going to pay. On the way out I peeked in the kitchen. It was dirty. Not just new dirt but nasty buildup around the grill and fryers.	0
Sam's Chicago Style Pizza & Wings is .....CLOSED	0
waaaay too crowded and absurdly expensive drinks. security inside would not let us stand for one second, made us keep walking back and forth. the dance floor was a mosh pit and was not fun. I got separated from my friends and only stayed for an hour	0
I went to this location on the way home from work to see if they could help me with my email set up and a leather case i just bought 4 weeks prior.  As I was talking about the case that fell apart and kept dropping my phone the counter person said there is no warranty on leather cases and nothing they could do , i asked just make me a deal on another one and they said no again.  Out of the blue a homosexual man and his partner next to me started yelling at me and saying I was an asshole? Wow this place is a trip poor service and idiots inside.  This is a cooperate store and they really don't give a shit about their customers.  They never even helped me with my email either.  I then went to the location on greenfield and mckellips not a cooperate store with errogant assholes and they helped me problem solved.	0
We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fianc\u00e9 says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again	0
Yuk. Dirty and gross	0
"I have enjoyed this restaurant in the past but I will NEVER step foot there again.   For several weeks now I have been planning a fieldtrip for my class so that they could taste some of their food.   I've been hyping it up all week to my students and I made my reservation long ago.   They asked me to come by a day or two before to give them the final numbers.   When I came in to do that, I spoke to the owner and the chef and they said \""we feel bad but we can not accommodate you!\""   They said that they had no record of my reservation and that I didn't speak to the right person.   I called their reservation number and they transferred me to the person who actually makes reservations, that is their fault, who else did I have to speak to?   I can't believe that they are so disorganized.   Anyway, so then I asked to see the reservations they had for the day I asked and voil\u00e0!   There I was my name plus 20 people !   What shocked me next is that they still refused to accommodate us!   It is really outlandish that they would take a reservation for a school and have me and my administration go trough hoops and hurdles to have this fieldtrip approved, fill out paperwork, get 2 substitute teachers, get and submit permission slips to then just cancel it without notice the night before !   To do this to me is one thing but to do it to our children who have been looking forward to this reward for weeks is unspeakable!!!   What kind of horrible example are we giving to our children, that it is okay not to keep your word?!"	0
There were 12 of us that ate at this crowded and cramped place, with stinky overflowing restrooms in Las Vegas. \nThe food was delicious. Some dishes could be less greased with butter, but overall the food was good in comparison to mid-range Indian restaurants in the US - although it was priced higher than most in its range. \nThe wait was long as there are few tables to seat. Restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners. A common problem with most Indian restaurants like this one. If the food is good, the price is high - but no funds are diverted to keeping the restaurant clean for a clean experience. Where does all the cash go - not to the poor low-cost undocumented workers ????	1
Casino review (not hotel/rooms) -- the dealers at this casino are some of the most uptight who won't indulge in conversation, won't even smile, in fact, we kept getting ID'ed even though we were much older which got really annoying..	1
I love Hot wings.  love love love hotwings, and although I AM a chick - I still dig going to Hooters, and from what I've learned there is a HUGE HUGE difference between locations for quality of food.\n\nThis one is at the low end of my rating scale - although our server Tiffany was one of the nicest and most knowledgable of servers we have had yet in any of the locations.\n\nThe wings (911 and 3mile) 's sauce was almost gritty like sand in texture and the celery was limp.  The battered shrimp were rather soggy too (as if they were not frozen all the way thru prior to cooking)\n\nNot a great one, but from what I learned not a francise - one of the 'staple' locations. Which makes me wonder - which has better food, the chicken or the egg?	1
I like to judge a chinese restaurant by their shrimp fried rice.  It tells me how good their chef is with flavor, how fresh the ingredients are since it is seafood, and how powerful the wok is to get that nice finish for the fried rice.\n\nThe shrimp was mushy and old, the rice was not flavorful.  Second time I've come here.  I was not impressed the first time around, and definitely not impressed this time when I tried to give it another chance.  Too bad, damn...	1
Went here for the first time with a gift certificate that I received for my birthday. The people at the front desk were so nice and got me green tea asi was directed to the manicure station. The girl doing my nails was nice and personable, but stopped a few times to talk to other employees in the middle of the service. I personally want my cuticles clipped and I like to see that they have taken the dry skin off. It's a pet peeve when they don't. Heads up, they don't clip the cuticle at all. After the manicure was done, while my nails looked pretty,it felt like I just had a polish change. \nNow on to the pedicure..pretty decor and comfy tufted chairs. ( in my opinion the atmosphere of this place is so much better then the service you are receiving.) no massage in chairs, no jets in the bowl, no cuticle remover put on my feet. They were soaked for maybe 30 seconds before she took maybe a few small cuticles off and trust me they needed a lot of work. Massage was great but lasted about 20 seconds per foot. And that is being generous. Paid extra for callus remover and still had dry feet when I left. When I went to check out the total was 60 dollars! Are you serious?! I will stick to my trusty nail salon any day over this over priced frou frou nail bar. Also if you want to indulge.. Go to DryBar and have a blowout next door...so much better.	1
After 5 years in Phoenix and so much anticipation of trying Coronado Cafe, I was extremely underwhelmed. Nothing was bad. Nothing was stellar. I didn't hate my meal, but was more perplexed by raving reviews after such a mediocre experience.\n\nWe kicked off our dinner with the infamous crab cakes which were delicious no doubt. That's where the enthusiasm ended. Having enjoyed them so much I decided to order the crab soup of the day which had a tomato and vegetable base and threw in a half Greek salad for good measure. My other half got the cheese burger. The soup tasted old and had no special quality to it with mushy veggies and completely pulled apart crab strings that made this like a tortilla soup without the spice. The salad was served on basic yellow romaine with no distinguishing qualities that set it apart from Souper Salad or Olive Garden.  For $11, I can't say I was thrilled. My beau's burger charted the same on his satisfaction scale - nothing to write home about.\n\nThe people were very sweet and the ambiance was cozy, but the ambiance was also...quiet. Very quiet, like empty quiet.  Perhaps brunch is bustling on weekends and the different menu poses more potential. But we won't be back for dinner.	1
Come here if you want terrible service. Food is decent but the service and quality of people working here is ridiculous.	1
First off, I would've gave this place 4 stars because the food was fantastic. \nSadly, the service was not!\n\nWe sat ourselves and had to wave the waitress down for some waters. \nAlso waited 15 mins for our bill & she took so long to even pick up the bill that I, finally just walked up to cashier to pay. \nI get that she's alone and it just opened but c'mon management...\n\n\nImmediately ordered the soup dumplings (unsure of the Chinese name) because this is the only place my friends know of that has this. Got the steamed and pan fried ones.\n\nWhen we got the steamed ones, I had to ask my friends how to even eat it if there's hot soup in the dumplings. \nThey said to eat/bite the top of the dumplings, let it steam out, and add the sauce. \nThat itself was really fun for me. I mean, who doesn't like playing with their food =)\n\nThe soup in the dumplings were delicious and savory. Tasted amazing with the dough! Pan fried/seared dumplings were my favorite of the two.\n\nAlso, ordered the onion pancake, I believe...I think that was the name.....?\nAnd THAT was sooooooo YUM. Crunchy and tasty, like sour cream and onion chips...if I had to compare it to something....\n\nAfter this experience and bad service, we'd love to try more soup dumplings so, we yelped it... Found a couple places thru Yelp! \nOtherwise, this place is our last resort because of the lacking service!	1
Food was excellent as was the setting. I had super service till after the entree and then the waiter never returned. It was such an abrupt contrast to the attentiveness I had received that I'm rating a 3 star. No one asked about coffee and I waited  forever to get my check.	2
Here's the thing...you definitely get what you pay for. We stayed there literally overnight so it was a very quick stay. It was a great deal at $60 for the night which included parking and a quick continental breakfast in the am. \n\nThe hotel's interior looks more like a dorm than a hotel. The rooms are....fine. Some of the pillowcases and bedding was questionable but we kept telling ourselves it's just one night. \n\nThe biggest problem was THE SMELL. We were in a non smoking room but this room had a unique funk all it's own. It was not good. Oh and our room had a view of the pool which we realized had no water in it and had two deck chairs turned over just chilling at the bottom of it *shrug*\n\nBut the staff was super friendly and cheerful and they had some great options for their continental breakfast. Plus we scored great parking outside the front entrance. \n\nSo I probably won't go back there again, but like i said, you get what you pay for. ;)	2
Have you seen the Holiday? You know that cute English/LA Christmas movie with Kate Winslet, Jack Black, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law? This Irish pub is that lovely pub. Super cozy, one of those places that everyone knows your name.\n\nNestled a few minutes away from Villa-Maria metro and right in NDG, this place was a beacon from Montreal's chilly weather. The moment we sat down and took our jackets, tuques, scarves and mitts off I immediately felt comfortable and the pints - Newcastles, Griffin's, Guinness' came. \n\nI had fish and chips (yum!) and my friends had cheeseburgers and fries (yum!!). \nWish this place was round the corner from my place... I'd be a regular.\n\nLocal tip - this Irish pub menu has Sir Lankan curries; kitchen staff are Sri Lankan and the curries were highly recommended by friend and local NDGer.\n\nYou can find them on twitter @YOOPub	2
Okay -- I will admit this this place was going to be a hard sell for me. I am not a huge ramen fan but the idea of a campus ramen restaurant has always intrigued me. I took my daughter, a big Doodles fan, to lunch today. She got her usual Pad Thai Doodle with bean sprouts and mushrooms and I got the Coconut Tom Doodle with fishballs. Thank goodness that we got in when we did since we were followed by a group of around a dozen people.\n\nI thought my soup was fine and I know my daughter enjoyed hers, as well as the four berry smoothie she received.\n\nNegatives: They seemed be be out of ingredients for a few of the drinks and the place had  musty smell to it.\n\nSo ... I thought Doodles was okay, but not the kind of place I would go to again. But for a college student looking to get a quick, hot lunch on the cheap, I can see why this place would be very attractive.	2
Servers are very polite but chips are stale, salsa has great taste though. Carnitas are very tender and portions are suitable. Place is kind of small and cramped.	2
"I miss the Tommy Pastrami's that was in this location, but my Carne Asada Fries are biking distance now. So, not much of a loss. \nI notice very little deviance from the other Roberto's locations, which means this is \""the\"" taco shop with a duplicate-able sense of business.\n \nThis particular location does offer green onions in the salsa bar, which is a plus, but while self-serve salsa bars seems to be a trend in Mexican cuisine, I would not trust the area with these gringos. Remember, these are the same guys that taught terrorists to fly but not land, and why Las Vegas businesses have such a false sense of security. So, if they can't police their own safety, what makes you think they can handle a salsa bar. I've posted similar concerns with U-Swirl and Yogurtland. Self serve areas in food service is a foolish idea, especially in a fast food atmosphere.\n\nNonetheless, I come here for machaca, chorizo, and breakfast burritos. This is also my place for quesadillas and horchata; perfect amount of cinnamon. I do wish they had tacos de cabeza. The only location I remember seeing this was at Maryland near UNLV. \n\nI dine out a lot over the past 30+ years, and I only got sick at Jack-in-the-box (twice) and Burger King once. So, this place is the cleanest of its kind, and the service is also really fast. \n\nI think I'll go there now.\n\n_______________________________________-____-_____\nWell, I just came back from there, and I was slightly peeved. \nThe salsa bar was amazingly messier than any time I've ever seen it, and it was only 9:30 in the morning. \nI ordered my regular carne asada fries but I wasn't in the mood to eat a whole order, and since they only have one size, I asked them to put it into 2 separate smaller containers instead. She said they could not do that for me. But she was able to give me 2 empty small containers along with my regular order.  The adjustment is very small and would take only 10 seconds to split the ingredients into 2 smaller containers. That kind of inflexibility shows me some inexperience with the cooks.\nThe service was still fast, but what was once a 4 star place has dropped one whole star because they could not accommodate such a minor request.\nI went home and took a spatula and split it myself. It took 5 seconds, but the ingredients did not adhere like the original prepared presentation. If they did it I would be happy. But like most businesses in the US, it's not their job to make me happy- nor is it my job to tip them."	2
"I have been putting this review off for a while because I was uncertain how to put pen to paper, but I can't procrastinate any longer.  I am going to treat this review much like a work related evaluation and utilize the \""compliment sandwich\"".  So here it goes.\n\nA great shout out to Rachel C, our CM for organizing the event and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for supplying our tickets to the show.  It was great finally being able to meet Rachel and the generosity of the PCT was phenomenal.  I will never turn down an opportunity to view any event at the beautiful historic Benedum Center.  Again many thanks!\n\nNow as far as the \""musical\"" goes I will point out as others have, this was originally written as an opera.  I am not a fan of operatic singing and though I liked several of the songs the switching back and forth from operatic signing to more main stream musical was not pleasing to my ears.  I barely could understand the words when they were belted out in this format.  The storyline was ok, however it had several racist undertones depicting African American's during this time period as fighting, gambling, drinking, drug abusing criminals.  The story was also at times hard to follow, possibly because of the manner of the singing which left me disinterested at some times.  I have seen several musicals at the Benedum and this was the most disappointing.  \n\nFurthermore, for the last piece of bread on my sandwich, I really think the actors did a great job.  I may not be a huge fan of this work, but I think the cast was top notch, and acting and dancing were entertaining.  And as always any event at the Benedum is worth going to as 9 times out of 10 the experience is splendid."	2
Not the best but definitely convenient if you're rushing or want a quick bite.  It's a also a little more pricey than it should be, but then again it is a restaurant in a Casino.  I'm a fan of the Red Dragon Roll, Cajun Albacore and the Mackerel Sashimi.  Go at the right time and grab a table overlooking the dance floor and stage, and you can get a kick outta people watching when the band starts playing.	2
This place was very good with excellent food and service.  The owner himself checked on us and he was very nice.  We would highly recommend.	3
It was pretty good. We had the calamari which was excellent. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, it was good.	3
These guys are great. A little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native East Coast (that have delis inside) . These guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around IMO. The ingredients they use are top notch. Very tasty, very clean. Diamond in the rough.	3
Yum! While staying at the hotel we had dessert which was super yummy lemon tart and brownie and lemon tart! The next morning we went and had breakfast the people were very friendly! My husband got the breakfast burrito and I go the eggs and toast w/ refried beans. They make there our salas which is ver flavorful for sure!!	3
Burger \u00e0 composer soi m\u00eame, le mien (avec un patty de dinde) \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bon! Les frites aussi, j'ai go\u00fbt\u00e9 les classiques et celles de patate douce.	3
I went here with a family group after my brother's graduation. It should be mentioned that everyone ordered vegetarian items, and no one was disappointed, even my fussy grandparents.\n\nThe waiter was a jokester, and I found his excessively corny humor endearing.\n\nMy dish (family bean curd) was tasty, and I was pleased to learn that, for once, a restaurant had indulged me when I asked to turn the spice all the way up. My friend got the Vegetable Lo Mein. There were fewer vegetables than she typically prefers, but we both thought the sauce was superb. I also tried several other dishes and was not disappointed. It was definitely a nice experience.\n\nThe one negative I can think of was that the floor in the area we were seated was uneven. It's a minor gripe, and may have stood out more to me due to the cramped seating (as the whole fam was crowded around the table)	3
"Generally places that try to do too much (fusion) fail or come up short at any one thing. Here we have regular Japanese menu, hibachi, extensive sushi menu, and extensive Chinese food menu yet from what we have sampled everything was delicious. We tried two sushi rolls (sushi rolls are named and almost identical to those at Sushi Bay... odd) Paradise roll and Valley of Fire roll... both delicious and what we expected. The calamari tempura appetizer was just okay...compared to Sushi Mon's it failed miserably. We also shared an entree of General Tso's Chicken and that was fresh and delicious... pretty standard higher quality Americanized Chinese food. \n\nThe service was okay...we had three different servers and one of them annoyed me briefly. I asked for a Sapporo and she said \""Let me see your ID\"" ...so basically demanded it instead of asking to see my ID. What the hell? But, everyone else was nice, the food reasonably priced for the quality and portion and it was a cute little place. I would come back to try more of their dishes."	3
First time trying this place out...ordered the Aloha Chicken! :-) The food was pretty good...although I have had macaroni salad from a Hawaiian place out of state that I liked better, but can't complain for this being right up the road! The meat was very tasty and flavorful!	3
Good music and a good crowd.	4
People think I'm crazy when I say PPP is my favorite pizza. No lie... I love this place! Cheap and delicious.	4
Great place!! Very clean and professional!  Prices are reasonable and lots of options.	4
"This \""IS\"" the best damn steak / seafood  place that I have found in a loooong time!!!!  A little on the pricey side but hey, what place isn't here in Vegas??  You want a steak that will melt in your mouth??  Try this place.. If you like a good stiff drink try the Mortini. It's Mortons most famous signature drink.   It will blow you away!!!!  One will do ya just fine, two will probaby put you to sleep or la la land!!!!!!!!!  haha  Enjoy."	4
For the past year I have been living in Las Vegas I have suffered from serve authentic Mexican foot withdrawals...then finally my savior came in the form of a gran taco. Taco Taco ahh where to I start? The taco bar?? Loaded with spicy carrots, cucumbers, all types of salsa and even beans, you can have full meal from that alone! I go to Taco Taco about twice a week and I have gotten the Gran Tacos pretty much every time, the Al Pastor is out of this world no more of this Robertos BS!. I really happy this place isn't too close to my residence or I would be there every day!. Staff is friendly even was treated to free tacos on time. Soccer on the TV, great tunes bumpin on the stereo good vibes all around hard to beat this place!	4
This place was fantastic and the service was fabulous! I had the tomato gin soup, which is one of their house specialty. I almost locked my bowl clean. Our group had the mahi mahi, the soy-citrus salmon, the perfectly grilled salmon, and he balsamic ribeye. Everything was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious! The white chocolate brownie was mouth wetting and a great finish to the meal. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us with our decisions and what to order. His recommendations on food and beverages was perfect!	4
"OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH YEAH! \n\nLove me some Roose! \n\nPronounced \""Ruse\"" but it's just off of Roosevelt. Pretty cute huh? \n\nAJ is the stylist. LeAnne takes care of your skin and non-top of the head hair. \n\nAJ, who's been cutting my hair for a couple years, is incredible. Each year one stylist from OUR WHOLE WONDERFUL COUNTRY is chosen to represent THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA in an huge hair show in France. A couple years ago, AJ was that person. She's really quite talented. Like Edward Scissor hands, but female and not sporting severe social anxiety disorder. And her skin is radiant and not ghostly white. And her hair is not jet black. Ohh, and her hands are not knives! But other than that, she's exactly like Edward Scissor hands, sculpting works of art out of shapeless masses. \n\nI have not had the pleasure of LeAnne's services yet but she's uber professional. I'm quite satisfied to believe that when she waxes the hair eloquently away from your skin it will hurt less than when others do it. \n\nGo here. Live it. Love it. It's the real dealio..."	4
My wife, friends and I went to MOzen for brunch and had a great time.  The food was great and the service is friendly and efficient without getting in the way of the conversation.	4

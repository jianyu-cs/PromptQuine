The service and price are fine.  We are very disappointed with the food.  Fried rice is the best dish that we had.  Way too much batter on calamari.  Shrimp tempura was very fishy.   Most importantly, the sushi was not fresh, you can see it by the color of the fish.  I really would not recommend this place to anyone.	0
The wait staff was nice. I ordered a burger that came with a moldy bun. When I told the waitress the cook only sent me a fresh bun rather than remaking the burger. I refused to eat it a got a hassle when I told them I wasnt going to pay. On the way out I peeked in the kitchen. It was dirty. Not just new dirt but nasty buildup around the grill and fryers.	0
waaaay too crowded and absurdly expensive drinks. security inside would not let us stand for one second, made us keep walking back and forth. the dance floor was a mosh pit and was not fun. I got separated from my friends and only stayed for an hour	0
If you tell someone 20 min for food to be ready there is no reason it should take an hour for it to be ready. Some people have kids to feed and they can't be wasting an hour sitting in your lobby listening to your workers talk about their eyebrows needing to get done. I am a manager where I work and if I ever caught my crew on their phone and talking in front of an unhappy customer they would be sent home for the night seems how they don't want to be there as it is. As I made it clear I was unhappy did I see the manager... No... Only the young girls taking the orders who have no clue what customer service is. It takes more then hiring an employee to make them valuable. This establishment needs training across the board.	0
I sigh as a write this....we went for food. It wasn't very good. It wasn't bad, just boring, overpriced, and salty. I suppose the name of the restaurant should've been an indicator.\n\nThe pina colada was meh.\n\nI wished I was either at a dive Mexican restaurant or somewhere like El Zocalo. Anywhere would've been better really.\n\nIt was irritating paying over forty dollars for two people for such a disappointing meal.  Next time I'll check Yelp first.	0
Yuk. Dirty and gross	0
"If I can give this location a negative rating I would. I was young and naive and they took full advantage of that. I went in looking for a car and the staff there was more than willing to help me. I told him what my price range was and he showed me which cars would fit my needs. I went for the 2005 Mitsubishi Galant and told the guy I would come back when I received my check. When I did come back all of a sudden the amount previously agreed upon was changed and so were the payments but I needed a care ASAP so I agreed and paid. I was told they would put gas in the car then the day of I realized there was no gas in the car. The car didn't have a stereo and when I mentioned this they gave me one that didn't match what was suppose to be in the car. My car broke down MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE FREEWAY. All 4 tires blew out on the freeway as well which was later discovered that they put retreaded tires on the car. They somehow \""lost\"" a payment and when I spoke to the manager he said he would waive the next payment WELL THAT WAS A LIE. When I went back up there they told me I was 2 payments behind (because of the so called lost payment and the lie the manager fed me to get me out the damn place). Luckily I had proof the \""lost\"" payment was actually given to them since I had my receipts in the car for EVERY PAYMENT that was provided from them. I was so fed up I ended up basically sitting in the dealership with my family refusing to leave telling everyone that came in what they were really all about... literally every person turned around and did not make a purchase and obviously they kicked us out so I called the police on them (which apparently is a normal thing at this location according to the police officer). He made sure I didn't have to pay the next payment but after dealing with them for months and having constant problems with the staff and the car I just let them repossess the car... The cost to fix it would've been more than the actual value of the car. Never go here they will lie and manipulate the situation at any cost."	0
"Let's see....where to begin. There was so much wrong that my head is still spinning. \n\nA group of us went here last night for a friends 40th birthday. Being 7 o'clock Saturday night, we expected the place to be slammed, but it wasn't, with several tables empty.\n\nLet's being with the service. Terrible; nonexistent. The 6 of us were sat in a section the same time another party of 12 sat. Our drink order was taken fairly quickly. Nothing difficult, waters and iced tea. After about 10 minutes we realized that we hadn't received our drinks, despite 5 staff members standing behind the hostess counter, not 10 feet away, shooting the shit and looking at their phones. We finally went to speak to the manager that if they were going to give this one waitress 2 large parties at the same time, that perhaps someone should give her some help running food and drinks. Despite this, another 5 minutes went by before we saw our drinks. Our order was taken and we began waiting for our food. And we waited, and waited, and waited some more. About 30 minutes, with empty glasses at our tables only filled once. At about the 20 minute mark, the manager stopped by and said our food should be out shortly. I guess 10 minutes is short time. Mind you, still 3 or 4 staff standing idly at the hostess stand. We were there about 2 hours for a meal that should have taken about an hour because of a staff that doesn't give two shits about providing good, prompt service. In fact a woman at the table of 12 complained to another manager and supervisor that was on duty, and as they passed by our table afterwards the supervisor was heard saying, \""How about the attitude on that bitch.\"" NOT GOOD, SADDLE RANCH.\n\nAnd now the food. Ugh. Let's set the stage with what we ordered. Extra thick pork chop with bourbon glaze, baseball sirloin (rare), 2 prime rib (rare, and medium rare), and 2 kids meals. So the food comes out and we dig in. The sirloin came out on point, but was told it was nothing special, with little flavor. The prime ribs were another story. The rare came out medium and the medium rare came out medium well. Naturally we pointed it out and they took them back to the kitchen to fetch the correct cooked items. The manager comes back and says that they had run out of medium rares and that the rare cut that came out was in fact the last rare cut of the night, so naturally it cooked though to medium. Why the didn't tell us this at the time of placing the order is beyond all of us at this point, now that we are nearly an hour into our sitting; so we just dug through the ones that were available. The extra thick chop was about an inch thick. A thick cut should be moist. This was quite possibly the driest chop I've ever had and the glaze was flat and flavorless. All came with veggies and a side. My chop came with about half the portions that the prime ribs received. \n\nI will give the manager a little bit of credit as she brought out 2 deserts and comped one of the prime ribs. This actually saved them from getting zero stars, but it was far little too late. In the 2 hours we were there, our glasses only got filled 3 times. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER AGAIN. This was by far, hands down, the poorest display of service I have ever experienced at an eating establishment."	0
We picked out desserts - purple taro cake, black forest cake, egg custard and cappuccino mousse.  It is hard to believe but over the course of the following several days we shared each one and all were unexceptional.	0
We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fianc\u00e9 says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again	0
Worst dim sum ever... Open at 11 but no baked buns till noon. Fishy shrimp har gow....   The list goes on. Get me outa here now!	0
"Rao's is in a fairly nice location in Caesar's Palace--it's located in between casinos, and it has indoor (inside the restaurant), and \""outdoor\"" (overlooking the walkways between casinos) seating.  We were looking for a quick place to have lunch, and this place was right in our way.\n\nThe waitstaff was very nice and very polite to us.  Water was regularly refilled, and freebees were ample, like bread and olive oil.  The table and linens were clean.\n\nThere was a very limited selection of wine--a definite no-no in the world of Italian dining.  Both wine and beer are overpriced, but that is part of being in Las Vegas.  \n\nPizzas were about 8 to 10 inches--all were personal pizzas.  The size wasn't so much the issue as was how they were dressed.  In other restaurants, their pizzas would have been classified as appetizers rather than entrees.  \n\nMy biggest complaint has to do with the meatball entree.  For lunch, this included 1 large meatball, but it didn't come with anything at all--no pasta, no salad, no bread, nothing.  WHO orders a meatball and NOTHING ELSE?  What was worse was the sneaky way the server tacked on what was less than a half-order of pasta to make it a meal...for an extra $13!  I actually don't think the meatball may have cost that much.\n\nIn a place like Las Vegas, famous for gourmet all-you-can-eat buffets, Rao's is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.  Small portions, service that deliberately did not disclose information about the menu, and a much larger than warranted bill at the end of the experience was enough to keep me searching for a better deal and better food."	0

"I have enjoyed this restaurant in the past but I will NEVER step foot there again.   For several weeks now I have been planning a fieldtrip for my class so that they could taste some of their food.   I've been hyping it up all week to my students and I made my reservation long ago.   They asked me to come by a day or two before to give them the final numbers.   When I came in to do that, I spoke to the owner and the chef and they said \""we feel bad but we can not accommodate you!\""   They said that they had no record of my reservation and that I didn't speak to the right person.   I called their reservation number and they transferred me to the person who actually makes reservations, that is their fault, who else did I have to speak to?   I can't believe that they are so disorganized.   Anyway, so then I asked to see the reservations they had for the day I asked and voil\u00e0!   There I was my name plus 20 people !   What shocked me next is that they still refused to accommodate us!   It is really outlandish that they would take a reservation for a school and have me and my administration go trough hoops and hurdles to have this fieldtrip approved, fill out paperwork, get 2 substitute teachers, get and submit permission slips to then just cancel it without notice the night before !   To do this to me is one thing but to do it to our children who have been looking forward to this reward for weeks is unspeakable!!!   What kind of horrible example are we giving to our children, that it is okay not to keep your word?!"	0
I went to this location on the way home from work to see if they could help me with my email set up and a leather case i just bought 4 weeks prior.  As I was talking about the case that fell apart and kept dropping my phone the counter person said there is no warranty on leather cases and nothing they could do , i asked just make me a deal on another one and they said no again.  Out of the blue a homosexual man and his partner next to me started yelling at me and saying I was an asshole? Wow this place is a trip poor service and idiots inside.  This is a cooperate store and they really don't give a shit about their customers.  They never even helped me with my email either.  I then went to the location on greenfield and mckellips not a cooperate store with errogant assholes and they helped me problem solved.	0
This was our second visit to Baby Stacks, our first visit wasn't great, but we always like to give second chances.  BIG mistake.  Same problems, party of five, three got breakfast, than after some time the other two got part of their breakfast, then later the cold toast arrived and after asking twice  your jam arrived.  We wanted to have breakfast together at the same time.  It was not busy.  Don't know if it was waiter or kitchen, but is was not an enjoyable breakfast.  The FRIED eggs were wet with water, icky and the food was average.  So if service is important to you I would pass on BabyStacks.	0
First off, I would've gave this place 4 stars because the food was fantastic. \nSadly, the service was not!\n\nWe sat ourselves and had to wave the waitress down for some waters. \nAlso waited 15 mins for our bill & she took so long to even pick up the bill that I, finally just walked up to cashier to pay. \nI get that she's alone and it just opened but c'mon management...\n\n\nImmediately ordered the soup dumplings (unsure of the Chinese name) because this is the only place my friends know of that has this. Got the steamed and pan fried ones.\n\nWhen we got the steamed ones, I had to ask my friends how to even eat it if there's hot soup in the dumplings. \nThey said to eat/bite the top of the dumplings, let it steam out, and add the sauce. \nThat itself was really fun for me. I mean, who doesn't like playing with their food =)\n\nThe soup in the dumplings were delicious and savory. Tasted amazing with the dough! Pan fried/seared dumplings were my favorite of the two.\n\nAlso, ordered the onion pancake, I believe...I think that was the name.....?\nAnd THAT was sooooooo YUM. Crunchy and tasty, like sour cream and onion chips...if I had to compare it to something....\n\nAfter this experience and bad service, we'd love to try more soup dumplings so, we yelped it... Found a couple places thru Yelp! \nOtherwise, this place is our last resort because of the lacking service!	1
Come here if you want terrible service. Food is decent but the service and quality of people working here is ridiculous.	1
"One of my close friends has been raving about this place since it opened. Being one of those \""I support local businesses\"" people and having 15 minutes to spare this morning I decided to finally try it out.\n\nI am not a coffee snob by any means. I just want a vanilla soy latte that tastes good. I want it to taste like a vanilla soy latte. The one I got this morning from Holley's Cuppa tasted like a mocha latte. And, it wasn't hot at all. Warm at best. I only drank half of it before I just gave up and threw it away.\n\nI also ordered the sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. It was ok. Nothing special. Definitely something I could easily make at home. \n\nThe service was ok. I went through the drive thru and I could see there were several customers inside as well so they were buy.\n\nI will give them another try most likely. Hopefully it will be better next time."	1
Last time I was here about 4 months ago everything was fine and decent. You really can't go wrong with fried shrimp. \n\nGirlfriend got the lobster tail which was ok but seemed alittle over cooked but with more butter it wasnt as bad. But as the dinner was about to end I found the most grossest pubic look hair under a popcorn shrimp. I almost threw up. The waiter was very helpful and he removed my item from the bill and the manager apologized which I didn't ask for. \n\nSo customer was good there. 1 star for that and another for the yummy biscuits. I also still tipped what the original amount would have been because the server was pretty awesome. \n\nBut I have to say this is my last time to red lobster. Not cuz of the hair but because of the mediocre food.	1
After 5 years in Phoenix and so much anticipation of trying Coronado Cafe, I was extremely underwhelmed. Nothing was bad. Nothing was stellar. I didn't hate my meal, but was more perplexed by raving reviews after such a mediocre experience.\n\nWe kicked off our dinner with the infamous crab cakes which were delicious no doubt. That's where the enthusiasm ended. Having enjoyed them so much I decided to order the crab soup of the day which had a tomato and vegetable base and threw in a half Greek salad for good measure. My other half got the cheese burger. The soup tasted old and had no special quality to it with mushy veggies and completely pulled apart crab strings that made this like a tortilla soup without the spice. The salad was served on basic yellow romaine with no distinguishing qualities that set it apart from Souper Salad or Olive Garden.  For $11, I can't say I was thrilled. My beau's burger charted the same on his satisfaction scale - nothing to write home about.\n\nThe people were very sweet and the ambiance was cozy, but the ambiance was also...quiet. Very quiet, like empty quiet.  Perhaps brunch is bustling on weekends and the different menu poses more potential. But we won't be back for dinner.	1
I've been here a bunch of times already.  Salty's is a great place if you're looking for a good drink and a place to socialize outdoors.  That's what keeps us coming back.  Although the happy hours are decent, I wouldn't say the same for the food. Seems like it can all be easily prepared in the microwave. The only thing I've tried there that I would actually get again is the guac, but it's also something I can just make at home...\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a good time, good drinks, good atmosphere and a fun time (esp. at night when there's a band or DJ), Salty's is a great place to go.  They also have a volleyball court and an area for bags (aka cornhole) and horseshoes, which is unique.\n\nThe two star rating would be higher if the drink specials were phenomenal, but they're not.  The food knocks down my opinion as well.	1
"The Good:\nSO and I both ordered Unagi bowls. The unagi itself was good, and that's the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one. \nThe Bad:\nThe veggies served with it were not great, and it did not come with miso soup, unlike all of their other \""bowls\"". Also, it took an extremely long time to receive our relatively simple meals, around fifteen-twenty minutes. This was because he completely forgot about us and only remembered when my SO went up and to ask about the food. Moreover, he and I watched as the worker (probably also the manager) argued with a customer, saying that she had already received her food, when it was clear it was a different girl who happened to order the same item. \n\nOverall, would not return, especially with Sushi Ichiban so close, and with more reasonable prices."	1
Are you stalking me?  Heres a hint: I'm not at Myst.  Ever.\n\nThe crowd is too young (think ASU's entire Greek scene), too wasted (think puke-your-face-off drunk) and too retarded (think OHMYGOD we SO just got into a club and were only NINTEEN!!).  \n\nI freaking hate this clucterfuck.  \n\nHouse music is not my thing, watching underage girls snort coke in the bathroom is not my thing, and fighting through people who are under the false impression that they are cooler than me is not my thing.  \n\nThey have world-renowned DJs in there every once in a while and a pretty decent chance of celebrity sightings which brings Myst to a whopping 2 stars.	1
"I used to love Cork, and I've wanted to continue to love it, but the last vew visits have demonstrated a massive decline in the level of service.\n\nI've been probably 6 or 8 times in the past year, and only half the time did we receive the quality of service that I felt thier price point warranted.\n\nMost recently, I took a new friend there for brunch for the first time. By the end of the meal we were both in a terrible mood, our waitress had sucked so bad. Examples:\n\n* After sitting down, it took the waitress a full 15 minutes before taking our order. It took another full half hour for the food to arrive! Yes, they were busy, but there were empty tables too. Other people who arrived after us had their orders taken quickly (they had the best waiter there) and were already paying thier tab & leaving at the time our food arrived. \n* My date had to ask 3 times for cream & sweetener for his coffee: it finally arrived 15 minutes later. When the coffee was cold. (Glad I drink mine black!)\n* Our food arrived cold.\n* He ordered wheat toast w/his meal. The waitress didn't bring the toast until he was nearly done eating, and when plopping it down - white toast - simply stated \""We're out of wheat\"", then split. \n* I ordered a biscuit w/my meal. It was tooth-breakingly hard, like a hockey puck.\n* The waiters typically offer freshly ground pepper; this waitress did not. In fact she brought no condiments at all to the table - no butter, jelly, nothing.. When we asked for salt and pepper, she simply plopped a salt shaker - no pepper - on the table and hurried away. \n\nBecause I have been there many times and the manager recognizes me, I spoke to him about the service. Before I could even say much of anything; he immediately launched into, \""I know the service could have been better, we're having an off day, a few people called in sick, we're short-handed, blah blah blah\"" It was all a big whine of excuses. You know what, their being shortstaffed didn't cause our waitress to be shitty, her attitude did. And if they were truly shorthanded then why wasn't his lazy ass helping out? All I saw him doing through our entire meal-ordeal was leaning on the bar & yukking it up w/other workers who also didn't seem to have much to do. \n\nThankfully, most of their food continues to be delicious, that's a plus. And if you get their very best waiter (wish I remembered his name; he's worked there since day 1), then it's an awesome dining experience.\n\nI live walking distance, so I'll likely return at some point, but for folks who live a ways away, might as well steer clear."	1
I like to judge a chinese restaurant by their shrimp fried rice.  It tells me how good their chef is with flavor, how fresh the ingredients are since it is seafood, and how powerful the wok is to get that nice finish for the fried rice.\n\nThe shrimp was mushy and old, the rice was not flavorful.  Second time I've come here.  I was not impressed the first time around, and definitely not impressed this time when I tried to give it another chance.  Too bad, damn...	1
There were 12 of us that ate at this crowded and cramped place, with stinky overflowing restrooms in Las Vegas. \nThe food was delicious. Some dishes could be less greased with butter, but overall the food was good in comparison to mid-range Indian restaurants in the US - although it was priced higher than most in its range. \nThe wait was long as there are few tables to seat. Restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners. A common problem with most Indian restaurants like this one. If the food is good, the price is high - but no funds are diverted to keeping the restaurant clean for a clean experience. Where does all the cash go - not to the poor low-cost undocumented workers ????	1
Casino review (not hotel/rooms) -- the dealers at this casino are some of the most uptight who won't indulge in conversation, won't even smile, in fact, we kept getting ID'ed even though we were much older which got really annoying..	1
Went here for the first time with a gift certificate that I received for my birthday. The people at the front desk were so nice and got me green tea asi was directed to the manicure station. The girl doing my nails was nice and personable, but stopped a few times to talk to other employees in the middle of the service. I personally want my cuticles clipped and I like to see that they have taken the dry skin off. It's a pet peeve when they don't. Heads up, they don't clip the cuticle at all. After the manicure was done, while my nails looked pretty,it felt like I just had a polish change. \nNow on to the pedicure..pretty decor and comfy tufted chairs. ( in my opinion the atmosphere of this place is so much better then the service you are receiving.) no massage in chairs, no jets in the bowl, no cuticle remover put on my feet. They were soaked for maybe 30 seconds before she took maybe a few small cuticles off and trust me they needed a lot of work. Massage was great but lasted about 20 seconds per foot. And that is being generous. Paid extra for callus remover and still had dry feet when I left. When I went to check out the total was 60 dollars! Are you serious?! I will stick to my trusty nail salon any day over this over priced frou frou nail bar. Also if you want to indulge.. Go to DryBar and have a blowout next door...so much better.	1
"Really hate to do it- but last night was pretty awful here. On any normal day you seem to get by with the average slip here or two, which is always amended right away, but this really took the cake. \n\nGlass night- Monty Python goblet. Knew what kind of turn out they were going to have so we made it a point to get there 30mins early. Even with getting there this early, we literally only had one table in the back open. Packed house. \n\nOur waitress, Amanda, came over and took our order right away for the glasses. We had no reason to believe we wouldn't get them as it was roughly 6:40 at this point. Right at 7, glasses were given out to a few tables around us. We sat. And sat. And sat. Finally she came out to tell us we wouldn't be getting ours due to the fact they had only received half the shipment. I'll circle back to this later.\n\nShe also said the manager would come out and speak with us and that we had a free beer on them. Well long story short the manager never came to speak with us and the free beer was only limited to house brews, so if you were trying to pick away at your UFO club with 100+ brews tasted already, that didn't sound like it was happening either.\n\nThe thing that REALLY aggravated me was that the manager, who I didn't know until she was pointed out last night, came around to 5 other tables in the back area and apologized for the mishap. Every table BUT ours! She walked back up front and never came back!\n\nThe entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place. If what was told to us was true, Amanda did a good job of handling herself, I'm sure that night was a mess for any waitress. As far as management is concerned, yeah, I am still pretty pissed off.\n\nAnd as per the glasses, which is whatever really, when you know your frequent customers see them out on the shelves on Monday, I would use a better excuse than \""we didn't know we only had half the shipment\"", that is just pretty lame. Not to mention who doesn't inventory when they initially receive items??"	1
I love Hot wings.  love love love hotwings, and although I AM a chick - I still dig going to Hooters, and from what I've learned there is a HUGE HUGE difference between locations for quality of food.\n\nThis one is at the low end of my rating scale - although our server Tiffany was one of the nicest and most knowledgable of servers we have had yet in any of the locations.\n\nThe wings (911 and 3mile) 's sauce was almost gritty like sand in texture and the celery was limp.  The battered shrimp were rather soggy too (as if they were not frozen all the way thru prior to cooking)\n\nNot a great one, but from what I learned not a francise - one of the 'staple' locations. Which makes me wonder - which has better food, the chicken or the egg?	1
I used to love this place-authentic Mexican food. No more. Bad service and poor quality ingredients.	1
I prefer to go to local coffee shops and support them rather than go to Starbucks. My only issue with this Starbucks is that the staff aren't very friendly rather you're going through the drive-thru or going inside. This one was right next to my house so I would stop in purely based on convenience but if I had time I'd go somewhere else for sure.	2
"I miss the Tommy Pastrami's that was in this location, but my Carne Asada Fries are biking distance now. So, not much of a loss. \nI notice very little deviance from the other Roberto's locations, which means this is \""the\"" taco shop with a duplicate-able sense of business.\n \nThis particular location does offer green onions in the salsa bar, which is a plus, but while self-serve salsa bars seems to be a trend in Mexican cuisine, I would not trust the area with these gringos. Remember, these are the same guys that taught terrorists to fly but not land, and why Las Vegas businesses have such a false sense of security. So, if they can't police their own safety, what makes you think they can handle a salsa bar. I've posted similar concerns with U-Swirl and Yogurtland. Self serve areas in food service is a foolish idea, especially in a fast food atmosphere.\n\nNonetheless, I come here for machaca, chorizo, and breakfast burritos. This is also my place for quesadillas and horchata; perfect amount of cinnamon. I do wish they had tacos de cabeza. The only location I remember seeing this was at Maryland near UNLV. \n\nI dine out a lot over the past 30+ years, and I only got sick at Jack-in-the-box (twice) and Burger King once. So, this place is the cleanest of its kind, and the service is also really fast. \n\nI think I'll go there now.\n\n_______________________________________-____-_____\nWell, I just came back from there, and I was slightly peeved. \nThe salsa bar was amazingly messier than any time I've ever seen it, and it was only 9:30 in the morning. \nI ordered my regular carne asada fries but I wasn't in the mood to eat a whole order, and since they only have one size, I asked them to put it into 2 separate smaller containers instead. She said they could not do that for me. But she was able to give me 2 empty small containers along with my regular order.  The adjustment is very small and would take only 10 seconds to split the ingredients into 2 smaller containers. That kind of inflexibility shows me some inexperience with the cooks.\nThe service was still fast, but what was once a 4 star place has dropped one whole star because they could not accommodate such a minor request.\nI went home and took a spatula and split it myself. It took 5 seconds, but the ingredients did not adhere like the original prepared presentation. If they did it I would be happy. But like most businesses in the US, it's not their job to make me happy- nor is it my job to tip them."	2
I must say I loved the food. Just didn't like the after effects.\nwent with a group of 4. all samples the shrimp dumplins, Edamame dumplins, tasted the sashimi salad, I ordered the Sea Bass Street tacos.\nAll was tasty - Sea bass slightly over cooked. Service was weak at the start and ok at the end. The highlight was the Edamame dumplings...but I've got to tell you...I have paid for it ever since. 3 of the 4 people had stomach issues and it isn't pretty if you know what I mean. Now 24 hours after and I still am on the pot...healthy food certainly cleans you out.	2
I'd like to preface this by saying I really do like Z'Tejas.  The food is always good, and the service is usually spot on.  The problem I have with this particular location is the hostess(es), and their amazing ability to lose reservations.  On more than one ocassion, I've showed up only to find they have no record of my reservation.  They always look confused and ask me if I was sure I called the right location.  My favorite was when they wanted to know if I put it under the wrong name.  I'm sure I forget my own name all the time.  Awww.....it's ok, hostess(es), at least you're pretty.	2
Have you seen the Holiday? You know that cute English/LA Christmas movie with Kate Winslet, Jack Black, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law? This Irish pub is that lovely pub. Super cozy, one of those places that everyone knows your name.\n\nNestled a few minutes away from Villa-Maria metro and right in NDG, this place was a beacon from Montreal's chilly weather. The moment we sat down and took our jackets, tuques, scarves and mitts off I immediately felt comfortable and the pints - Newcastles, Griffin's, Guinness' came. \n\nI had fish and chips (yum!) and my friends had cheeseburgers and fries (yum!!). \nWish this place was round the corner from my place... I'd be a regular.\n\nLocal tip - this Irish pub menu has Sir Lankan curries; kitchen staff are Sri Lankan and the curries were highly recommended by friend and local NDGer.\n\nYou can find them on twitter @YOOPub	2
"This is BY FAR the best buffet I've been to downtown.  The Golden Nugget's buffet is poison.  My wife actually broke out with some crazy rash after eating there. Fremont Casino's \""Paradise\"" buffet is more like a paradise for heat lamps although I can't totally hate on that one only for the \""Swingers\"" movie factor.  The servers must be sick of patrons ordering the age of enlightenment there.\n\nBack to the subject at hand.  I got a buy one, get one free coupon so this was a great motivator to finally go.  I know the champagne brunch is everyone's highlight but there's no way I'm ever at Fremont that early unless I'm still there from the night before.\n\nMost buffets don't do much as far as atmosphere but I dug the old school vibe.  The place felt very welcoming with how well lit and clean everything looked.  We didn't have lunch that day so we opted for dinner at the senior citizenesque time of 4:30pm.  Lo and behold there was already a line full of seniors but it wasn't a long wait at all.    \n\nIt was T-bone steak night which was fine.  Standard $6 breakfast type t-bones but I tore though two of them so no complaints here!  I was most impressed with the southern/soul food.  Fried chicken, yams and collard greens were all solid.  Everything else ranged between average or a little above but that's amazing compared to most downtown buffet joints.  \n\nIt's hard to pull me away from the Triple 7 Brewery if we're dining around here but I'd be willing to come here again with a coupon."	2
Food was excellent as was the setting. I had super service till after the entree and then the waiter never returned. It was such an abrupt contrast to the attentiveness I had received that I'm rating a 3 star. No one asked about coffee and I waited  forever to get my check.	2
Servers are very polite but chips are stale, salsa has great taste though. Carnitas are very tender and portions are suitable. Place is kind of small and cramped.	2
Here's the thing...you definitely get what you pay for. We stayed there literally overnight so it was a very quick stay. It was a great deal at $60 for the night which included parking and a quick continental breakfast in the am. \n\nThe hotel's interior looks more like a dorm than a hotel. The rooms are....fine. Some of the pillowcases and bedding was questionable but we kept telling ourselves it's just one night. \n\nThe biggest problem was THE SMELL. We were in a non smoking room but this room had a unique funk all it's own. It was not good. Oh and our room had a view of the pool which we realized had no water in it and had two deck chairs turned over just chilling at the bottom of it *shrug*\n\nBut the staff was super friendly and cheerful and they had some great options for their continental breakfast. Plus we scored great parking outside the front entrance. \n\nSo I probably won't go back there again, but like i said, you get what you pay for. ;)	2
Okay -- I will admit this this place was going to be a hard sell for me. I am not a huge ramen fan but the idea of a campus ramen restaurant has always intrigued me. I took my daughter, a big Doodles fan, to lunch today. She got her usual Pad Thai Doodle with bean sprouts and mushrooms and I got the Coconut Tom Doodle with fishballs. Thank goodness that we got in when we did since we were followed by a group of around a dozen people.\n\nI thought my soup was fine and I know my daughter enjoyed hers, as well as the four berry smoothie she received.\n\nNegatives: They seemed be be out of ingredients for a few of the drinks and the place had  musty smell to it.\n\nSo ... I thought Doodles was okay, but not the kind of place I would go to again. But for a college student looking to get a quick, hot lunch on the cheap, I can see why this place would be very attractive.	2
Again like the Luxor, it's undergone and still undergoing some major renovations. I don't know what the rooms look like, but the front desk and some of the gaming area has been newly redone.  And it looks pretty nice, it's no Cosomo nice, but it's no Harrah's bad.\n\nThey are also adding a Bagatelle, which we've all been waiting with baited breath to see how this changes the Nikki Beach debacle that occurred there previously.  This place is infamous for crazy brunches in NYC [Google it] I think it's supposed to open at the end of the month.  But definitely missed pool season on this one.\n\nSports book was a lot nicer than I envisioned too, albeit it was subarctic temperatures in there.  The hole casino smells like that carpet Vanilla powder that your mom used to put down before she vacuumed in the 80's, maybe it's just me. But it smells very strongly of vanilla covering up booze and cigs, in other words, not that great.	2
Not as many samples as my old whole foods back home. Don't feel like I've ate my fill after shopping. Not 'merica enough for me haha.\n\nIt does have a hipster watering hole, as in a bar with all of their favorite brews on tap and beards, beards everywhere. There is also a cute little eat-in spot by the cafe which wont kill your budget.\n\nIt's expensive, as usual, but does have all of the organic, vegan, and gluten-free products that we have come to expect from whole foods.	2
I enjoy the food here. Straightforward concept like Chipotle and the like. I am a big fan of the nachos here. The three cheese sauce is delicious and has a little spice. I enjoy the salsa here, always seemed fresher than competitors. The burritos are pretty standard, and always consistent. My only real concern is that on veggie nachos or veggie burritos you have to pay more for fajita veggies or rice (only on nachos). Seriously? I am already not getting meat, which means that it is already cheaper to make. Other than that, this place will stay on rotation. \nThis Qdoba is always very clean, not really too busy, and the service is typically pretty decent.	2
"I have been putting this review off for a while because I was uncertain how to put pen to paper, but I can't procrastinate any longer.  I am going to treat this review much like a work related evaluation and utilize the \""compliment sandwich\"".  So here it goes.\n\nA great shout out to Rachel C, our CM for organizing the event and the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust for supplying our tickets to the show.  It was great finally being able to meet Rachel and the generosity of the PCT was phenomenal.  I will never turn down an opportunity to view any event at the beautiful historic Benedum Center.  Again many thanks!\n\nNow as far as the \""musical\"" goes I will point out as others have, this was originally written as an opera.  I am not a fan of operatic singing and though I liked several of the songs the switching back and forth from operatic signing to more main stream musical was not pleasing to my ears.  I barely could understand the words when they were belted out in this format.  The storyline was ok, however it had several racist undertones depicting African American's during this time period as fighting, gambling, drinking, drug abusing criminals.  The story was also at times hard to follow, possibly because of the manner of the singing which left me disinterested at some times.  I have seen several musicals at the Benedum and this was the most disappointing.  \n\nFurthermore, for the last piece of bread on my sandwich, I really think the actors did a great job.  I may not be a huge fan of this work, but I think the cast was top notch, and acting and dancing were entertaining.  And as always any event at the Benedum is worth going to as 9 times out of 10 the experience is splendid."	2
They seem to move things around... a lot. Seriously, it seems like every time I come here the sections have been moved. They have an awesome selection on crafts and arts, from beads, to yarns, art paper, scrapbooking, framing, and pretty much any home craft your inner artist wants. The downside is they are pretty pricey, and service isn't always great. Everytime I have shopped here there seems to be only one or two cashiers on duty, when they have about six registers, and there is always a long line. Plus, you seriously have to go hunt down an employee to get help. How bad is this hunting process? They have buttons in the store for you to push to get an employee to crawl out of whatever dark corner they have decided to sleep in. I once walked through the entire store and did not find ONE person, but I did see three people in a back room standing around a craft table looking at crafts they had made. Oh yeah, didn't know that they make things and sell them here did ya? They do. They make everything from painted foam pumpkins to simple wreaths. And how much, pray tell is this stuff? Way to much. They have a huge wreath for almost 1000$ there. Really. On sale even. Made from things you can buy there, and make yourself, for less. Or the dollar store. Whichever.	2
Not the best but definitely convenient if you're rushing or want a quick bite.  It's a also a little more pricey than it should be, but then again it is a restaurant in a Casino.  I'm a fan of the Red Dragon Roll, Cajun Albacore and the Mackerel Sashimi.  Go at the right time and grab a table overlooking the dance floor and stage, and you can get a kick outta people watching when the band starts playing.	2
Price alert! Price alert!\n\nThe famous $3.95 for a 1/2 pound steakburger with fries has been upped to $5.95!\nJust my luck that the places I decide to finally visit for the awesome prices, no longer have those prices!  From Rani's, Sage at Aria, and now this...I need to hurry and jump on the bandwagon while these places have those awesome prices.\n\nAnywho, we really enjoyed our lunch here today.  The carpet was indeed cool.  The water mill was very serene.  The smoke, not so much, but it is a lounge after all.  I want to share a quick story.  \n\nWaitress (W): What would you like to drink?\nMe (M): Is the tea freshly brewed?\nW: Yes.\nM: Is it sweetened?\nW: No.\nM: Do you have agave nectar?\nW: No, but we have sugar.\nM: Do you have mango lemonade?\nW: We have lemonade.\nM: Umm, what other drinks do you have?\nW: Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Sprite, Ginger Ale..\nM: Oh, what brand of Ginger Ale?\nW: The one that comes out of the box.\nM: I will get the Ginger Ale then.\nW: Ok, what would you like to eat?\nM: I'll have the Patty Melt with six slices of pickles.\nW: It comes with a pickle spear.\nM: I like 6 slices of pickles.\nW: Oh ok.\n\nMy bf had to remind me that this is not a typical restaurant...it's a LOUNGE!  Oops, my bad.  I honestly didn't mean to be complicated.  The food came out and they were delish!  My bf had the famous, now $5.95 burger, with a slice of American chesse ($.50) and bacon ($.75) and I had the patty melt for $6.95.  I was full off of half of that patty melt.\n\nOur bill came out shy of $20, but our waitress took our card and gave us back the change since it's their policy not to run cards for less than $20.  \n\nIn summary, we would come back.  It's pretty cool!	3
Food, excellent service... The French onion soup and Caesar salad really hit the spot. That is so exciting to eat inside, but also outside, all at the same time	3
First time trying this place out...ordered the Aloha Chicken! :-) The food was pretty good...although I have had macaroni salad from a Hawaiian place out of state that I liked better, but can't complain for this being right up the road! The meat was very tasty and flavorful!	3
This place was very good with excellent food and service.  The owner himself checked on us and he was very nice.  We would highly recommend.	3
It was pretty good. We had the calamari which was excellent. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, it was good.	3
Excellent to discover all great little dishes. Any kind, all unique.\nA place for happy hours of a nice dinner with friends. A lot of ambiance.\nWine is perfectly proposed.\nI do not have a sweet tooth, but dessert are excellent.\n\nI would go back to try appetizers again and again!	3
"B-I-N-G-O! \n\nWednesday night's @ Kennedy's is where it's at! They host free bingo and you win actual prizes (that are good too)! I went in thinking we were going to spend some loot here and left with a pocket of \""Kennedy Cash\""! Staff is great, food was good and I am especially psyched about the Triple C 3C IPA on tap!  I'll certainly be a repetative Wednesday night offender."	3
I went here with a family group after my brother's graduation. It should be mentioned that everyone ordered vegetarian items, and no one was disappointed, even my fussy grandparents.\n\nThe waiter was a jokester, and I found his excessively corny humor endearing.\n\nMy dish (family bean curd) was tasty, and I was pleased to learn that, for once, a restaurant had indulged me when I asked to turn the spice all the way up. My friend got the Vegetable Lo Mein. There were fewer vegetables than she typically prefers, but we both thought the sauce was superb. I also tried several other dishes and was not disappointed. It was definitely a nice experience.\n\nThe one negative I can think of was that the floor in the area we were seated was uneven. It's a minor gripe, and may have stood out more to me due to the cramped seating (as the whole fam was crowded around the table)	3
Burger \u00e0 composer soi m\u00eame, le mien (avec un patty de dinde) \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bon! Les frites aussi, j'ai go\u00fbt\u00e9 les classiques et celles de patate douce.	3
"Generally places that try to do too much (fusion) fail or come up short at any one thing. Here we have regular Japanese menu, hibachi, extensive sushi menu, and extensive Chinese food menu yet from what we have sampled everything was delicious. We tried two sushi rolls (sushi rolls are named and almost identical to those at Sushi Bay... odd) Paradise roll and Valley of Fire roll... both delicious and what we expected. The calamari tempura appetizer was just okay...compared to Sushi Mon's it failed miserably. We also shared an entree of General Tso's Chicken and that was fresh and delicious... pretty standard higher quality Americanized Chinese food. \n\nThe service was okay...we had three different servers and one of them annoyed me briefly. I asked for a Sapporo and she said \""Let me see your ID\"" ...so basically demanded it instead of asking to see my ID. What the hell? But, everyone else was nice, the food reasonably priced for the quality and portion and it was a cute little place. I would come back to try more of their dishes."	3
I love the idea of Luci's and I've had some great experiences here. The staff is always friendly and the lattes are great. I haven't tried the food yet but that's definitely next on my list. Unfortunately they are pretty overpriced and their iced coffee is just not my cup of tea. This morning I paid almost $8 for a small iced coffee (which I wasn't a fan of) and a decent but a little dry muffin. I would give them 3.5 stars if that was an option.	3
I've been to this place a couple of times and each time I've gotten great service from the staff. I'm not sure how they choose their people but they are always friendly and attentive.\n\nMost of the food is pretty good. Their signature burger is good but needs a little ketchup. I've also had the Grilled Chicken Panini which was ok but not great. It just seemed a little bland. The bread that they use is always really good. I love their sweet potato fries and would get it all the time if it wasn't for my expanding waistline. The best thing I've had their is their Chinese Chicken Salad. The serving size is a little ridiculous because it really is made for two people but it comes in one giant serving bowl. Despite the size, it really is delicious. It has the right amount of tang from the dressing and savoriness from the chicken that makes this carnivore skip the burgers and order the salad.\n\nThe one drawback about this place is that it's really small. The outdoor patio area is much more comfortable in terms of elbow space but you're sitting on cheap plastic chairs. Inside you'll be lucky if you're not elbow to elbow with the patron next to you.\n\nLove going to this place when the temperature is nice outside and having a convenient low-key dinner, a middle ground between fast food and fancy restaurant.	3
BBQ Chicken Pizza! Root Beer crafted in-house? Berry spritzer? \n\nI love love love their pizza and usually get the BBQ Chicken pizza (i'm a sucker for bbq)  The location is large and has ample amount of parking being in the Eastern plaza.  Great, friendly service!	3
This is for sure a hidden gem.\n\nA pretty intimate environment with great service. Perfect to disconnect or for a romantic night.\n\nThe wilted spinach salad, prepared at the table is delish. \n\nI tried the ratatouille and the portobello ravioli and both were pretty solid. \n\nThey also serve brunch on Sundays which is pretty good as well. \n\nGood wine selection and kind and friendly service.\n\nCheers	3
These guys are great. A little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native East Coast (that have delis inside) . These guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around IMO. The ingredients they use are top notch. Very tasty, very clean. Diamond in the rough.	3
Yum! While staying at the hotel we had dessert which was super yummy lemon tart and brownie and lemon tart! The next morning we went and had breakfast the people were very friendly! My husband got the breakfast burrito and I go the eggs and toast w/ refried beans. They make there our salas which is ver flavorful for sure!!	3
I am COMPLETELY impressed with the Staff at the Tropicana Hotel and GLOW SPA. The renovations of the hotel are simply gorgeous. I was a customer at the Spa on opening day 11/11/11 and had a massage with Andrew. The reception people were absolutely fantastic. The spa is GORGEOUS!. Andrew made me feel like a million bucks and Yolanda, the locker room attendant, is a beautiful and helpful person. I felt so happy and relaxed with my treatment! So relaxed that I forgot my diamond loop earrings in my locker....\nSeveral days later I realized I had forgotten them. I was literally devasted. I called the hotel immediately and spoke with Sara. To my complete relief, my earrings had been found and tucked away in the spa safe. I was thrilled! Sara was gracious, supportive and made me feel comfortable that I would receive them. To cap off my AMAZING experience, Gianni Valentino sent me my earrings in a package with a couple Mandara body wash gifts. He called me to let me know progress when the earrings were sent to me FedEx also. I am stunned, impressed and grateful for this incredible service and experience.\nI will ALWAYS stay at the Tropicana now for the rest of my life! Their impeccable service and ethics created a loyal and thankful customer.	4
Good music and a good crowd.	4
For the past year I have been living in Las Vegas I have suffered from serve authentic Mexican foot withdrawals...then finally my savior came in the form of a gran taco. Taco Taco ahh where to I start? The taco bar?? Loaded with spicy carrots, cucumbers, all types of salsa and even beans, you can have full meal from that alone! I go to Taco Taco about twice a week and I have gotten the Gran Tacos pretty much every time, the Al Pastor is out of this world no more of this Robertos BS!. I really happy this place isn't too close to my residence or I would be there every day!. Staff is friendly even was treated to free tacos on time. Soccer on the TV, great tunes bumpin on the stereo good vibes all around hard to beat this place!	4
So after the 4th visit I am still hooked.  The orange is the best!!!  I did get a cookies and cream for a friend and it received rave reviews too!!!  Seriously, I need to cut back.  Maybe I should limit myself to once or twice a week cupcake visits	4
"This \""IS\"" the best damn steak / seafood  place that I have found in a loooong time!!!!  A little on the pricey side but hey, what place isn't here in Vegas??  You want a steak that will melt in your mouth??  Try this place.. If you like a good stiff drink try the Mortini. It's Mortons most famous signature drink.   It will blow you away!!!!  One will do ya just fine, two will probaby put you to sleep or la la land!!!!!!!!!  haha  Enjoy."	4
Great place!! Very clean and professional!  Prices are reasonable and lots of options.	4
Recently worked wtih Mike Stell on an initial consultation and price estimate for a roof in bad need of repair in Mesa, Az. Wtih only this limited interaction Mike has already differentiated himself from the other roofers we consulted. He is highly professional, communicates exceptionally well and provided thoughtful and thurough answers to numerous questions that we asked. Price estimates were competitive and clear. \n\nI highly recommend working with Mike.	4
"OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH YEAH! \n\nLove me some Roose! \n\nPronounced \""Ruse\"" but it's just off of Roosevelt. Pretty cute huh? \n\nAJ is the stylist. LeAnne takes care of your skin and non-top of the head hair. \n\nAJ, who's been cutting my hair for a couple years, is incredible. Each year one stylist from OUR WHOLE WONDERFUL COUNTRY is chosen to represent THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA in an huge hair show in France. A couple years ago, AJ was that person. She's really quite talented. Like Edward Scissor hands, but female and not sporting severe social anxiety disorder. And her skin is radiant and not ghostly white. And her hair is not jet black. Ohh, and her hands are not knives! But other than that, she's exactly like Edward Scissor hands, sculpting works of art out of shapeless masses. \n\nI have not had the pleasure of LeAnne's services yet but she's uber professional. I'm quite satisfied to believe that when she waxes the hair eloquently away from your skin it will hurt less than when others do it. \n\nGo here. Live it. Love it. It's the real dealio..."	4
Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte.	4
I loved this boutique! From the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out, I and my entourage felt very welcomed! My salesgirl Jenny was phenomenal and happened to find exactly what I wanted and more. She gave me her undivided attention and I felt like I could express myself and take my time. The selection isn't as big as some places, but they carry some pretty big designers and have more unique styles. This boutique is definitely worth coming and checking out! All in all, Jenny found a dress that I didn't care for on the hanger, but ended up trying on and absolutely falling in love with it! Can't wait to get my dress :)	4
My wife, friends and I went to MOzen for brunch and had a great time.  The food was great and the service is friendly and efficient without getting in the way of the conversation.	4
And on the 8th day, god created... the bobbie. That's how awesome it is. Awesome in its taste, awe-inspiring in its simplicity. Awe-inspiring awesomeness. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo in a sub roll. So good I've had it three days in a row. \n\nMy only complaint is that it takes a while to make their sandwiches, so it's best to call ahead if you can and pick it up. It would also be cool if you could substitute mashed potatoes and gravy for the stuffing.	4
People think I'm crazy when I say PPP is my favorite pizza. No lie... I love this place! Cheap and delicious.	4
Bacchanal is, hands down, one of the best of the best when it comes to Vegas buffets.  Every time I've eaten here, I've left with an incredibly overstuffed and happy tummy.  You know that saying, quality over quantity?  Well, why not quality AND quantity!  Bacchanal has them both!\n\nThey have all types of foods...\nStarting from the front of the buffet\nSeafood: crab, oyster, prawns, mussels, clams, fish\nCarving station: prime rib, all kinds of sausages, different cuts of beef, lamb, chicken, pork\nAmerican: BBQ style foods, corn, mashed potato, hamburgers, mini hot dogs, sweet potato tater tots, scalloped potatoes, etc.\nMexican: (I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I don't quite remember what was here but there was a huge selection of dishes!) \nBread bar: tons of breads, multigrain, buns, corn bread, soft bread...but why waste precious stomach space on bread?\nJuice bar: adorable glass bottles filled with strawberry juice, hibiscus juice, horchata, mango juice, guava juice (I really wanted to take these cute bottles home, but you're not allowed to.  So sad)\nItalian: pizzas, meatballs, pastas, etc. my favorite was the cheese, dried fruit, and cured meats station!\nSalad bar: again, why waste precious stomach space on salad?\nAsian: sushi, rolls, build your own ramen, build your own udon, building your own pho, dim sum and dumplings, sticky rice, Chinese dishes, etc.\n\nDon't forget to go around the corner because there is another section that you don't want to miss out on.\n\nAnd last but definitely not least....my favorite......drumroll.....\nTHE DESSERT STATION!!\nSo many cakes, pies, chocolate covered strawberries, homemade marshmallows, cake pops, pastries, cookies, brules, tarts, cream puffs, a whole freezer of ice cream flavors, build your own crepe, build your own ice cream sandwich, Bubbies mochi ice cream (yes, correctly!  They fly over Hawaii's own Bubbies mochi ice cream!!)\nTip: when getting dessert, first go to the regular food area to pick up a plate because those are bigger than the plates at the dessert station.  That way, you can get more dessert every time you go up!\n\nAll in all, I ended up eating 9 plates and drinking three juice bottles (2x Asian food, 2x Italian food, 2x meats and other random dishes, 1x American food, 2x dessert).  I think I stretched out my tummy to a whole new level after eating here but once I started eating, I just couldn't stop!  You can really do some damage here since everything tastes so good.  Come hungry and leave happy!   Incredibly, wonderfully happy.	4
Horrible location, but well worth it.\n\nService here is friendly and there are a great many selections for hallmark cards and other hallmark items.  I do like the convenience of the post office inside which is better than the one on Greenway. It is in a horrible location and in corner and behind the Yogurt Mart but there are enough people in the neighborhood to use this location.  It seems pretty busy during the day.  I agree with Tasia T.  Great customer service.  Good selection on cards.  Don't go to the Walgreens for cards, because their selection seems to be limited to people who do not like to read.	4
This place was fantastic and the service was fabulous! I had the tomato gin soup, which is one of their house specialty. I almost locked my bowl clean. Our group had the mahi mahi, the soy-citrus salmon, the perfectly grilled salmon, and he balsamic ribeye. Everything was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious! The white chocolate brownie was mouth wetting and a great finish to the meal. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us with our decisions and what to order. His recommendations on food and beverages was perfect!	4

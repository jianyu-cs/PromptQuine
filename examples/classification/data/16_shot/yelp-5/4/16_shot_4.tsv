As soon as you walk in the front, the place is filled with smoke.  If you don't know where to go or try to ask a question, they point you to the direction. Like I'm supposed to know where the heck I'm going. Atmosphere definitely not friendly. When you go in, it felt like the main purpose was just to win money. I get that but you gotta have some fun. I was going with a group of friends and had a great time but once I lost where they were, I played a few games and was ready to get out. Staff unfriendly and guests were just as rude. Maybe a full moon was out and everyone was in a bad mood including the employees. When given another chance to go again, I'll try but don't really want to. Would not recommend this to anyone.	0
(edited to tone it down)\n\nPros:\n\n- Pizza is great\n- Beer specials on Mondays are awesome.\n\nCon:\n\n- The restaurant can be a playground for screaming children. \n\nI'm just trying to eat, have a beer, talk, and watch the game. I don't want to deal with a bunch of screaming kids running all over the place and fighting over the arcade game in the corner. Even the great beer specials on Mondays are not worth listening to that. \n\nIt must be noted that there is only so much the management can do about other peoples' children. Their parents should manage the volume - but I think some just become habituated to it.\n\nMaybe it's not like that every night. But we have noticed it twice.\n\nIf you eat here, just ask to be seated in the corner farthest from the arcade game, unless you enjoy the sound of shrieking children after working all day.\n\nObviously, if you have kids, they're a family-friendly restaurant.	0
"REVIEW IS ON THE CLUB---\nWent to see Holly's Peep Show. Very nice, especially act 2 and the view from behind of Holly's BEHIND!\n\nKoi Club-\nGot wristbands from \""promoters\"" telling us that women are free with the wristband and I would pay but free drinks all night. \n\nWe got there and it ended up being 20 bucks cover for anyone and only women's drinks were free\n\nThe dance floor, seating area and bar area are about as big as my apartment. I actually might have a better VIP area. LOL -\nWay too many people for the amount of room. There were girls there with flipflops and t-shirts. Guys with running shoes and polo's. From the facade in front you can be led to believe this is an upscale place. It's more like a local bar with a decent DJ in a pretty box. \n\nTook the girls 15 mins to get drinks, then I had to go over to the other side of their small bar to clash with the restroom go-ers to get my 8-dollar beer. \n\nGo somewhere else. Maybe BANK or TRYST"	0
Okay.....read the other reviews about taking the scenic routes and making it a longer ride that wasn't a problem with this guy. I looked up the rates did the math myself it was a 9.6 mile trip the meter came out to what I got.....But I left my 350$ nikon camera in the cab. Called the company got in touch with the driver......he tried to extort money out me to bring me my camera are you fuckin serious?!? He wanted 70$. How about I call highway patrol tell them you stole my camera have them arrest you and tow the cab?!? He has a cleft lip cab number 558 and when he starts talking fast you can't understand anything he says. Will not use nellis cab company again next time I'm in vegas which was my first time going by the way cuz I turned 22 while I was on vacation there so choose someone else	0
Im giving it a 1 star but you may not all agree with that. If your a beetles fan you may love it. Other wise its a vomit of color and repetitive flips with annoying music that has long since been outdated. Yes Im sorry hipsters but we all have to admit that the beetles aren't as good as you claim they are. maybe in our parents generation. So if you a beetles fan or a hipster that pretends to be one go you may like it. If you are not STAY AWAY!!	0
Horrible food! I had the prime rib and it was overcooked and dry and I had the baked potato and it was hard! I could barely eat it. My wife had the country fried chicken which is a Vegas special and she said it was really chewy and gross. Never going there again. :(	0
Just visited Khaos last week and I must say the outfits are cute but pricey and what really threw me off was you aren't allowed to take pictures of ANYTHING in the store. Funny thing, all I wanted to do was Twit how cute the stick on tattoos were but I was informed it was NOT ALLOWED...WOW. \nMy friend and I left the store empty handy and we were planning to buy.	0
Craving a breakfast burrito and we decided we wanted Filibertos for breakfast.  Ordered in the drive thru and the young man's language barrier was so bad that we had to pull up to the window to communicate.  \n\nHe repeated our drink order five times. ..not one or twice,  but FIVE times and it was still wrong when we got home.  He didn't understand what root beer was and asked if it was blueberry?  REALLY? We ordered Mt Dew and learned that we got lemonade once we were home.  \n\nUgh, so frustrating.  I understand is Mexican food,  but at least put someone that can communicate in tyne drive thru window.  Because I'm pissed and im sure he's frustrated or maybe he doesn't give a shit. But you'd think that management would care when their food costs are increased because they have to correct do many mistakes by remaking the food.  \n\nOn a positive note,  the inside of the restaurant was very clean when I had to go back in for the wrong item to be corrected.	0
"I used 1 of my 3 manicures that I bought on Groupon on this Friday 3/8/13.  Gary the nail tech used a clear gel and then nailpolish on top of it-  and he said that it would last for 2 weeks.  His polish was all over the sides of my nails and he said that would come out in the shower.  I left there disapointed that I had to go home and clean up my nails so that it didnt look like a 5 year old painted them.  Then I took a shower the next morning and my whole thumb nail -polish and gel - totally peeled off in 1 whole piece.  Thank god I used my own polish so that I could just paint it even though the \""Wonderful gel\"" he used had peeled off too.  Then yesterday by the end of the day 3 other nails of gel and polish had completely peeled off in one full piece.  I am not sure what products he uses -but it was horrible.  He was rude and even told me that someone called to complain that theirs chipped and he said \""too bad, I cant take you back for 2 weeks\"".  This is not someone I want to go back to considering the fact that it didnt even last for 24 hours when he said his products were so great they lasted for 2 weeks at a time.  He is a 1 man operation, so its not like I can go to someone else in the salon.  I still have 2 of these \""Gel manicures\"" that I have not used and would never go back there or sugest that any of my friends go there either."	0
I called the Cosmo 2 times to tell them the 6 of us would arrive after midnight - we were coming from Boston.  We arrive and I am told my 2 rooms have been given away so they put us in 2 Board Rooms with 2 full size Murphy Beds.  After 3 hours we finally get 2 rollaway beds brought to the room (it is now 3 am).  \n\nWe paid for the first night rooms so why did they give them away.  \n\nI find this totally unacceptable.  They moved us the next day but we had to stay in our room with our luggage until 4 pm when the rooms were ready so we missed out on a day in Vegas.\n\nI was there for a conference and many people had room problems so my advice stay at another hotel!\n\nThey also advertise the room with a kichenette, yup there is a stove and microwave but no utelsils, plate, pots & pans.  Why bother.	0
well after my boyfriend JUST waited 45 minutes for a to go order, i think it safe to say we won't be trying this place again.  both of us work in restaurants and he's a manager at a bar right down the street from Half Shell, so he know's what a bartender looks like when she's forgotten to put in an order. and not only did she forget to put the order in but she forgot his meal all together. WONDERFUL. She did offer to have it made but he already sat there for 45 mins, what makes her think he's gonna sit there and wait again due to HER error. Thanks but No thanks. \n\nP.S their ceviche is HORRIBLE, no flavor and NO juice. If i had wanted chopped up shrimp,onions, jalapeno and tomatoes i would have just made it at home. \n\nvery disappointed in this place.	0
"Maybe I have an abnormally high expectation of customer service, but this place really got my blood boiling. PItt's Dogg'n It doesn't, in fact, have anything to do with hotdogs. Okay, that's fine. But if I had to force you to take five seconds out of your precious phone conversation to tell me that, then there's a serious problem. And when you didn't in fact audibly say the word \""No,\"" when I asked you, \""Do you have any hot dogs,\"" and instead mouthed the word \""no,\"" then we have an even more serious problem. I was in the store for about 15 minutes looking around. On top of that, I made a transaction. Did the guy helping me get off the phone once? No. Did he greet me, ask me to sign my receipt, tell me to have a good day, utter the tiniest of annoyance in my direction? No. In fact, when it came time to sign my receipt, he pantomimed signing with a pen all while talking loudly on the phone. \n\nIf you can't even be bothered to get off the phone and greet the people who are spending money in your establishment then, frankly, you don't deserve any of my own or anyone else's money. \n\nLearn how to run a damn business or at least employ people that will show your business in a decent light."	0
"I stopped in Urban Wax for an eye brow wax and met with quite possibly the most rude and confrontational person I've ever experienced in a professional setting named Sara.  I sat down and tried to explian to Sara the brow shape I wanted.  She kept drawing outlines on my brows that were completely opposite of what I described.  When i tried to explain again, she became ANGRY and said she knew what she was doing, that she was the \""expert\"".  When I told her that she was making me uncomfortable she quickly raised my chair for me to get up!  I told her she was being very inappropriate and she began to RAISE HER VOICE with me--to the point that one of the girls from a back room came out to see what was going on.  The recpetionist at the front desk, Jessica, was very quiet (though she heard everything that transpired), but polite and said she would have the owner call me.  Mean while, Sara sat in a chair trying to ARGUE that she didn't do anything wrong and that I was \""the inappropriate one\"".  I told her she was out of line speaking to a customer like this--she bobbed her head back and forth and just kept trying to engage me in a confrontation.  It was a surreal experience.  Would hate to have her come near me with hot wax.  I've read the reviews for Urban Wax and it looks like a nice salon, but they should seriously consider getting rid of people like this girl before more bad reviews start pouring in."	0
"Streets of New York was, by far, the worst place I have ever been.\nMaybe it was just a location thing but I'll never go to another one because of it.\nWe get in and are told to sit anywhere so we pick a spot, sit down, and wait. and wait. and wait. \nThen a busser or someone who is obviously not a waiter comes over, literally throws us our menus and unenthusiastically says, \""She'll be with you in a minute.\""\nSo we wait, again.\nFinally she shows up, takes our drink orders and then disappears for another ten minutes. There's only like 4 other full tables in the place and she wasn't the only waiter; i'm pretty patient when waiting for foods and drinks at restraunts. On top of that, I've never had water that tasted so much like dirt before.\nShe comes back. Leaves. THEN comes back and takes our order. She asks us if we want their free bread and we say yes. TEN MINUTES later, the bread finally comes out and it's actually really good.\nThe pizza came out shortly after, finally our pizza comes out.\nWe did have a special order. One side was a chicken Alfredo pizza with Alfredo sauce, tomatoes, onions, and chicken and for me, I got cheese. Except my cheese pizza had onions on it. I couldn't eat it. And my companion's pizza was so terrible, no one finished it. There were little whole tomatoes soaked in vinegar; not sure what else was wrong with it.\n\nI will never. Ever. Go back to Streets Of New York. Not because of the food quality, but because of the service."	0
Tried this place again while I was getting my oil changed next door. Middle of the day, no one in the place and still lousy service. Ordered a beer that was flat. I told them about it and they changed the keg but didn't offer to replace the flat beer they gave me. I will say the service wasn't so much intentionally bad, I just think they don't known what they're doing. In any other city that may be fine but in the area they're in, there are much better choices.  Go to PTs or Porch Light. Seriously.	0
Horrible! Sunday playoffs and not enough servers?!?!? Wtf! Yes I said it ! 2nd bar area could not be open because not enough employees ?!?! Wow is this a franchise or corp. ? Owners get new management or more help! I am with a party of 16 and no attempt to even try to accommodate us?!?! Wow! I asked if we could just stand at the tables in second bar , and we would use the bar for service . But Jamie said NO! So instead we are left standing or sitting on the dance floor to watch the big screen .We are football fans/ drinkers! Jamie was of no help either! She's rude and useless when it comes to customer service! We are very disappointed with staff and overall experience.	0
Well....uhh...Rhythm Kitchen puts forward a great effort to bring NOLA-style food to Vegas, but I gotta say they may need to make another trip down to the dirty south that I love so much and call home. We went here to watch some acquaintances play upstairs (which rocked btw) and we started with the spin/art dip (4 stars). For an entree decided I'd stick with something fried (that's what we do in the south - fry things) so I ordered the fried catfish (3 stars) with a side of red beans and rice (1 star). The catfish was 'aight', but the red beans and rice were pretty horrible I gotta say (to the point they had to be bathed in Tabasco before being edible). Service was okay, but the guy was SWAMPED and definitely needed help. I generally give places another shot, but I can't say I wanna head back here for seconds.	1
A bit overpriced ($90 / $85 with the Total Rewards card); and not a good return on that money.  We were here on 09/28/14 Sunday with a 12pm reservation.\n\nFirst of all, if you still decide to go, make your reservations for the earlier times (9:30am to 12pm), as they do tend to run out of the better things after 12pm.  You can sign up for the free Total Reward card at the Bally's hotel, where the buffet is at; located at the same BLT Steak restaurant; which turns into the steakhouse in the evenings.\n\nThe Pros:\nAYCE lobster, lamb chops, caviar, champagne, & king crab legs, and they give you a Popover at the beginning of the meal (but they ran out of them at around 1:30pm)\n\nThe Cons:\nThe lobster was a bit tough; and after around 1pm, instead of a whole lobster tail, they started putting out a half tail.  When we arrived at 12pm, we heard they had run out of oysters already.  The filet Mignon was just a small piece of meat in a small pan, not very tasty, actually kind of bland.  The nigiri sushi didn't look fresh; Genki sushi tasted better.  Lobster bisque (which you have to order from the waiter) was bland.  The service was also lacking; as our waiter catered to a certain table of 6, and pretty much ignored us.\n\nOverall; it's a quantity over quality.  We came for the AYCE lobster , filet Mignon, and crab, and the pictures here did look great.  But it was a disappointment.  For your money, find another buffet.  :(	1
"First time to visit, Saturday around 12:30. Not very busy. Waiter Ray.  Ordered an appetizer of ceviche, a beer and a blood orange sangria, which was great!  After about 20 mins, the waiter finally realized we never received our app.  He then tells us they are all out.  Our chips and salsa had been eaten...he took the chips to refill but not the salsa.  Finally got more salsa.  I ordered the beef stew which is a new item and my husband ordered the shrimp salad.  His salad was very good with great flavor.  The mango dressing was very tasty. The taste of the stew was very good but when I finally tossed the stew around abit I only found 1  - 1/4\"" x 1/4\"" piece of beef.  For the price it should have been more.  Brought the waiter over and he got me more which was better beef than the piece that was in there.   For our first visit, it won't be some place we would return to.  Flavor was good, sangria was good. Maybe Just an off day but there are many restaurants to choose from.  We'll stick with Brio or try our luck at Echo and Rig."	1
Food was so so service slow. Servers don't pay attention. God awful ugly waitresses. Annoying crowd and unfriendly atmosphere is probably due to the demographic of the area. Buffalo chicken sandwich was ok. Side of fries should be bigger. Wouldn't recommend this location. The Chandler location was much better.	1
"Stayed here once.  And no joke, on my floor alone we saw police take down a group smoking dope in their room -- and also prostitutes walking around -- saying hello to us.  Yeah.  But other than that \""excitement\"" -- it was an enjoyable stay.  The casino is nice.  The location is a tad off The Strip, but not far.  Rates were extremely low -- probably because they make money off the prostitutes on the side!"	1
I eat here from time to time because it's close to my house.  The last time I was here I ordered the carne asada super burrito, it was good, filled with meat in every bite, not today!  This place is as so unpredictable with the quality and quantity of the food it's ridiculous!!!  The middle of the burrito had NO MEAT!!!  Seriously! !  Not sure if I will be coming back because I don't know what to expect.   What is really sad is if the owners actually read these reviews,  good and bad, they don't give a shit about the bad ones, because you never hear from them.......	1
This place used to be really awesome now lately it just sucks.\nThe food is good but service sucks butt! No joke I gave it so many tries and it just seems like this place is just slowly down grading itself. \nI knew service was bad here but I figured maybe give it another go.\n\n:( Man was that a bad Idea. \n\nI order a spicy yellowtail roll and a eel  bento entree. My date order the salmon collar app and a beef hibachi entree.\nSo we knew collars take forever to come out so we ordered that first before even deciding what entrees we wanted. So the spicy yellowtail came out, and man that thing was the ugliest sushi I've ever seen. It was so half-ass made. The rice wasn't even sticking together the fish look so odd o.O it felt like a gamble to eat. \nSo then we got our soups that comes with the entree and I didn't even get to take a sip of it and my entree came out super fast and my date is left waiting for his for about 7 mins or so and I had to starting eating my food before it got cold. Now, were basically almost done eating and our collar never came. So I ask about how much longer, she had the balls to say I never ordered it! Are you serious that was the first thing I ordered after the drinks. \nAnd surprisingly it's nothing new they forgot my beer before and didn't even remember till I was done eating AND I had to ask for myself.\n\nThis place needs some serious 9-1-1 server training!\n\nI don't think I'm ever coming back again. \n\nI was so mad I was just like give me the check already.	1
"I have heard lots of good stuff about this place so my expectaions were set high. \nThe morning we went was beautiful so we sat on the patio. It's a nice patio with a nice view of the area, but nothing extra special about it.\nWe really came to eat, and not realx but it was relaxing and service was pretty good too.\nThe menu seemed small to me, not a lot of options, but what was striking was the prices. This place is Very expencive, even for Scottsdale! a basic 2 egg, bacon, potato, and toast breakfast, inwich was on the small side is 10.50 almost everything eles cost more! and It seemed any little change or modification incured an \""up-charge\"" 1 dollar for jalepeno jelly... Really!!!! thats just the start.\nWhat was exceptional was the Buttermilk dill toast, by far the best toast I ever had! but when asked if they sell the bread to go I found out they do, but it's $12 a loaf. keep it.\nThe corn bread was just as yummy but they make you pay for the jalepeno jelly, $1 for an ounce, YIKES!\nDotties is \""good\"" but for the prices, either the portions need to be improved, or stop nickle and diming for extras. For now I'm eating at other places.\nThis corner has been lots of things, restaurants seem to come and go here, I wonder who or what will be next, as I dont think this place has staying power."	1
Standard food as with all locations. It was the service that ruined it when the order taker became so frustrated by me not wanting the drink that came with the kids meal. He was flustered and rude like I was inconveniencing him because we had our own water. It's 110 degrees out. \n\nAnyway, at least it was clean and the food filled us up.	1
pricey for a breakfast spot, and food was not spectacular.	1
This place sucks.  First, if you're not a local they charge a ridiculous cover charge.  I had to pay $10 on a Wednesday!  Second, the female bartender has no personality and acts like you owe her for being there.  She totally hates her job and makes everyone feel that negative vibe.  The two guy bartenders were good in that they were at least responsive and attentive.  The show sucked and the drag queen that performed had a huge run in her stockings.  So second class.  Otherwise, it's an OK club.	1
After looking at the menu and having a groupon burning in my pocket I was pretty excited to try out Remington's Restaurant.  Unfortunately that's as far as the excitement went as far as dining experience went. \n\nPro's:\nLocation\n\nCon's:\nFly landing on bread bowl\nHost's dressed like morgue workers\nFood comes out with plastic dome's over it to keep warm but really wasn't too warm anyways\nFelt very dated inside \nServer pointed out total before groupon like I was going to stiff him on tip \n\nOverall I will not be back and wasn't impressed at all.  I guess if you are staying at the resort it's not a bad choice but I'd still go for a quick drive to one of the many other fine establishments within a short distance.	1
"Normally I would give this a higher rating because I have never experienced a problem here like I did today. The food was fine, but the girl  that gives you the food was very rude. I ordered a baked potato and when it came up she gave me one butter and one sour cream. I gave her the sour cream back and said I needed alot of butter. So she hands me one more, I said again, I need alot of butter, so she hands me one more(now I have 3). I looked at her and said how many more can I have? So she hands me two more(5) and smart's off \""if you need anymore, I will have to charge you for them\"". WTH? Really?? It's a small pat container of butter. I have NEVER been charged for them in any of the Showmars restaurants. And usually they give me so many I have to take some back. She acted like I was taking something personally from her. I can understand with the dressings, if you get more than 2 they charge you. But this is butter for crying out loud. That's like charging for ketchup packs. \""Some\"" people just don't need to be out front in a customer service setting. Maybe the back area is more her speed."	1
"I'm sad to say that Super Burrito \""fell off\"".  I've ordered twice here in the past few months and the food has not been good.  The burrito (Potato, Egg & Cheese) I'd been ordering for years was extremely greasy and undercooked.  Another time I ordered take out with my friend and the enchiladas were dry, lacked seasoning and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I felt so bad, I cooked up something for her at home.  I'm not sure if there is a new chef, but I am terribly disappointed in the recent changes."	1
I'm from pig country, Eastern North Carolina.\n\nWhile I'm now a vegetarian, back in the day when I worked across the street, my coworkers ranted and raved about this joint. So naturally, I had to check it out.\n\nThis is not real barbeque....I would never pay $15 for real barbeque either.\nI should have ran when I saw queso on the menu.\n\nIf you're in town on business and you're from the midwest, this place might be fantastic! But if you're used to smoking a pig in your backyard and dousing it in vinegar or going to a mom and pop shop that hasn't been updated since the '70's you won't like it.\n\nI only had the barbeque here once and it was severely under-seasoned. The service wasn't extraordinary either. \n\nIt's mediocre, that's all I can say.\n\nWith that being said, BBQ King off Wilkinson is said to be some of the best 'que in the Queen City. And honestly, I prefer Cookout's bbq over Queen City Que's. \n\nIf you're uptown and looking for barbeque, don't. Unfortunately this is not where they serve the good stuff.	1
this is the second time i've stayed at the Rio in ten years. We got there on a friday night at about 1am. When we got to the room, the beds were not made, towels on the floor, and drinks from the previous guests were on th bathroom counters. My wife called down to complain and they said they would send up housekeeping, but I thought an entirely different room was more appropriate so we went back to the front desk and requested and got a new room. The problem with a lot of mediocre establishments now is that there is no legitimate effort to make things right. The front desk person really acted as if giving us a dirty room and then changing it was no big deal. I guess this is why I probably will not go back, As I seem to get older I expect good if not great service all of the time. The oh, I'm sorry sir, here ya go kinda attitude really doesn't cut it anymore.	1
Entering the restaurant I was welcomed with a warm smell of delicious food.  The atmosphere was very cute.  I'd imagine this place probably looks adorable at Christmas time.  Sadly I was disappointed with my meal.  I got the special: tilapia and artichokes in a lemon sauce with steamed vegetables on the side.  The tilapia was mediocre.  Fishier than normal for tilapia. My friend tried it and thought so too. I'm willing to give this place another shot,  so I'll likely be back.  As of my experience tonight I have nothing to rave about.	2
We went to this place for a friend's graduation party around 11pm. I agree with the other posters that this is a very odd shaped bar! It felt very segregated and did not really allow for cross party interaction as the place is basically split into two. The karaoke was fun and the guy running it was a cool older guy. He did a couple songs too! Didn't try any of the food this time around but kind of want to go back to redeem myself from a bad karaoke attempt lol. It did take a while to get a drink. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas. There were two girls working the bar and it still took quite a while to have my order taken. I didn't want to get up in their faces so I was waiting towards the end of the bar and eventually had to have a seat it was taking so long.	2
"I like their coffee - they have one of the better lattes in town (I like a couple other places in Champaign downtown as well). I appreciate their establishment being here in Urbana downtown. Thank you. \n\nHowever, I wish they would work on improving their service and treatment of their customers a little bit. Being \""super hipster\"" does not and should not equal to bad service (..right?). One time, my order failed to go through, and when I approached them about 15 minutes later asking about my coffee, the barista at the time did not even apologize to me -- she snorted. They make good coffee, but sometimes I find myself not looking forward to going here because of the anticipated interaction with some of their pompous staff."	2
"Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food, I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta, mushrooms, and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger, really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try, this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger (sorry a pound is just too much food) with cheddar jack, bacon and sauteed mushrooms, we ordered a half order of the \""best of both worlds\"" which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese , the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake, the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone, my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced, the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey, so all in all it was a pretty decent burger, I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger patty\n\nOverall my experience was good, and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance, the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu, despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before, though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni, peanut butter, coleslaw, Sri racha burger, I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled"	2
Pizza is pretty good but nothing too special. For a place right on Fremont St I was surprised that it was so cheap though. Fairly extensive selection of draft beer for a pizza joint too. And what!? Brooklyn Beer in Las Vegas? Nice touch RCP.\n\nI will say, I witnessed an order of macaroni and bacon balls or something of the sort. That sounds too good to be legal, so I may have to be back to try that and perhaps adjust my rating accordingly.	2
"-------------\nThe Quick:\n-------------\n\nGood, but not great, contemporary American fare that is served in a setting and demeanor too casual to be called fine-dining. \n\n-------------\nThe Details:\n-------------\n\nDuring my latest outing to Las Vegas, I was searching for a new fine-dining restaurant to try. To my disappointment, I was not encouraged by any of the new offerings and decided that I would go with a repeat visit to the current fine-dine Vegas champ restaurant Alex (see my review for more details). Unfortunately, I was greatly saddened by the fact that Alex had recently closed! I could not find a clear answer to why it had closed as it attracted a fair amount of diners and was not lacking in the recognition department (2-star Michelin). Nonetheless, I was left in the situation where I had to \""settle\"" for one of the new fine-dine establishments I have yet to try over the last year or two. \n\n...which leads me to Sage. As alluded to in Vegas dining magazines and articles I had read on the web, it appears hotel owners (like Wynn/Encore) believe that most Vegas visitors do not hover toward traditional, intimate, true fine-dining environments. They believed they could attract the most customers via establishments that had good food, but a more relaxed, hip, and glamorous (showy) experience. My opinion on this school of though set aside, it basically left me no choice but to pick a restaurant that was not as fine-dine as I originally wanted. With the exception of Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon, there are really no more true fine-dine establishments in Las Vegas (at least that i know of). \n\nAnyways, here are the concrete details of my dining experience at Sage:\n\n1) Food - I didn't care for the offered tasting menu and to my surprise, not everyone at the table had to have the tasting menu. Consequently my gf got the tasting menu as I elected to pick off the a la carte menu.\n\na) Appetizer #1: Pacific Yellow Tail Crudo w/ shaved trumpet mushrooms, black winter truffle, and toasted pine nuts\n-I'm always a fan of raw fish and especially yellow tail so this dish was a no-brainer for me. The tangy citrus marinade worked well with the inherent flavor of the fish. However, I was not a fan of the shaved (raw) mushroom and felt it did not blend with the other ingredients of the dish. \n\nb) Appetizer #2: Chilled Dungeness Crab Salad with fennel, tangerine, and creme fraiche\n-Again, another favorite classic ingredient of mine: crab. Good flavors, probably my favorite dish of the night. Very delicate, mild tastes in the salad. Not overpowering but just the right amount of flavor to not mask the sweetness of the crab meat. \n\nc) Entree: Bluenose Grouper with chanterelles, leeks, parsley root\n-Why did I get this dish? Why didn't I go for the kobe? Yeah, I have no idea actually. In hindsight, I should have gone for the bold flavors of the meat dishes and skipped the fish. The grouper was okay, but did not stand out at all. It had some decent flavor and was of course cooked perfectly. It was strictly ordinary and ordinary was not something one looks for in such a high-end establishment. \n\n2) Service - subpar in the context of true fine-dining establishments. Our waiter did not do anything especially wrong or was especially rude, but like a lot of the other components of this restaurant, he was merely okay. I could not differentiate whether the waiter simply had a natural, apathetic demeanor or he did want to serve us. In either case, however, his bored, casual affect immediately disappointed my dining experience. \n\nOverall, Sage was a forgettable restaurant in a slew of similar, high-end, but ordinary Las Vegas restaurants. Sure, it was pretty good food overall, but you honestly find good food like that in almost any other 4/5 star hotel in Vegas. There was nothing that made it stand out from the competition nor did it possess a theme, trait, dish, or element of service that compels me to return."	2
Not been to All Bar One in a very long time. I do like the decor inside, and service was very good.I think the trick us to go when it is quiet as I've been here on saturday night and been three people deep to get to the bar for a drink!. Sunday to Wednesday they have cocktails for \u00a3 4.50! Which is popular! it's not my favourite on George street but I would go back and they seem to have plenty promotions on!	2
Stayed here over Memorial Weekend and a friend booked 2 rooms for a group of us. The hotel itself was pretty good, but it being my first time in Sin City since turning 21+ I had always imagined I would be staying on the Strip but I didn't mind in favor of saving money!\n\nThe suites were quite spacious, probably could have easily fit our entire group into one. Each room comes with 2 fulls/queens (I don't know how to tell mattress sizes...), TV, desk, sitting area with an arm chair, sofa, and coffee table, full size bathroom including separate bathtub and shower stall, a mini kitchen with a microwave, minifridge, sink, and a breakfast table. In addition to all this, the other room had a two-range electric stove in the minikitchen though we didn't have one in ours...\n\nThe only gripes I have about the place is their slight slow response to housekeeping requests, such as extra towels or blankets. At one point we had called 3 times to check up on our extra blankets until late at night. The other gripe I have is the distance from the Strip. While it wasn't really too far, it gets pretty tiring going back and forth a few times in a day. We didn't want to drive anywhere within Vegas so we would commute back and forth by walking. At times it wouldn't be too bad, until the blazing sun would come out and pound on us, or just when exhaustion from walking all day gets to you. After a few times, we learned to cut through Bally's Casino down the street since it was air-conditioned! Yay!\n\nLastly, they had a restaurant on the casino floor that had a midnight special on steak and eggs for $3.99 that also includes hash browns and your choice of bread. While I didn't personally get to try it, all my friends enjoyed it tremendously - I'm sure the price made it all the more better too ;). For those interested, the special is only good between the hours of 12am - 5am. But if you just miss it, they have a special on a burger and fries for $4.99 which I heard was also quite good.\n\nExtras: pretty nice lobby with a counter for half-price show tickets but a rather small pool :\\\n\nSo, overall 3 stars. It is a fairly nice place and sufficient enough for those wanting to save money. I would recommend this place to friends looking for cheaper alternatives and for them to bring comfortable shoes!	2
An above-average airport spot.  I was there on National Margarita Day - 2/21 - Yay!  Only I had a beer, Rita's were a bit pricy.\n\nAny who -- I had a chopped salad & was able to sub pork al pastor for the grilled chicken.  Great call!  The Al pastor flavor was very nice & a great complement to the cilantro dressing on the chopped salad.\n\nFriendly service & easy in and out.  Best part was I could see my gate & was able to sit comfortably until they started boarding.	2
Went for a business lunch, the decor is nice, servers were attentive.  I got a my fish broiled and it was a bit soggy, but tasted alright.  Want to give this place another try as this time wasn't spectacular, but wasn't bad.	2
I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was sooooo salty that it was almost painful to eat. I'm not sure what went wrong, but it was definitely done wrong. It's been a long time since we've been here and I don't remember the eggplant being this bad the last time. I doubt we'll go here anytime soon for food, but the bar area is cozy and relaxing.	2
Love the lunch specials.  The food and service is average.  I don't get all the menu's though.  We went for lunch the other day and we were each given 5 different menus with different items on them-to only find out that we actually had a few were different.  It was confusing and a little ridiculous.	2
"Average is what comes to mind about this place. Decent selection and clean enviroment. Nothing special about the atmosphere. Usually pretty empty inside. I do like the fast and courteous service. It's a good spot for quick lunch while at work.\n\ni've never really tried their \""chinese-style\"" entrees, but they looked too greasy for me to be appetizing. Sushi was average, not too fresh, but not terrible. Deserts (frozen peach sorbet) was yummy, albeit a bit frozen.\n\nOverall, just an average sushi place. Okay for lunch if you work near-by, but otherwise, go somewhere else."	2
Time to update this review.  I often need to send out packages via FedEx and these little stores help me do that.  2 yrs ago, I had a bad experience with an employee.  Since most employees who work in places like this don't stay very long, I knew he wouldn't be around for very long.  After about 6 months, I went back to use this location and he was in fact no longer working there...good.\n\nNow I use this place form time to time to send out packages or faxes when I'm out of the office.  Easy to use their services and their location is convenient to restaurants and bars.  What more can I ask for?\n\nReturn Factor - 75%	2
We had la reggae and la Matty. The poutines we had were amazing! Best we ever had so far. We got takeout because we waited in line forever to be seated when we went in a group of 5 but they let the group of 5 after us seated before us. Why?! That's fine, we then got seated and was left there for 20 mins and nobody served us so we got up and ordered takeout. It sucks when a place's food is so amazing but the service is poor. I understand it's a 24/hr place and is constantly busy but at least make an effort in training and hiring the proper servers. This place would have so much more potential if their service improved. I will consider returning for takeout but def. not dining in.	2
This was just ok.  Nothing really special about them.  I ordered korean beef short robs combo that came with shredded pork loin, egg quiche,  and pork egg rolls.  Overall..just ok. The shredded pork was good but had a weird grain or texture that I couldn't figure out.  My boyfriend ordered beef pho...it was good. Thw soup had good flavor.\nNot the best in town...my favorite is still Pho Saigon 8.	2
"The BFs coworker is a bit of a foodie and declared this to be his favorite over the other AYCEs, even better than our favorite haunt. We were in the area and decided to go for dinner at $26.95 pp.\n\n-NIGIRI-\n\n*Albacore- even though it just says plain, it kinda comes slightly like \""cajun albacore\"" that other sushi spots do. It has a bit of pepper, thin slice of jalapeno and ponzu. It was pretty tasty and fresh so we ordered quite a bit. \n*Super White Tuna- was pretty fresh\n*Yellowtail- decent, but not as fresh as other ayces I've had.\nSpicy Octopus- this is a mix of thin sliced sweet vinegared tako, jalapeno, masago...must for the fans of tako no sunomono.\n(Seared Pepper baby tuna- this was peppered tuna that was freshly torched. I like this kind of stuff, but the BF thought the sear makes it a bit chewy.\n*Mackerel- This was totally the star and what impressed me the most. Every have mackerel where it is just kinda dry, fishy, and very salty? Not here. It was fresh cut off a fish and not bought salt packed/salt cured. I almost never order this since it rarely gives me satisfaction...I got several orders. I have not been this pleased with mackerel aside from sashimi I had at Ichiza. The chef puts ponzu on it which makes sense to me since at home I squeeze lemon on mine and soy and helps a lot of people with the strong flavors, but if you want it pure make sure to opt for dry. It was amazing alone with some fresh wasabi. \n* Sashimi Yellowtail...odd, but these pieces tasted better than the nigiri. \n* Sashimi Albacore w/ Jalapeno- it was rolled with thin sliced red onion as well which gave a nice bite to it. \n\n-ROLLS-\n\n*Salmon Skin handroll- it's a comfort staple I end every AYCE meal with. Love. \n*Albacore Crunch- this was spicy tuna roll with albacore topped with sweet onion fried onion strings with a spicy garlic ponzu. The fried onions wasn't what I was expecting when the BF said it has \""crunchies\"" and made for nice texture and a bit of a sweet flavor element. \n\nWe're not big on rolls, but some perked out interest. However we were too full for more. \n\n-APPETIZERS-\n\n*Monkey Brain- mushroom with tuna and creamcheese fried and served with a spicy cream sauce. This was really good, with a lot going on that went well together, but I can still taste the separate elements. \n*Softshell crab- I love these things. Poor crabs. I must have had 10 of them. \n*Hamachi Kama- it was fresh fish. I think Island Sushi down the street takes the prize though since they cook theirs much longer which makes for crispy skin. There were parts of this skin that was just fatty and rubbery still so I left it alone. \n*Butter Saute Scallop- it comes on a hot plate in butter and herbs. They weren't rubbery or overcooked. This is a very plain app, but good to me. Sometimes I just want scallops simple. I put a tiny bit of soy into the mix and it was some good little bites.\n*Kalbi Ribs- these were cooked on a hot plate. They were pretty soft and had decent flavors\n*Firecracker- wonton crackers with tuna, avocado with spicy sauce and a sweet kinda honey sesame sauce. I liked these, they did get pretty spicy- fire cracker indeed!\n\nWe ended with green tea tempura ice cream and mango mochi. I don't get why they put chocolate sauce on my mango mochi...its best to leave a good thing alone so maybe tell them to lay off the sauce. Also was limit one contrary to a earlier review by Patrick D. stating no limit.\n\n-SERVICE-\nOur sushi chef was nice, the owner (also working at the sushi bar, on the other side) came to check on us and even the sushi chef working aside the one in front of us also checked on us. Food came out in a good amount of time even though they were busy. The servers cleared plates fast! I mean sometimes I would be trying to move a plate out of the way and there's someones hand grabbing at it nearly missing a few degrees of me being doused in sauce. However, I'd turn around to ask for some appetizers and they're gone off. Someone snuck in hands to refill drinks fast as well. They didn't really check on us to see if we needed stuff from the kitchen so we flagged down if we wanted stuff. Then when we were ready for dessert, we were ignored when we asked and our sushi chef was too who shouted and pointed to us saying \""Dessert\"". And it wasn't because they were busy, in fact, 4 of them were standing by us or milling about picking up an order. We were held hostage for a bit til I was able to catch someones attention. It was just very odd front of the house service. Also, the ladies weren't very personable, one even seemed a bit cranky at how \""big\"" our orders are which was polarities different from the cheerful sushi men. I wouldn't put several orders if I didn't think it was so hard to put in a order.\n\nOverall- I think this is a good place with the nicest ambiance and pretty plating. I get why the BFs coworker recommended it. However, my favorite place still remains because of the awesome service on both sides of the bar."	3
A total hole in the wall place! Just ate here and it was quite tasty! The owner was super friendly and had a tasting a bunch of pastry samples. My husband had the burger and really enjoyed it. I had the southwest wrap and was unsure of it but the owner said he wouldn't charge me if I didn't like it. Needless to say, I paid. Oh yeah! We als split fries which were cooked to perfection and seasoned with pepper. So delicious! \nThe only awkward part was the ambiance. There was no music or anything so we felt like we had to talk softly so as not to disturb the other diners. We will definitely be back.	3
Great Monday special (cheeseburger & fries). Customer service always good. Owner even checks in with patrons.	3
I was there last week with some friends for happy hour. They have margaritas $1 off and 1/2 price appetizers. The blueberry margarita was delicious!	3
The scene of my favorite springtime lunch activity.  What is it?  Getting a mozzarella sandwich and than heading over to Steele Indian School park and heckling the urban fisherman as they struggle in vain to bring in their catch of garbage fish.\n\nThe sandwich is magical in its simplicity.  The rest of the sandwich world should take note.	3
We just are in love with the smoked wings here as well as the chicken salads. The bread pudding is a fav as well.	3
I feel as though this place needs a little more love.  First of all, its nice to go to a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Szechuan food.  If you haven't had food from this region of China, it kind of like comfort food.  It tends to be spicy and, yes, a little oily some times.  Most of the spicy dishes are also complimented by the nice floral flavor of ash berry, also know as Szechuan peppercorn.  Some people have complained about oil but when I have not ordered the spicy and hot, the food has been less oily than most places.  Everything I have tried, I have enjoyed.	3
The apple pancakes were piping hot and full of apple, cinnamon and real maple syrup. This place has a cool early morning vibe: mixture of old folks, families and business people getting ready for the day and enjoying the company and the food. \n\nService could be faster, but the place was slammed.	3
Update as of 2/6/14...\n\nTip: sit at the bar if you can, the service will be more prompt and attentive, and it's a bit more warm (in the winter months)\n\nTip #2: ask for the extra spicy Blazing Saddle margarita. It features an even spicier infused tequila\n\nTip #3: visit during happy hour (4:30pm - 6:30pm); two margaritas and two beers were less than $15\n\nLooks like the menu has been slightly revamped; the bar menu features some street tacos that looked absolutely superb. Alas, I was off to Tempest for dinner, so there wasn't any food consumed during this most recent visit.	3
Had a blast with my fiance. \nWent to the arcade had a blast.\nGot the most prizes in my life.\nShopping there can make you gk broke cause theres just way to many cute stores with to many cute items lol\nCool show different and free everytime cant beat it.\nGet a nice tall margeritra and have fun	3
I bought my bike here maybe 2 years ago. Anytime I come in for something, they are super cool and friendly.\nI have dropped my bike off twice to have stuff done to it, and the guy has always offered to bring me my bike up at my work. I dont know if this is a normal thing they do, but RAD none the less!	3
First time here. Stopped here early morn(6am) for a trip from California to Colorado .. Good food, quick service and a very friendly staff.	3
"Pricing wasn't bad at all,  because it was ladies night.  \n\nShooters world is relatively close to our house.  My Wife  has been wanting to go shooting for a while now.  Being that it was Valentines Day and we've done all of the commercial events over the years, I thought to break up the mundane. It was ladies night, so we only paid for my weapon rental and both of our ammo.  It was a great hour spent hitting our targets and learning about gun safety.  \n\nMy only con is that the customer service isn't the best.  When our time was done instead of politely communicating that... this guy basically told us to leave. \""Your hour is up, Y'all need to hurry up or pay for another hour\"" We were already packed up with case's in hand. Which is why is comment was confusing. \n\nOther than that, it was a great time!  We'll definitely go back!"	3
Went for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It was a Thursday night at 8 and the place was full but we didn't wait at all as I think we got the last table.  I've been here one other time on a Friday or Saturday and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 2.  The service was good and pretty quick for how busy they were.\n\nWe tried the Ruben and it was one of the better Rubens we have had.  The sides were a little better than average, but the broccoli slaw was outstanding.  We also had the London broil, better than average but just a little tough.  The jerk chicken quesadilla was amazing and we would definitely get it again.\n\nWe will come back here for sure, for the food, the good beer selection, and the chill atmosphere.  A great place.  Would have given five stars had the menu been a little bigger offering more variety.	3
Pleasantly surprised by the friendliness, cleanliness, and all the amenities for the price. Jennifer even called someone on her cell phone to find out the closest favorite Burger joint (In N Out for me, Rally's for my wife) and everyone working there was most hospitable, all of 5 minutes from Sky Harbor, cannot be beat for the price	3
Moving to Las Vegas, I found excellent Vietnamese, Japanese and Thai; to make me feel absolutely at home, those staples need to be rounded out with smoked jerk chicken. I ate at a couple of places before finding this one is just the way I like it. The chicken is tender, not too spicy, served with two wonderful homemade sauces. The spicy sauce was way too hot for me when I put just a dab on my finger, but eaten together with the chicken, was nice and flavorful and not very spicy at all. I was really surprised. Plantains are tasty you get a nice salad and traditional delicious rice. A huge plus was homemade watermelon juice. I love homemade lemonade - but this is going to replace some of that.  \n\nThe restaurant is no frills , so this one is all about the food. It was a bit hard to locate the place at first. When you get off 15 going North Take Charelston East to 3rd street and it is just about on the corner. You should see a sign on the sidewalk. \n\nEnjoy man, enjoy...	3
Nestled inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this joint provides a fun, relaxing atmosphere with premium food.\n\nMusic lil loud, but where in Vegas isn't, right? The jams fit the age of the crowd everyone was singing along having a blast.\n\nBone -in Rib eye= succulent \nMushrooms = flavorful\npotato's  a delight.  \nBread with there oil and pesto sauce = WOW.. please dont remind me, im so hungry now...\n\nits a better alt then a mundane buffet i think. but then again the wicked spoon on the second fl. is legit too.\n\nplus, you night actually see some celebrities.	4
"Agree with everybody who gave 5 stars: \""The BEST Japanese food in Arizona.\"" \""It's a no nonsense ma & pa kind of place with good food.\"" \n\nThey provide good size portions and are inexpensive.  I like the katsudon."	4
Best service ever and best food ever! Delicious pizza and appetizer! Best vodka ever and locally owned! Bam bam we love Carlos! Will go back.	4
Yum. Thank you yelpers. I was so excited about trying this place, but was worried that my expectations would be too high after hearing all then praise. Luckily, this place is not overrated! \n\nPapaya Pad Thai, a delightful spin on traditional noodle dish. I don't think I ever want it any other way. The Tom Yum soup was so wonderful. These were my two favorite dishes. I've had better Duck Curry, but it was a solid dish nonetheless. Same for the Deep Fried Catfish with Green Chilies.\n\nI'll definitely be a regular here! =)	4
Simply put: The way a business should be run.  \n\nI have been using the Lakes Cleaners since I moved to Las Vegas and the work they do is exemplary.  The owner's name is Carol and she couldn't be anymore sweeter.  She doesn't just dry clean clothes, but she honestly takes a genuine interest in all her customers.  Not only does she remember whats going on with me, but I see her have these kinds of conversations with everyone who walks through the door.  The Summerlin/Lakes community is lucky to have this gem of a place serving it. \n\nHer prices are reasonable and, her turnaround times are efficient and the attention to detail is amazing.  You cant really see the Lakes Cleaners from the street but its in the plaza at Sahara and Durango behind the Subway and 7-11.  Once you find it however, I can honestly say you wont go anywhere else.\n\nGoing to the cleaners isn't a task or chore when visiting the Lakes, its one of the highlights of my week!	4
I love a good cup of frozen yogurt.  So far Yogurtland is my favorite chain to visit!  This one is pretty close to my house too, so it makes it even more tempting.  \n\nWhat draws me into a place like Yogurtland is it's layout and decor.  I love the modern style of most of the Yogurtland interiors, it's kinda like an IKEA!  I love the straight lines, the use of dark wood, the colors.  Yes, to some folks this kind of design in BLAH and BLEH and boring but I love clean.  I am a clean and near-clutter free FREAK.  So I like the minimalism and the organization.  Planning is good!\n\nWe go here at least once a month.  Myself, I'm more into the yogurt flavors themselves and checking out what Yogurtland has to offer on a monthly basis.  My kids however?  More into the toppings.  Little itty bitty amounts of yogurt, and lots of toppings!  This is what can make your damn cup of frozen yogurt so expensive!  And at the current 35 cents an ounce it can be quite the price for that cup.  Last time, my little one got like 3 tiny hills of yogurt and topped it mochi balls, almonds, gummy worms, cheesecake, and God knows what else...and it ended up costing me $7!  Yeah, watch your kids!\n\nI actually like the yogurt and want to try most flavors on every occasion.  But I always stick to my faves:  Taro, Plain Tart, and Coconut.  Yep, you guessed it, I'm Asian!  The only gripe I have sometimes is that Taro is not always in stock with the yogurt machines.  It should be a C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T and never, ever rotated out!  It's kinda what defines Yogurtland as being an Asian-founded frozen yogurt shop!  As for toppings I kinda go light, but I do love the fresh fruit:  strawberries, mango, lychee, pineapple, and blueberries often end up at the party.  Yogurtland froyo makes a yum-yum in my tum-tum.\n\nThis newer place seems to always be busy - it is after all located in the same area as a Rubio's, Five Guys, and Firehouse Subs.  It's like a one-stop-shop for eats!  Yogurtland is situated right in the middle so it definitely capitalizes in some after meal dessert.  I can only suspect that Yogurtland will get busier as the good ol' Las Vegas summer heat rolls around.  \n\nAre you HOT?  Go to Yogurtland!  Not so HOT?  Go somewhere else.  Just kidding!  Yogurtland will give you healthy macrobiotic eats whether you're ugly or not!	4
This place is fairly new and right around the corner from me. I ordered the won ton soup as usual. It was excellent. (I always request extra cilantro - I no longer have to because they know now how I like it) The Hot Basil is pretty much my regular meal there. I ask for Thai hot and is usually comes just right. The cashew nut with chicken is very good as well. My wife got the pineapple fried rice. It was ok. Not my favorite fried rice. But what throws them over the top is they have Pepsi. Not Coke. Highly recommend this place as one of the best Thai in Gilbert.	4
"This review is for the lunch buffet.  Why 5 stars?\n\nNot only is it an excellent value for the money, but everything is fresh and delicious.  I am not an Indian food guy, so I don't know how authentic it is or how it compares to others...\n\nBut I will tell you, it will be hard finding a better way to spend the same money for lunch!  \n\nThe garlic naan bread was amazing...we ordered two baskets for the table and it was devoured quickly.  Some of the best \""bread\"" that I have had....so so good.\n\nI liked most of the dishes I tired, but a few of the meat dishes stood out, and were great to eat with the accompanying dipping sauces.  A few times the serving food went empty since it was very busy, but that meant fresh food was coming out within minutes.\n\nOnly bad thing....they were really busy...and it didn't look like their was much help on the floor.  The poor guy was literally running around in circles and was forgetting refills and pulling plates, but that was hardly enough for me to drop the review down a notch since it didn't ruin or affect our lunch here too much.\n\nI will be back again.  I say go for it, especially if you live on this side of town!"	4
Our water heater took a dump last night and I began my search on google. One company called me and quoted $2200 sight unseen. I panicked... no way were we spending that $ on a water heater. So I turned to YELP. Found a bunch of 5 star reviews for Water Heater Pros. I left a message and I got a call first thing in the morning. They set a  two-hour window for later in the day. Charlie was early and the crew was on-time and they completed the work in about 1.5hours. They quoted a great price- a really great price!!! and came through exactly as stated. Amazing knowledge and professionalism. It is nice to know there are service professionals out there that are honest and uphold great work ethics. Thank you to Water Heater Pros. I will be happy to recommend them in the future.	4
"Think soup Nazi for Italian food.  You either love it or you hate it.  I think their modus operandi is to size up a table and treat you with an attitude.  If you have thick skin, will open your wallet, and are \""real\"" to them, they'll treat you like family; if not, they'll kick you out, as they did to a young couple next to us.\n\nI chose the Chilean sea bass with Ravioli and it was incredible.  Our waiter took shots with our table and our service and food were great.  It's a dining experience I recommend to anyone."	4
Cajun Filet biscuit a nice morning wake-me-up. Don't forget the honey and Cajun hot sauce!	4
One of my friends got a facial from Charlotte Plastic Surgery, first of all when she got in my car, I noticed that she looked really pretty before she even said anything..  then she said she went to CPS for a facial.  She said, that she scraped her face with a razor and got all the dead skin off.  Stop right there.  I want my face free of dead skin.\n\nSo, I made an appointment and went today..  egads, loved it..  I am very no nonsense, I like to cut right to the chase.  Going to a surgeon's office is not for relaxation, they mean business!!!  Love, love, love!!!  \n\nMelody scrubbed my face with a soft rotary Sonic brush, scraped off dead skin, then did this oxygen treatment on me to calm my red face. The treatment was wet and cold, it felt better than the mister at Disneyworld.  My first question was, when can I come back?\n\nIt seems like most Yelpers are young and you aren't worried about your skin, but please take care of it, start wearing sunscreen daily, don't forget about your hands and neck too.  Your hands really are the first to show age.. Sunscreen my friends.\n\nBoys this isn't for girls only, everyone would love to get their face scrubbed, believe me!!!\n\nMelody!!  Remember!!	4
I went in with embarrassing under arm hair.  I have dark hair and fair skin.  Even after shaving it looked like I needed to shave because you could see the underlining roots. I was skeptical about Ideal Image. I couldn't believe the results with just one treatment. They could stop treatment now and I would be happy with the results I have already gotten.  I am very excited to see the finished results. The treatment is exciting and exactly what I had hoped for.  I also want to talk about the staff. Everyone is so sweet, understanding, and caring. They have the best team working together to make sure your happy. They are truly wonderful. I look forward to seeing them. Thank you Ideal Image! You made me a believer!!	4
This is my favorite In-N-Out and the first one I ever visited. \n\nIt has the basic In-N-Out food. BUT...every. single. time. I come here everything is delicious. The fries are cooked to perfection, the burgers done perfectly, the service is snappy even when busy, and the shakes are creamy, delicious, and perfectly mixed. \n\nEvery time I'm in Vegas I have to eat at this In-N-Out, it just wouldn't be a trip to Vegas without it. They all should be this good.	4
This place is so unassuming and in a shopping center so you may never really put it on your list of places to go - but you SHOULD. The food is EXCEPTIONAL. The service is always wonderful. This is one of the places that could make it in a high traffic area/snooty location because of the food alone, but it's nice they are a neighborhood favorite. Seriously get the margarita pizza and the fettucini.	4
Service was fast and extremely friendly, coffee was great, and I will definitely return!\n\nI love that they have a little drive thru and they offer so many sugar free options.  It's a refreshing way to grab a drink anytime!	4

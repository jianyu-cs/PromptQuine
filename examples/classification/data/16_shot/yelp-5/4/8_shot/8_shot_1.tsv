(edited to tone it down)\n\nPros:\n\n- Pizza is great\n- Beer specials on Mondays are awesome.\n\nCon:\n\n- The restaurant can be a playground for screaming children. \n\nI'm just trying to eat, have a beer, talk, and watch the game. I don't want to deal with a bunch of screaming kids running all over the place and fighting over the arcade game in the corner. Even the great beer specials on Mondays are not worth listening to that. \n\nIt must be noted that there is only so much the management can do about other peoples' children. Their parents should manage the volume - but I think some just become habituated to it.\n\nMaybe it's not like that every night. But we have noticed it twice.\n\nIf you eat here, just ask to be seated in the corner farthest from the arcade game, unless you enjoy the sound of shrieking children after working all day.\n\nObviously, if you have kids, they're a family-friendly restaurant.	0
"REVIEW IS ON THE CLUB---\nWent to see Holly's Peep Show. Very nice, especially act 2 and the view from behind of Holly's BEHIND!\n\nKoi Club-\nGot wristbands from \""promoters\"" telling us that women are free with the wristband and I would pay but free drinks all night. \n\nWe got there and it ended up being 20 bucks cover for anyone and only women's drinks were free\n\nThe dance floor, seating area and bar area are about as big as my apartment. I actually might have a better VIP area. LOL -\nWay too many people for the amount of room. There were girls there with flipflops and t-shirts. Guys with running shoes and polo's. From the facade in front you can be led to believe this is an upscale place. It's more like a local bar with a decent DJ in a pretty box. \n\nTook the girls 15 mins to get drinks, then I had to go over to the other side of their small bar to clash with the restroom go-ers to get my 8-dollar beer. \n\nGo somewhere else. Maybe BANK or TRYST"	0
Okay.....read the other reviews about taking the scenic routes and making it a longer ride that wasn't a problem with this guy. I looked up the rates did the math myself it was a 9.6 mile trip the meter came out to what I got.....But I left my 350$ nikon camera in the cab. Called the company got in touch with the driver......he tried to extort money out me to bring me my camera are you fuckin serious?!? He wanted 70$. How about I call highway patrol tell them you stole my camera have them arrest you and tow the cab?!? He has a cleft lip cab number 558 and when he starts talking fast you can't understand anything he says. Will not use nellis cab company again next time I'm in vegas which was my first time going by the way cuz I turned 22 while I was on vacation there so choose someone else	0
Im giving it a 1 star but you may not all agree with that. If your a beetles fan you may love it. Other wise its a vomit of color and repetitive flips with annoying music that has long since been outdated. Yes Im sorry hipsters but we all have to admit that the beetles aren't as good as you claim they are. maybe in our parents generation. So if you a beetles fan or a hipster that pretends to be one go you may like it. If you are not STAY AWAY!!	0
Horrible food! I had the prime rib and it was overcooked and dry and I had the baked potato and it was hard! I could barely eat it. My wife had the country fried chicken which is a Vegas special and she said it was really chewy and gross. Never going there again. :(	0
"I used 1 of my 3 manicures that I bought on Groupon on this Friday 3/8/13.  Gary the nail tech used a clear gel and then nailpolish on top of it-  and he said that it would last for 2 weeks.  His polish was all over the sides of my nails and he said that would come out in the shower.  I left there disapointed that I had to go home and clean up my nails so that it didnt look like a 5 year old painted them.  Then I took a shower the next morning and my whole thumb nail -polish and gel - totally peeled off in 1 whole piece.  Thank god I used my own polish so that I could just paint it even though the \""Wonderful gel\"" he used had peeled off too.  Then yesterday by the end of the day 3 other nails of gel and polish had completely peeled off in one full piece.  I am not sure what products he uses -but it was horrible.  He was rude and even told me that someone called to complain that theirs chipped and he said \""too bad, I cant take you back for 2 weeks\"".  This is not someone I want to go back to considering the fact that it didnt even last for 24 hours when he said his products were so great they lasted for 2 weeks at a time.  He is a 1 man operation, so its not like I can go to someone else in the salon.  I still have 2 of these \""Gel manicures\"" that I have not used and would never go back there or sugest that any of my friends go there either."	0
well after my boyfriend JUST waited 45 minutes for a to go order, i think it safe to say we won't be trying this place again.  both of us work in restaurants and he's a manager at a bar right down the street from Half Shell, so he know's what a bartender looks like when she's forgotten to put in an order. and not only did she forget to put the order in but she forgot his meal all together. WONDERFUL. She did offer to have it made but he already sat there for 45 mins, what makes her think he's gonna sit there and wait again due to HER error. Thanks but No thanks. \n\nP.S their ceviche is HORRIBLE, no flavor and NO juice. If i had wanted chopped up shrimp,onions, jalapeno and tomatoes i would have just made it at home. \n\nvery disappointed in this place.	0
"I stopped in Urban Wax for an eye brow wax and met with quite possibly the most rude and confrontational person I've ever experienced in a professional setting named Sara.  I sat down and tried to explian to Sara the brow shape I wanted.  She kept drawing outlines on my brows that were completely opposite of what I described.  When i tried to explain again, she became ANGRY and said she knew what she was doing, that she was the \""expert\"".  When I told her that she was making me uncomfortable she quickly raised my chair for me to get up!  I told her she was being very inappropriate and she began to RAISE HER VOICE with me--to the point that one of the girls from a back room came out to see what was going on.  The recpetionist at the front desk, Jessica, was very quiet (though she heard everything that transpired), but polite and said she would have the owner call me.  Mean while, Sara sat in a chair trying to ARGUE that she didn't do anything wrong and that I was \""the inappropriate one\"".  I told her she was out of line speaking to a customer like this--she bobbed her head back and forth and just kept trying to engage me in a confrontation.  It was a surreal experience.  Would hate to have her come near me with hot wax.  I've read the reviews for Urban Wax and it looks like a nice salon, but they should seriously consider getting rid of people like this girl before more bad reviews start pouring in."	0
A bit overpriced ($90 / $85 with the Total Rewards card); and not a good return on that money.  We were here on 09/28/14 Sunday with a 12pm reservation.\n\nFirst of all, if you still decide to go, make your reservations for the earlier times (9:30am to 12pm), as they do tend to run out of the better things after 12pm.  You can sign up for the free Total Reward card at the Bally's hotel, where the buffet is at; located at the same BLT Steak restaurant; which turns into the steakhouse in the evenings.\n\nThe Pros:\nAYCE lobster, lamb chops, caviar, champagne, & king crab legs, and they give you a Popover at the beginning of the meal (but they ran out of them at around 1:30pm)\n\nThe Cons:\nThe lobster was a bit tough; and after around 1pm, instead of a whole lobster tail, they started putting out a half tail.  When we arrived at 12pm, we heard they had run out of oysters already.  The filet Mignon was just a small piece of meat in a small pan, not very tasty, actually kind of bland.  The nigiri sushi didn't look fresh; Genki sushi tasted better.  Lobster bisque (which you have to order from the waiter) was bland.  The service was also lacking; as our waiter catered to a certain table of 6, and pretty much ignored us.\n\nOverall; it's a quantity over quality.  We came for the AYCE lobster , filet Mignon, and crab, and the pictures here did look great.  But it was a disappointment.  For your money, find another buffet.  :(	1
Food was so so service slow. Servers don't pay attention. God awful ugly waitresses. Annoying crowd and unfriendly atmosphere is probably due to the demographic of the area. Buffalo chicken sandwich was ok. Side of fries should be bigger. Wouldn't recommend this location. The Chandler location was much better.	1
"Stayed here once.  And no joke, on my floor alone we saw police take down a group smoking dope in their room -- and also prostitutes walking around -- saying hello to us.  Yeah.  But other than that \""excitement\"" -- it was an enjoyable stay.  The casino is nice.  The location is a tad off The Strip, but not far.  Rates were extremely low -- probably because they make money off the prostitutes on the side!"	1
"I have heard lots of good stuff about this place so my expectaions were set high. \nThe morning we went was beautiful so we sat on the patio. It's a nice patio with a nice view of the area, but nothing extra special about it.\nWe really came to eat, and not realx but it was relaxing and service was pretty good too.\nThe menu seemed small to me, not a lot of options, but what was striking was the prices. This place is Very expencive, even for Scottsdale! a basic 2 egg, bacon, potato, and toast breakfast, inwich was on the small side is 10.50 almost everything eles cost more! and It seemed any little change or modification incured an \""up-charge\"" 1 dollar for jalepeno jelly... Really!!!! thats just the start.\nWhat was exceptional was the Buttermilk dill toast, by far the best toast I ever had! but when asked if they sell the bread to go I found out they do, but it's $12 a loaf. keep it.\nThe corn bread was just as yummy but they make you pay for the jalepeno jelly, $1 for an ounce, YIKES!\nDotties is \""good\"" but for the prices, either the portions need to be improved, or stop nickle and diming for extras. For now I'm eating at other places.\nThis corner has been lots of things, restaurants seem to come and go here, I wonder who or what will be next, as I dont think this place has staying power."	1
Standard food as with all locations. It was the service that ruined it when the order taker became so frustrated by me not wanting the drink that came with the kids meal. He was flustered and rude like I was inconveniencing him because we had our own water. It's 110 degrees out. \n\nAnyway, at least it was clean and the food filled us up.	1
pricey for a breakfast spot, and food was not spectacular.	1
"Normally I would give this a higher rating because I have never experienced a problem here like I did today. The food was fine, but the girl  that gives you the food was very rude. I ordered a baked potato and when it came up she gave me one butter and one sour cream. I gave her the sour cream back and said I needed alot of butter. So she hands me one more, I said again, I need alot of butter, so she hands me one more(now I have 3). I looked at her and said how many more can I have? So she hands me two more(5) and smart's off \""if you need anymore, I will have to charge you for them\"". WTH? Really?? It's a small pat container of butter. I have NEVER been charged for them in any of the Showmars restaurants. And usually they give me so many I have to take some back. She acted like I was taking something personally from her. I can understand with the dressings, if you get more than 2 they charge you. But this is butter for crying out loud. That's like charging for ketchup packs. \""Some\"" people just don't need to be out front in a customer service setting. Maybe the back area is more her speed."	1
I'm from pig country, Eastern North Carolina.\n\nWhile I'm now a vegetarian, back in the day when I worked across the street, my coworkers ranted and raved about this joint. So naturally, I had to check it out.\n\nThis is not real barbeque....I would never pay $15 for real barbeque either.\nI should have ran when I saw queso on the menu.\n\nIf you're in town on business and you're from the midwest, this place might be fantastic! But if you're used to smoking a pig in your backyard and dousing it in vinegar or going to a mom and pop shop that hasn't been updated since the '70's you won't like it.\n\nI only had the barbeque here once and it was severely under-seasoned. The service wasn't extraordinary either. \n\nIt's mediocre, that's all I can say.\n\nWith that being said, BBQ King off Wilkinson is said to be some of the best 'que in the Queen City. And honestly, I prefer Cookout's bbq over Queen City Que's. \n\nIf you're uptown and looking for barbeque, don't. Unfortunately this is not where they serve the good stuff.	1
"I like their coffee - they have one of the better lattes in town (I like a couple other places in Champaign downtown as well). I appreciate their establishment being here in Urbana downtown. Thank you. \n\nHowever, I wish they would work on improving their service and treatment of their customers a little bit. Being \""super hipster\"" does not and should not equal to bad service (..right?). One time, my order failed to go through, and when I approached them about 15 minutes later asking about my coffee, the barista at the time did not even apologize to me -- she snorted. They make good coffee, but sometimes I find myself not looking forward to going here because of the anticipated interaction with some of their pompous staff."	2
"-------------\nThe Quick:\n-------------\n\nGood, but not great, contemporary American fare that is served in a setting and demeanor too casual to be called fine-dining. \n\n-------------\nThe Details:\n-------------\n\nDuring my latest outing to Las Vegas, I was searching for a new fine-dining restaurant to try. To my disappointment, I was not encouraged by any of the new offerings and decided that I would go with a repeat visit to the current fine-dine Vegas champ restaurant Alex (see my review for more details). Unfortunately, I was greatly saddened by the fact that Alex had recently closed! I could not find a clear answer to why it had closed as it attracted a fair amount of diners and was not lacking in the recognition department (2-star Michelin). Nonetheless, I was left in the situation where I had to \""settle\"" for one of the new fine-dine establishments I have yet to try over the last year or two. \n\n...which leads me to Sage. As alluded to in Vegas dining magazines and articles I had read on the web, it appears hotel owners (like Wynn/Encore) believe that most Vegas visitors do not hover toward traditional, intimate, true fine-dining environments. They believed they could attract the most customers via establishments that had good food, but a more relaxed, hip, and glamorous (showy) experience. My opinion on this school of though set aside, it basically left me no choice but to pick a restaurant that was not as fine-dine as I originally wanted. With the exception of Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon, there are really no more true fine-dine establishments in Las Vegas (at least that i know of). \n\nAnyways, here are the concrete details of my dining experience at Sage:\n\n1) Food - I didn't care for the offered tasting menu and to my surprise, not everyone at the table had to have the tasting menu. Consequently my gf got the tasting menu as I elected to pick off the a la carte menu.\n\na) Appetizer #1: Pacific Yellow Tail Crudo w/ shaved trumpet mushrooms, black winter truffle, and toasted pine nuts\n-I'm always a fan of raw fish and especially yellow tail so this dish was a no-brainer for me. The tangy citrus marinade worked well with the inherent flavor of the fish. However, I was not a fan of the shaved (raw) mushroom and felt it did not blend with the other ingredients of the dish. \n\nb) Appetizer #2: Chilled Dungeness Crab Salad with fennel, tangerine, and creme fraiche\n-Again, another favorite classic ingredient of mine: crab. Good flavors, probably my favorite dish of the night. Very delicate, mild tastes in the salad. Not overpowering but just the right amount of flavor to not mask the sweetness of the crab meat. \n\nc) Entree: Bluenose Grouper with chanterelles, leeks, parsley root\n-Why did I get this dish? Why didn't I go for the kobe? Yeah, I have no idea actually. In hindsight, I should have gone for the bold flavors of the meat dishes and skipped the fish. The grouper was okay, but did not stand out at all. It had some decent flavor and was of course cooked perfectly. It was strictly ordinary and ordinary was not something one looks for in such a high-end establishment. \n\n2) Service - subpar in the context of true fine-dining establishments. Our waiter did not do anything especially wrong or was especially rude, but like a lot of the other components of this restaurant, he was merely okay. I could not differentiate whether the waiter simply had a natural, apathetic demeanor or he did want to serve us. In either case, however, his bored, casual affect immediately disappointed my dining experience. \n\nOverall, Sage was a forgettable restaurant in a slew of similar, high-end, but ordinary Las Vegas restaurants. Sure, it was pretty good food overall, but you honestly find good food like that in almost any other 4/5 star hotel in Vegas. There was nothing that made it stand out from the competition nor did it possess a theme, trait, dish, or element of service that compels me to return."	2
Not been to All Bar One in a very long time. I do like the decor inside, and service was very good.I think the trick us to go when it is quiet as I've been here on saturday night and been three people deep to get to the bar for a drink!. Sunday to Wednesday they have cocktails for \u00a3 4.50! Which is popular! it's not my favourite on George street but I would go back and they seem to have plenty promotions on!	2
Went for a business lunch, the decor is nice, servers were attentive.  I got a my fish broiled and it was a bit soggy, but tasted alright.  Want to give this place another try as this time wasn't spectacular, but wasn't bad.	2
I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it was sooooo salty that it was almost painful to eat. I'm not sure what went wrong, but it was definitely done wrong. It's been a long time since we've been here and I don't remember the eggplant being this bad the last time. I doubt we'll go here anytime soon for food, but the bar area is cozy and relaxing.	2
Love the lunch specials.  The food and service is average.  I don't get all the menu's though.  We went for lunch the other day and we were each given 5 different menus with different items on them-to only find out that we actually had a few were different.  It was confusing and a little ridiculous.	2
"Average is what comes to mind about this place. Decent selection and clean enviroment. Nothing special about the atmosphere. Usually pretty empty inside. I do like the fast and courteous service. It's a good spot for quick lunch while at work.\n\ni've never really tried their \""chinese-style\"" entrees, but they looked too greasy for me to be appetizing. Sushi was average, not too fresh, but not terrible. Deserts (frozen peach sorbet) was yummy, albeit a bit frozen.\n\nOverall, just an average sushi place. Okay for lunch if you work near-by, but otherwise, go somewhere else."	2
Time to update this review.  I often need to send out packages via FedEx and these little stores help me do that.  2 yrs ago, I had a bad experience with an employee.  Since most employees who work in places like this don't stay very long, I knew he wouldn't be around for very long.  After about 6 months, I went back to use this location and he was in fact no longer working there...good.\n\nNow I use this place form time to time to send out packages or faxes when I'm out of the office.  Easy to use their services and their location is convenient to restaurants and bars.  What more can I ask for?\n\nReturn Factor - 75%	2
"The BFs coworker is a bit of a foodie and declared this to be his favorite over the other AYCEs, even better than our favorite haunt. We were in the area and decided to go for dinner at $26.95 pp.\n\n-NIGIRI-\n\n*Albacore- even though it just says plain, it kinda comes slightly like \""cajun albacore\"" that other sushi spots do. It has a bit of pepper, thin slice of jalapeno and ponzu. It was pretty tasty and fresh so we ordered quite a bit. \n*Super White Tuna- was pretty fresh\n*Yellowtail- decent, but not as fresh as other ayces I've had.\nSpicy Octopus- this is a mix of thin sliced sweet vinegared tako, jalapeno, masago...must for the fans of tako no sunomono.\n(Seared Pepper baby tuna- this was peppered tuna that was freshly torched. I like this kind of stuff, but the BF thought the sear makes it a bit chewy.\n*Mackerel- This was totally the star and what impressed me the most. Every have mackerel where it is just kinda dry, fishy, and very salty? Not here. It was fresh cut off a fish and not bought salt packed/salt cured. I almost never order this since it rarely gives me satisfaction...I got several orders. I have not been this pleased with mackerel aside from sashimi I had at Ichiza. The chef puts ponzu on it which makes sense to me since at home I squeeze lemon on mine and soy and helps a lot of people with the strong flavors, but if you want it pure make sure to opt for dry. It was amazing alone with some fresh wasabi. \n* Sashimi Yellowtail...odd, but these pieces tasted better than the nigiri. \n* Sashimi Albacore w/ Jalapeno- it was rolled with thin sliced red onion as well which gave a nice bite to it. \n\n-ROLLS-\n\n*Salmon Skin handroll- it's a comfort staple I end every AYCE meal with. Love. \n*Albacore Crunch- this was spicy tuna roll with albacore topped with sweet onion fried onion strings with a spicy garlic ponzu. The fried onions wasn't what I was expecting when the BF said it has \""crunchies\"" and made for nice texture and a bit of a sweet flavor element. \n\nWe're not big on rolls, but some perked out interest. However we were too full for more. \n\n-APPETIZERS-\n\n*Monkey Brain- mushroom with tuna and creamcheese fried and served with a spicy cream sauce. This was really good, with a lot going on that went well together, but I can still taste the separate elements. \n*Softshell crab- I love these things. Poor crabs. I must have had 10 of them. \n*Hamachi Kama- it was fresh fish. I think Island Sushi down the street takes the prize though since they cook theirs much longer which makes for crispy skin. There were parts of this skin that was just fatty and rubbery still so I left it alone. \n*Butter Saute Scallop- it comes on a hot plate in butter and herbs. They weren't rubbery or overcooked. This is a very plain app, but good to me. Sometimes I just want scallops simple. I put a tiny bit of soy into the mix and it was some good little bites.\n*Kalbi Ribs- these were cooked on a hot plate. They were pretty soft and had decent flavors\n*Firecracker- wonton crackers with tuna, avocado with spicy sauce and a sweet kinda honey sesame sauce. I liked these, they did get pretty spicy- fire cracker indeed!\n\nWe ended with green tea tempura ice cream and mango mochi. I don't get why they put chocolate sauce on my mango mochi...its best to leave a good thing alone so maybe tell them to lay off the sauce. Also was limit one contrary to a earlier review by Patrick D. stating no limit.\n\n-SERVICE-\nOur sushi chef was nice, the owner (also working at the sushi bar, on the other side) came to check on us and even the sushi chef working aside the one in front of us also checked on us. Food came out in a good amount of time even though they were busy. The servers cleared plates fast! I mean sometimes I would be trying to move a plate out of the way and there's someones hand grabbing at it nearly missing a few degrees of me being doused in sauce. However, I'd turn around to ask for some appetizers and they're gone off. Someone snuck in hands to refill drinks fast as well. They didn't really check on us to see if we needed stuff from the kitchen so we flagged down if we wanted stuff. Then when we were ready for dessert, we were ignored when we asked and our sushi chef was too who shouted and pointed to us saying \""Dessert\"". And it wasn't because they were busy, in fact, 4 of them were standing by us or milling about picking up an order. We were held hostage for a bit til I was able to catch someones attention. It was just very odd front of the house service. Also, the ladies weren't very personable, one even seemed a bit cranky at how \""big\"" our orders are which was polarities different from the cheerful sushi men. I wouldn't put several orders if I didn't think it was so hard to put in a order.\n\nOverall- I think this is a good place with the nicest ambiance and pretty plating. I get why the BFs coworker recommended it. However, my favorite place still remains because of the awesome service on both sides of the bar."	3
Great Monday special (cheeseburger & fries). Customer service always good. Owner even checks in with patrons.	3
I was there last week with some friends for happy hour. They have margaritas $1 off and 1/2 price appetizers. The blueberry margarita was delicious!	3
I feel as though this place needs a little more love.  First of all, its nice to go to a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Szechuan food.  If you haven't had food from this region of China, it kind of like comfort food.  It tends to be spicy and, yes, a little oily some times.  Most of the spicy dishes are also complimented by the nice floral flavor of ash berry, also know as Szechuan peppercorn.  Some people have complained about oil but when I have not ordered the spicy and hot, the food has been less oily than most places.  Everything I have tried, I have enjoyed.	3
Had a blast with my fiance. \nWent to the arcade had a blast.\nGot the most prizes in my life.\nShopping there can make you gk broke cause theres just way to many cute stores with to many cute items lol\nCool show different and free everytime cant beat it.\nGet a nice tall margeritra and have fun	3
I bought my bike here maybe 2 years ago. Anytime I come in for something, they are super cool and friendly.\nI have dropped my bike off twice to have stuff done to it, and the guy has always offered to bring me my bike up at my work. I dont know if this is a normal thing they do, but RAD none the less!	3
"Pricing wasn't bad at all,  because it was ladies night.  \n\nShooters world is relatively close to our house.  My Wife  has been wanting to go shooting for a while now.  Being that it was Valentines Day and we've done all of the commercial events over the years, I thought to break up the mundane. It was ladies night, so we only paid for my weapon rental and both of our ammo.  It was a great hour spent hitting our targets and learning about gun safety.  \n\nMy only con is that the customer service isn't the best.  When our time was done instead of politely communicating that... this guy basically told us to leave. \""Your hour is up, Y'all need to hurry up or pay for another hour\"" We were already packed up with case's in hand. Which is why is comment was confusing. \n\nOther than that, it was a great time!  We'll definitely go back!"	3
Pleasantly surprised by the friendliness, cleanliness, and all the amenities for the price. Jennifer even called someone on her cell phone to find out the closest favorite Burger joint (In N Out for me, Rally's for my wife) and everyone working there was most hospitable, all of 5 minutes from Sky Harbor, cannot be beat for the price	3
"Agree with everybody who gave 5 stars: \""The BEST Japanese food in Arizona.\"" \""It's a no nonsense ma & pa kind of place with good food.\"" \n\nThey provide good size portions and are inexpensive.  I like the katsudon."	4
Yum. Thank you yelpers. I was so excited about trying this place, but was worried that my expectations would be too high after hearing all then praise. Luckily, this place is not overrated! \n\nPapaya Pad Thai, a delightful spin on traditional noodle dish. I don't think I ever want it any other way. The Tom Yum soup was so wonderful. These were my two favorite dishes. I've had better Duck Curry, but it was a solid dish nonetheless. Same for the Deep Fried Catfish with Green Chilies.\n\nI'll definitely be a regular here! =)	4
"This review is for the lunch buffet.  Why 5 stars?\n\nNot only is it an excellent value for the money, but everything is fresh and delicious.  I am not an Indian food guy, so I don't know how authentic it is or how it compares to others...\n\nBut I will tell you, it will be hard finding a better way to spend the same money for lunch!  \n\nThe garlic naan bread was amazing...we ordered two baskets for the table and it was devoured quickly.  Some of the best \""bread\"" that I have had....so so good.\n\nI liked most of the dishes I tired, but a few of the meat dishes stood out, and were great to eat with the accompanying dipping sauces.  A few times the serving food went empty since it was very busy, but that meant fresh food was coming out within minutes.\n\nOnly bad thing....they were really busy...and it didn't look like their was much help on the floor.  The poor guy was literally running around in circles and was forgetting refills and pulling plates, but that was hardly enough for me to drop the review down a notch since it didn't ruin or affect our lunch here too much.\n\nI will be back again.  I say go for it, especially if you live on this side of town!"	4
Our water heater took a dump last night and I began my search on google. One company called me and quoted $2200 sight unseen. I panicked... no way were we spending that $ on a water heater. So I turned to YELP. Found a bunch of 5 star reviews for Water Heater Pros. I left a message and I got a call first thing in the morning. They set a  two-hour window for later in the day. Charlie was early and the crew was on-time and they completed the work in about 1.5hours. They quoted a great price- a really great price!!! and came through exactly as stated. Amazing knowledge and professionalism. It is nice to know there are service professionals out there that are honest and uphold great work ethics. Thank you to Water Heater Pros. I will be happy to recommend them in the future.	4
Cajun Filet biscuit a nice morning wake-me-up. Don't forget the honey and Cajun hot sauce!	4
I went in with embarrassing under arm hair.  I have dark hair and fair skin.  Even after shaving it looked like I needed to shave because you could see the underlining roots. I was skeptical about Ideal Image. I couldn't believe the results with just one treatment. They could stop treatment now and I would be happy with the results I have already gotten.  I am very excited to see the finished results. The treatment is exciting and exactly what I had hoped for.  I also want to talk about the staff. Everyone is so sweet, understanding, and caring. They have the best team working together to make sure your happy. They are truly wonderful. I look forward to seeing them. Thank you Ideal Image! You made me a believer!!	4
This is my favorite In-N-Out and the first one I ever visited. \n\nIt has the basic In-N-Out food. BUT...every. single. time. I come here everything is delicious. The fries are cooked to perfection, the burgers done perfectly, the service is snappy even when busy, and the shakes are creamy, delicious, and perfectly mixed. \n\nEvery time I'm in Vegas I have to eat at this In-N-Out, it just wouldn't be a trip to Vegas without it. They all should be this good.	4
This place is so unassuming and in a shopping center so you may never really put it on your list of places to go - but you SHOULD. The food is EXCEPTIONAL. The service is always wonderful. This is one of the places that could make it in a high traffic area/snooty location because of the food alone, but it's nice they are a neighborhood favorite. Seriously get the margarita pizza and the fettucini.	4

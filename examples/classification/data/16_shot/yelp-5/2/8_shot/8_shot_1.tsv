"Shame on Maria and Kings Appliance. One star is too many for this place. Maria in the office can't be trusted and was not accountable for her mistakes. It began when I filed a home warranty claim and Kings took two business days to call me back. When I finally spoke to someone to schedule the appointment, I was told the technician will arrive between 10am-2pm, and the call ended. So I expected a knock on the door or a ring of the bell between 10am-2pm- I purposely had someone at the residence waiting for Kings arrival. 1pm rolled around and I received two voicemails during a meeting stating that since I've missed their call, the appointment is now cancelled. The fact is, I was NOT told to expect a call prior to the techs arrival. Kings never even asked for my number because if they had asked, knowing I'd be busy all day, I would've provided the number to the person so kindly waiting at the home. Maria was unapologetic for the mess, condescending and flat out lied about the phone call stating, \""now you know we always call prior to arrival\"". Excuse me- I know? How the heck am I to know this important piece of info? I do not work there, I've not ever used this company before and I was never told to expect a call. And why would the office call prior to the arrival as opposed to the tech? Maria was nasty, not empathetic for her mistake and the frustration that it caused. She's a liar, unprofessional and deserves every piece of karma coming her way. And the service contract she has with the home warranty co. should be cancelled and shredded out of common decency to the paying clients of the home warranty company that must deal with such childish behavior."	0
If you're into the very loud electronic music club vibe on the water and care not for quality of food and drink then this is your place. I'm not sure who in my partner's family picked this place for a wedding rehearsal dinner, but I feel like I should blame the wedding planner who missed a lot of details re the wedding itself (then I can keep the blame outside the family).\n\nWe were trying to have a dining/family/celebration experience in a restaurant, but it felt like a nightclub. And the food was insultingly terrible. Who's this Apollo guy? Hopefully not a famous chef. OK, so the food was edible. Nothing was inedible. But it should have been WAY better for the price. I make better risotto in my sleep.\n\nAnother waterfront/riverfront place that thinks it doesn't have to be good because it attracts business based on its location alone. I'd avoid.	0
Horrible. I'm pretty sure everything came out of a bag. Chips were stale and I've had better cheese at a truck stop push spout. I'm not sure how they made the guacamole, but I'm certain there wasn't any avocado in there. Extra bonus - everything was served cold.	0
Overpriced. Greasy. Not good.  What wasn't greasy was too salty. My first and last experience with dim sum. I would have rather set my hard earned $$ on fire.	0
This place is THE WORST. They have the most unfriendly, unhelpful, unknowledgable staff I've ever come across. I went in to buy some new coils and after me telling them I had a mini pro tank 2 and them personally looking at it, they sold me the wrong coils. Accidents happen right? I went back not 15 minutes after buying them to get properly fitting coils and they tried to refuse me a refund and were genuinely rude about the whole situation. I just wanted proper coils, not a refund, which I had already explained. However, they were still demanding that I pay for the bad ones they sold me in the first place. After trying to do fucking calculus with these people about refunds and replacement I finally got some coils that fit.... Only to find out that they were bad, didn't work, and shorted my battery. I gave up. \n\nRude staff that know nothing about vapes. \nPoor business practices. \nNon-functioning products. \n\nVape stores are popping up all over the city, we don't have to support one that doesn't function properly.	0
"Even though this is the place to go to when in Vegas, it was definitely not the place for me & my group of friends. We came here back in March. Our friend had a \""hook up\"" that got us in for free, but the place was so damn crowded that it took us 2 hours to walk through the whole place! Drinks were freaking expensive, and there was barely any room to stand. My friends managed to get a corner by the bar, but they were constantly spilling their drinks because there were 2 single file lines of people trying to get by and pushing. I've never been claustrophobic before, but this place definitely brought that out in me!\n\nWe stood by the bar area for about 10 minutes and decided it was too hot and stuffy, so we all left. Took us about another 45 minutes just to get OUT of the club!"	0
"DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL UNLESS YOU ARE A TRUST FUND BABY!!!!!!!!!!\nI would NOT recommend taking clasees to start your own business at this school. The office staff  is NOT transparent  at all about what ACTUALLY happens to the majority of the students here: unemployed, unable to run a business off what people are actually willing to pay for hypnotherapy and \""nutritional counseling\"" this school does not license people to do anything special at all and I am COMPLETELY sick at the thought of what they are brainwashing students with that does NOT actually prepare them for the REAL WORLD in this economy. I am working in a retail store after obtaining my \""degree\"" and struggling to pay my student loans off. The \""degree\"" is WORTHLESS. The education may be adequate but I know at least 3 dozen SWIHA students working at banks and businesses totally unrelated to health care. I couldnt even get hired in a doctor's office as a receptionist with this crapole degree. Do not go here unlesss you have rich parents or a rich husband that has thousands of dollars to give you for about five years to start a wellness business in a major recession."	0
The lines around dinner and lunch time are always colossal, almost equally so to some of the people standing in them.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of food available here when I managed to finally get in. I guess my choosiness allowed me to luck out and grab the best parts of the meatloaf and pot roast. However, even considering this, the foods seem to contain very high levels of salt. I had four glasses of water by the time I was done with my meal.\n\nThe service isn't bad for such a prodigiously crowded eatery but I won't be coming back until I hear about their food improving.\n\nBut, hey, at least it's cheap. It's dirt cheap compared to many restaurants in the area, although you can't expect too much.	1
"With little or no time left before I had to head to see \""O\"", I grabbed a quick bite at Snack Bar. I got a bit nervous at first because the line was so so so long, but it move very quickly. They must have it down to a science. You are in and out (ordering your food that is) within ten minutes. Pretty good for a non-fast-food eatery. The only down size of it being so packed, was that there was really no place to sit. Thankfully, I got my order just as a couple was leaving, so I was able to sit for five minutes to scarf down my food. Speaking of the food. It was decent. Not the worst, but defiantly not the best (especially in this town). I had a simple grilled chicken with salsa and guacamole. The chicken was a bit dry and spicy and the guacamole was average."	1
This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels.	1
Stayed here on two different occasions. The first was in the West Tower. Clean & remodeled. The second was in the Casino Tower. One word: COCKROACH. It also smelled strongly of detergent and the carpet was worn and badly stained.\n\nI did like that there were shops and many places to dine at. Also, another plus was the large variety of slot machines.\n\nIf you want to avoid all the children, go while school is in session. We last stayed here in early November and it was really mellow.	1
This is a very clean very nice establishment. They're staff is super cool, prolly the best staff in town. However, their prices are absolutely ridiculous. They are really taking advantage of people that either can't grown their own or are desperate to not be in pain. Either way the prices are the highest I've seen anywhere here in the AZ.	1
"Once again, I find myself stunned by the difference in my experience and that of other reviewers.   There is no way this was even a three star experience for our company of three.  Saba's is a pretty restaurant, but that's where the good review ends.\n\nWe arrived at dinner time on a Sunday.   I can't say that we felt very welcomed.  \n\nThere was one large table of customers and one small booth, so the restaurant was not very busy.   I had the feeling that the large table may have been family.   They received all the attention of the staff, leaving us feeling as though we'd crashed a private event.  \n \nWe had to wait for someone to seat us while being studiously ignored by the staff that was in the restaurant when we arrived.   There's nothing worse to me than knowing that someone is aware of your presence,  but won't even look in your direction .  A smile, a quick \""someone will be with you\"", any acknowledgement is so much better than being obviously ignored.   It's not as though the restaurant was full.\n\nThe service was ok.  Although we ordered a sharing platter for appetizers, we had to ask for extra plates. The ordering process was disjointed, the host asked us for our drink order as an afterthought, and then forgot to bring them.  \n\nWe found the food to be pretty bland.   The hummus and eggplant were completely unseasoned.  For the first time ever in a Mediterranean restaurant we added salt, due to the lack of acid in the preparation.   It's probably a good thing that we weren't crazy about the appetizer platter, since it was pretty sparse.   The saganaki arrived with none of the usual fanfare, or flavor.  It was just a salty crusty overcooked piece of cheese that hardened into a tough and chewy texture more like a jerky than anything else. \n\n The fattoush salad was also low on seasoning.   No kick whatsoever.    I have no idea what they used to dress the salad, but it just wasn't very good.   I was very disappointed, since fatthoush is usually one of my favorites.  This one just seemed slick with flavorless dressing.   The same for the dolmas, which had a dubious texture and very little flavor.   I think  the chef could use an introduction to that lovely assistant known as a lemon. \n\nThe spanikopita and tsatsiki were pretty good and the chicken kabob platter that included attractive looking grilled vegetables was nicely cooked, but also no seasoning.    \n\nAlthough we only ordered appetizers, salad and one entree between 3 of us, we left a lot of food on the plates.    \n\nWe were scouting the area prior to a re-location, but Saba's will not be one of the spots we'll be looking forward to revisiting."	1
Not the worst by far from the best. If your name has the main dish in it you better stand out from everyone else including Mc Donald's pushing the same thing, especially if you're gonna overcharge. \nNot consistent enough for me to go back a fourth time.\nSorry guys find some other sucker to pay your rent.\nIf my fellow yelpers must go here to get ur poutin fix keep it simple, and whatever you do stay away from the braised beef!!!\nI don't know what that animal was, but it wasn't no cow!	1
used to be my heaven on earth - but not the same now as under new management/ ownership. Still got a nice covered front terrace to sit outside.	1
Silky noodles, perfectly yolky eggs, but a salty broth..I was so excited to eat at this restaurant, but was a little disappointed. I couldn't finish my soup, perhaps because I added mustard greens. Points on the poached egg.. the best excuse for high cholestrol out there! It's right next to Raku.	2
I have yet to have a 5 star experience here to date.  Can't believe this place is rated this highly.  I've been trying to give them a chance to impress me since they first opened their doors but so far it's nothing but very average Mexican food.  Before writing this review I thought I'd visit them one more time since it had been awhile. Maybe somethings changed I thought.  Nope...still extremely average and not worth driving cross town for but if you're in the area and hungry then go for it.  Yesterdays choice was a carnitas burro and a order of super nachos.   My biggest problem with my two choices yesterday and with every visit I've ever made here is there is just not much flavor to the food.  In my opinion you can usually judge a Mexican food place by the salsa that arrives with your chips before you order. If they can't make a good salsa you can pretty much be assured the rest of your experience will match the salsa experience.  That being said this place has the most flavorless salsa I've ever tasted.	2
OK... I've had two experiences... one for Shutters through House of Window Coverings and one for draperies and roman shades that are Costco purchases that are handled through house of Window Coverings.\n\nThe SHUTTERS ARE A 5 STAR EXPERIENCE. The Costco purchase has been a ZERO star purchase. All in all it will average out at a 3. It's too bad, Christopher and the Norman Shutter team really deserved 5 stars!\n\nBottom line, Christopher was terrific. We were on a very tight time deadline and he not only met it, but he helped make it happen. I had called the week before we needed them and were told they were scheduled to arrive the next week. Normally they wait until they have shutters in hand before they schedule installation - however, HWC requested that we get installation the day after they arrived and they made it happen.\n\nGreat work by House of Window Coverings on making the shutters happen!  \n\nAs for the draperies and roman shades, more than THREE WEEKS LATE and we still don't have them.....	2
Comfy couches & low lighting really had me excited as we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary.  The music was okay but as soon as we ordered with a groupon for two Headhunter drinks the server couldn't be bothered.  Even though we had planned to order more we couldn't even get her attention to get a bill which we would have at least give her a tip.  I read the other reviews and had great expectations - maybe we should have sat inside where we could have tried various drinks.	2
I can tell this place is managed well.  \n\nThe food & service was good.  It just wasn't my thing.	2
This place is cool to go to if you have some down time in vegas and you don't want to go to a casino. You'll find a lot o character t-shirts and memorabilia from Disneyland . I like to go here to look for grumpy shirts for my mom and to see if maybe they have any of the disney antenna toppers. The prices are a little cheaper than the disney store, though sometimes it's hard to tell.  If you're every in need of some disney stuff at a decent price, skip the disney store and come here first!	2
Believe it or not, this was my first time.\n\nThe place is nice, the service kind of hit and miss and the food pretty average. \n\nGood thing they have a vast selection of sauces so there are options as long as you like wings.\n\nNothing impressive but a fair place to have a quick bite.\n\nTuesday and Thursday they have wing specials.\n\nEnjoy	2
I needed to kill some time before catching a flight back home and Memphis BBQ is conveniently near the McCcarran airport car rental facility. \n\nMy order the combo lunch with baby back ribs, hot links, Mac and cheese, baked beans and a diet Pepsi.  Overall the food was just OK. The stand out was the baked beans - delish flavor with several types of beans made this a stand out. The ribs were just average - dry and flavor less. I had to add BBQ sauce to make em edible. Links were just eh and the Mac and cheese was flat!\n\nWhat was solid here was the service from my waitress Carrie. Very accommodating and whe made sure everything was good throughout my entire lunch. For her efforts I raised the overall rating of this review.\n\nWill I return here? Possibly but I'll try different items next time.	2
Wow, I guess I'm the first to weigh in on this place. This place was recommended by a local friend for a nice steak house for locals. He was so right on. This place is a little old school with steaks, seafood and sides that do not require one take out a mortgage to cover the check. Must be me (or the economy), but I am getting tired of paying $60 for an ala carte steak in Vegas. Anyway, the filet was stellar. My husbands giant rib eye with perfect and the service and cocktails were great. Quiet, peaceful retreat from the busy casino and an all around good restaurant and steakhouse. Decor not dazzling like some of the higher end steakhouses, but still enjoyed the painted panoramas that constantly changed with the lighting and the soft cushy booth under my behind.	3
Best wings you will find in Mesa! The wings are always so fresh and so hot! The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5  is because they need to work on their customer service. The girls who used to work the drivethru were rude at times, but this new girl they have is great, she remembers my order every time I pull up to the drive thru ha ha, goes to show how often I am there! Also, if you are short on time, I recommend that you call ahead. The drivethru process can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes, not good when you want something quick! Overall, you should definitely visit!	3
This is typically the Walmart location I end up at based on convenience. \n\nThe service is typically good and the lines can be busy on weekends during peak times, but for the most part, the store keeps their lines to a minimum by opening more registers when they are busiest. This is especially helpful during he holidays. I recently noticed the signs at the registers saying they will open a new register any time there are more than three people in the line waiting.\n\nThey keep a good amount of stock on the shelves and they are clean and organized as well.	3
Good food, competent staff.  Omelets made with egg whites so a little healthier then most.	3
While there's no shortage of NAPA locations in the East Valley, this is probably my favorite. They've got friendly, knowledgeable staff and easily the best selection of in-stock products of all the locations.\n\nThey're also open generous hours on Sunday, making this location one of the few NAPAs where you can get parts and advice seven days a week.	3
Love this location, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and I am always very pleasantly surprised at my total when I'm being rung up.\n\nThe only negative is that they cut it really really close with their expiration dates.  I can see the value in not throwing away food, but no one wants something that expires that day or the next day, especially when I'm shopping for the week.  I've even found things that have already expired on the shelves. I try to shop on Mondays or Tuesdays because that's when they seem to refresh their stocks but they could really work on not having expired/close to expired food on the shelves.\n\nOverall though, great store!	3
Pork was well seasoned and marinated. \nPresentation was good and taste was good.\nPrices where great and the quantity could have been more.\nService was polite and quick.	3
Parking is tough, the food selection is great, and if you call ahead they will set aside awesome moving boxes for you.	3
"It's always a treat to visit Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails, whether you're feasting on innovative creations by Chef Stephen Jones, who pours love into every dish, or sipping on one of the delicious handcrafted cocktails for happy hour. I was invited to try some of the newest offerings on Jones' current spring/summer menu, made with organic and locally sourced ingredients that perfectly complement each other for a symphony in your mouth.\n\nThis meal (thank you to J. Lauren PR for the invitation), my pal Elle and I grabbed a seat outside on the patio, overlooking CityScape in downtown Phoenix.\n\nNot only was the weather perfect, we could hear tunes from neighboring Copper Blues. Like Elle pointed out, the music was great because it provided great background melodies that allowed us to still hear what each other was saying.\n\nLike all my visits at Blue Hound, the service, from the hostess to every single server who visited our table (including the knowledgeable and friendly Justis), was top-notch. Kudos to Blue Hound for properly training their staff in menu proficiency and professionalism.\n\nWe started with two delicious drinks - the Singapore Sling ($10) was made with Arizona Distilling Co. gin, B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and Cherry Heering liqueur. Justis told us the drink is modeled after original Tiki drinks, and we both agreed the balance of sweet and sour was great\n\nI also got the Lost Melody ($10), a frothy concoction with Smirnoff vodka, grapefruit liquer, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, and rose flower water. It tasted like dessert in a drink, which was totally fine with me, and I loved inhaling the coconut scents with every tasty sip.\n\nMy pal and I split a ton of plates, perfectly portioned for sharing, during our feast. First up was the Cured Strawberry and Fennel Flatbread ($14), with pickeled fennel (a favorite ingredient of Chef Jones - read my Phoenix People interview with him here), pistachio, wild baby arugula and ricotta cheese. I've never had strawberries on a pizza, but let me tell you, the flatbread was delicious and tasted just like what you'd think of when it comes to spring.\n\nWe also dug into the Avocado salad ($9), with blood oranges, grapefruit and wild greens. Elle described it perfectly as \""chic diet food,'\"" a light and fresh salad you could feel good eating right before a night out or before getting into a swimsuit, since it was healthy and light. I loved the fruit and avocado combination and gobbled up every bite.\n\nElle loved the Tater Tots she ordered (a small portion at $7), which had bacon and chive made right in the tots. \""These are every college kid's wet dream,\"" she said, noting the bacon baked in was a spectacular touch.\n\nWe both enjoyed the Corn Bread Panzanella ($9), a bread salad with artichoke, fava beans, baby leeks, and peas mixed with an herb vinaigrette. It was really filing and would be a great appetizer to share.\n\nSurprisingly, maybe our favorite savory dish was the Roasted Cauliflower ($9), really simple but oh-so-good because, like most of Blue Hound's offerings, it combined sweet, savory and salty to satisfy all your palate's tastes. It came with pistachios, capers and currants, and Justis said it's simply cooked by poaching the cruciferous vegetable in milk before charring it a little in a skillet, then adding in the capers, currants and a touch of butter and herbs.\n\nElle summed up the meal perfectly: \""I would never have thought of putting this stuff together, but it's exactly what I want,\"" she said.\n\nI was full, but we asked Justis to surprise us with dessert. He brought out the latest dessert menu item, the BHPB&J ($9), a twist on PB&J with whoopie pie, blackberry jelly ice cream, peanut butter mousse (OMG, so good), and fresh berries. The chocolate covering the whooiee pie was so decadent, and I loved all the flavors on the updated classic. \""It tastes like the Fourth of July,\"" Elle added, saying it reminded her of all-American flavors from the summer holiday.\n\nWe were stuffed, but then were surprised with dessert number two: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake served skillet-style ($9), wish medjool date ice cream atop salted caramel.\n\nWe devoured every bite despite our full bellies, and every serving was a winner for these two ladies.\n\nWhile most of what we ordered was vegetarian, Blue Hound's latest menu has some notable seafood items, including Crispy Salt N' Pepper Shrimp, Grilled Yellowfin Tuna and Red Snapper."	4
I have eaten here 5x now with in a 2 month period.  The Bleu Cheese burger and their Ranch Burger are the ABSOLUTE BEST burgers I have ever had in my life!!! ... I was recommended the Salmon Salad if I wanted a hearty but light salad, all I can say is AMAAAZZZINGGGG!!! WOW...and the staFF is wonderful, very gracious and attentive...excellent service and above all a great experience all around...	4
The steaks are so succulent, licks lips. Took my love her for his birthday dinner, well worth every dollar.	4
Water wings is great place to get your kids ready for the pools in town.   They are all very friendly and with as many kids that go there they always seem to remember each one individually which is always a welcome thing at any business. \n\nThe instructors are really great with the kids, especially the younger ones. With crying babies and children afraid of the water, the teachers all seem to have a great calm and patience about them and work through the tantrums until the child is having a blast in the pool. \n\nThey have showers to rinse off afterward and a play room for the siblings who might not be taking swim classes too. \n\nThey do parties and I'm pretty sure they have some kind of daycamp thing although my daughter is too young for that. \n\nWe love it there!	4
The food was great and they provided me excellent service. A side note is that i had the mionas special chicken and general yan chicken. Super tasty and price is right for the lunch combo.	4
One of my all time favorite places.  The Lasagana is awesome!	4
Love this place. Absolute gem of a spot. Intimate with a very chill vibe. So glad I was able to find it. It did take a while for me to pull my crap together to figure out how to make a reservation but once I did it was easy peasy. \nThe mixologist is great. I love that they come out, introduce themselves and mix a drink based on your desire, even when what you want is not on their menu. It was a great experience that I will definitely have again in the near future.	4
Very similar to the Beverly Hills one. Except in Vegas, they have a crazy ribeye and the interior is more modern and newly built with less personality. I prefer the old school charm of the Beverly Hills location. \nDelicious warm sourdough bread, refreshing spinning salad with Lawry's seasoned pepper and cold forks, huge baked potatoes with the works, juicy prime-rib with a lot of horseradish, a double order of creamed corn and spinach on the side, and fluffy Yorkshire pudding to soak up the bloody au jus!\nOne of the best meals on the planet!!	4

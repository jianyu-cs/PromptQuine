"Never again.  The rooms are not that nice and the charges are outrageous.  We checked in for a three night stay which I got at a great deal since we stayed last year (which was just bad as well, but I thought I would give them a second chance and take advantage of saving some money), but then they wanted to add an additional 50.00 (150.00!!)  per night as security ON TOP OF the 20.00 per day \""resort fee\""!!?!?  I don't think so!! I think they got the clue when I told them I would not be paying that and we were more than prepared to take our business elsewhere.  All of a sudden they were \""nice enough\"" to \""waive\"" that made up fee.  NEVER AGAiN!!! DON'T DO IT!!!!  If you don't have the money to visit Vegas properly, save a little longer! This place is a discgrace to Vegas!!"	0
Went on a Friday night a little after 7pm and there were 3 tables occupied. Went with 3 other couples. We quickly got our first round of drinks and ordered our food. Then it all went downhill. We waited over an HOUR for our good. When we finally received our food, it would come out 1 or 2 meals at a time, with at least a 10 minute lapse in between the next meal delivery. Drink refills were also ridiculously slow. The food was good, but I think that's because we were starving by the time we received it. We were dining with friends, not eating in shifts. No apologies, nothing from the 3 waitresses on duty. Mind you, there were only 4 tables occupied at any given time on FRI night! Ridiculous. Icing on the cake was the bill had not been separated like asked and gratuity was built in. Will NEVER return.	0
Amazon needs to forget about using them! My shipment never was received- they try to deliver at 8 PM- after my gate is closed- but we have a CALL BOX and they must not know how to use a phone because no one bothers.  So instead of my Amazon Prime order being received 5 days ago as expected, they sent it back today. This company is a joke, and I may be cancelling Amazon Prime and not using amazon if this continues. \n\nAVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS	0
I was in Vegas on 7/17/10.  I reserved a night through Expedia (Expedia was great), but the hotel was horrible!\n\nWhen we received the room, it was EXTEMELY hot inside, the air had not been on and it was about 110 degrees outside.  I had to use my sholder to open the door, the air was not working properly; I called for a different room and they said to wait while it cools.  Believe me, it was not cooling.  Then decided to take a cold shower to keep cool... now the toilet wasn't working!  I went to the front desk (still HOT) to at least ask for a part of my money back (had only been there about an hour.  The lady said, they had no more rooms and she couldn't do anything about it.  I would have to wait for maintenance. \n\nExpedia gave me a coupon to partially compensate.  The hotel finally found another room, which was ALOT better, in comparison to what we had\n\nI'm not one to complain, but after this experience I have more than reason to.  WILL NEVER GO BACK! please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions.	0
The soup was amazing, but that's about it. Noddles were super under cooked and seemed rushed. Tried to order in Japanese and got attitude for it, my bad every other Japanese place can either speak it or say I don't know how to speak Japanese without attitude. We were no even done eating and the server came twice asking if we were done as we are still eating. She mind as well kicked us out and ask for a tip. Still tipped her good for her garbage service.	0
I had a yellow cab driver almost run me over at the airport this morning. Not only do 1/2 scam you, they are also some of the rudest cabbies in town. It's no wonder companies like Uber are taking over their business.	0
Such a shame!!!  We have been dining at Abuelos for over 3 years now and the service and food has always been incredible.  My wife and I frequented Abuelos a few years ago for the great happy hour and incredible service by one of the bartenders i believe his name was john.  We would walk in and instantly he would have our drinks and greet us with a smile and small talk.  Unfortunately he's been gone for some time now and since leaving, the bar service is less than average.  We are very low maintenance and simple to please but for some reason it feels like we're a burden on the staff now.  Occasionally we will ask where John went and the guy that worked with him for years will shrug and say he doesn't know but his reaction is always strange.  We used to love Abuelos but now we are simply displeased with the service and the lack of friendly comfort we used to feel.  They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!	0
Clueless and slow	0
This place sucks! Just try to buy your tickets an hour before the movie shows. Because there is always a long line, and when you buy your ticket all the seats in the theatre is all taken up, and your left with the first two row seats. Sometimes the light aren't in in the theatre too so you can see the open seats when the movie hasn't even started. One of the cashiers pressured me to buy other junk food when all I sad was a small popcorn will be all. Oh yeah! The managers don't give a rats Azz if people talk in the theatre too.	1
The location was great, right on the strip. The ambience was nice too. The food, though, was a little disappointing. We opted for the rodizio and they served things like turkey and pineapple. Not an authentic brazilian churrascaria. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't authentic and unique as I had expected. Also, It was a bit pricey, I guess because of the location.	1
"Perhaps because this is close to ASU they think no one will notice the quality of sushi. Because students run in and out or do take out perhaps no one bothers to say anything. But the reality is for people that enjoy good fish, soft rice and dont mind spending the extra few $$ for quality this is not the place for you. I always think of this place as \""fast food sushi\""..It comes out fast but I ALWAYS feel something is either missing or wrong. If I am in the area and with friends and they want a low cost sushi experience I will go but then I do simple rolls that are harder to screw up. Not the worst, not the best..but maybe just right for the students that visit the most.\n\nps. I dont live close so I dont go for happy hour. This review is based on non happy hour service. From reviews it is clear they put a lot of effort into alcohol and happy hour. Perhaps after 2-3 drinks the fish tastes better or the price makes it worth while to come back."	1
The main benefit of this Goodwill is that it's large. That's a good thing, because at least 50% of what it contains is utter crap. \n\nReally, they will put just about anything on the shelf. I've seen spaghetti sauce jars, canisters with no lids, broken electronics, you name it. Or sometimes items are priced for more than what they would cost new. $1.00 for a mason jar? Really?\n\nThough, this is where I scored a Loverboy album, and a sweet American flag patterned vest for my Tea Party protestor costume.\n\nAlso, it's between Dollar Tree and Tuesday Morning. So you can get all your cheapo shopping done at once.	1
Server was very good, the coffee was delicious.  The food was terrible.  My pancake was god-awful.  The good news was that the staff noticed I wasn't eating it and took it off my bill without me asking, which was nice.  I don't know I'd go back...the creepy guy camped out at the entrance was not necessarily their fault but the food was, and so I'd probably hunt for something else next time I am in town.	1
The restaurant is pretty comfortable.  The chairs and booths are really comfortable and a great spot for large groups.\n\nThe service can use a real improvement.  6 of us met there for dinner not knowing that there was a Coyotes game going on.  The bar was really busy but the dining area was, at best, half full.  Our food took forever and my glass of water was empty most of the meal.  I had ordered wine and asked for it to come with my meal but he gave it to me with the waters along w/ everyone else.  \n\nthe food was alright.  pretty basic.  the meal could have been at Chili's, Applebees or any other assorted chain.\n\nI would like to check their happy hour out one day, I sense it's a good deal.	1
This place was a bit of a disappointment. The photos on the menu look nothing like the meals that come out of the kitchen. My son ordered the seafood mix, which had little sea food and lots of water and veggies without taste. He said it was awful. I had the Hawaiian chicken bowl and instead of nice looking chicken strips in a large bowl with rice and veggies, I got a small bowl with small bites of chicken soaked in teriyaki sauce and wilted cabbage piece. Not very good. \n\nSo do not come here because the food is not represented well by the menu.	1
DID YOU KNOW ALL THE CHEESECAKE FACTORIES ARE THE SAME?  \n\nI have been to a few of them, and this one was like the others.  If you like one where ever you are, then you'll like this one.  \n\nSERVICE:  \nThe wait is long if you go around dinner time.  We waited, gambled, and drank to get a buzz and went later than 9:00 p.m.   So, we got seated fairly quickly.  The service...nothing special...it's what you'd expect at any Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  \n\nFOOD QUALITY:  \nThe food was okay.  It was, as I said earlier, like any other Cheesecake Factory on the planet.  \n\nWOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?: \nProbably not.	1
I overheard that this was the second largest F21 location in the world. I'm not surprised, because this mall is also HUGE!\n\nWith that said, this place is just too big. Where do you start and on which floor?\n\nGirls will love this place for their variety and relatively affordable prices.	2
The hot dogs there are good, not the greatest, but I like the different toppings and types of hot dogs they have. This wouldn't be a place I have to go to every time I'm in Vegas, but would definitely go if I wanted something quick and easy. The service was nice, quick, and friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, it was really windy the day we went so we had to stand inside at a very small counter. It's pretty small inside. I wish there were more inside seating. There is plenty of outside patio seating if the weather was nice enough.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Vegas Strip Dog\n-The Showgirl Dog\n-Mushroom Swiss Dog	2
Man, I swear this place has gone in the dumps. They used to offer supurb breakfast there. It has been my staple for my annual work trips to Vegas. I told everyone they had the best pancakes you'll find. Ordered them this time and they were like cement. Went back the next day and had the Benedict. Everything tasted canned. A step down, and a generous three stars. Literally no different than your local Denny's...	2
"For some reason, Talking Stick has been sending me \""free night\"" stays for the whole summer, so we have been able to enjoy regular staycations for the past 4 months. This past weekend I decided to finally give the spa a shot, taking advantage of their \""Luxury for Locals\"" deal that they have going on for the summer (through Sept 30). I get massages regularly and have always been hesitant to go to hotel spas for the services as I have not had great experiences in the past. They seem to be overpriced and never as good as I want. But, with the free room and summer deal, I figured why not! I chose to get their Simply Essential Massage and add on the Summer Shine Body Polish.\n\nThe reception area didn't impress me too much. I like to have a calming atmosphere right when I go into a spa, but I was greeted with rock music and tacky products placed all over for sale. The shirts they were selling have that cheesy \""bachelorette party\"" feel and I wasn't a fan of being overwhelmed with cheap jewelry and products right when walking in. The staff is friendly and quick to take you on the tour of the area, so that was a positive.   \n\nI have always loved the clean, modern, and calm feel of the rooms at the Talking Stick. The spa decor is exactly the same - lots of rich, dark browns contrasted with lighter hues to provide a calming environment. The spa has all the typical amenities you would expect for a resort spa: changing room, lockers, fluffy robes & slippers, dressing area, jacuzzi, steam room, and relaxation area. All areas were clean and decorated nicely. I didn't come early enough to do a ton of relaxing beforehand, but got to explore the area enough.\n\nI got my massage from Bernadette, and was very pleased with the quality of the session. I was worried that since it was a traditional Swedish massage that she wouldn't get into my muscles as much as I wanted, but she did a really nice job of combining relaxation and some muscle work. The sheets on the table were AMAZING...I honestly felt like I was floating because of how soft and silky they were.  The body polish was an interesting experience. It's basically a full body exfoliation using a sugar scrub, followed by rinsing off in the shower, then full body application of a body butter. It felt good, but I would probably opt for a facial or pedicure in lieu of it next time. The biggest negative during the treatment was again, the MUSIC! I hated the music they played. It was weird and not relaxing at all...kind of like a combination of elevator music and new age trance or something. The only other minor issue is that the massage was scheduled for 60 minutes and the body polish was supposed to be a 45 minute treatment, but in total I was only in there for 90 minutes, so I'm not sure what happened to the extra 15 minutes.\n\nAll in all it was a good experience. I would come back for their specials, and would rank this on the higher end of resort spas."	2
This is a good place here in Vegas.  They menu is limited, but the food is very good.  They just started a Sunday Brunch which we happened to catch and they have some kinks to work out in getting organized for this, so for this review, I will say it was average.  \n\nI ordered eggs over medium and they were well done, the steak was overcooked as well.  The hash browns, looked like mine I make at home (this is NOT a compliment).  For the food they serve and what we have had in the past at this place, I expected a LOT better then what we received.\n\nNormally I would give this place 5 stars, but on this visit, 3 is pushing it.  Now, if they can get a better system in place for the Sunday Brunch and a better cook who does not over cook the food, then they will have a winning combination on Sunday's.\n\nI will give this place some time and try the Sunday Brunch again as like I said before, we have been to this place a few times since reopening and we do like the food and the experiences we had in the past and I believe this does deserve another chance.  \n\nOh yes, if you like mimosa's and bloody mary's, during Sunday Brunch it is all you can drink for $10.00, so that alone should be an incentive to get you in if you like those drinks.  We would return and this is a place we would recommend so you can be the judge and jury to base your experience on return or not. For now, Sunday Brunch, one more chance will be given.	2
Brand new 101 here hit the ground running this morning at 10 AM.  It's a big, pretty place featuring sushi made while you watch, & I counted up 88 food items, plus sauces & dressings.\n\nAfter landing in a comfortable booth, I started with their Hot & Sour Soup, which was delicious, & had meat in it... something I always appreciate.  There were most of the regular items that we have come to expect at a good-sized Chinese Buffet, & here are a few more tastes that stood out for me:\n\n*  Excellent Salad Bar, with SIX dressing choices!\n\n*  Delicious, bone-in BBQ Pork Spare Ribs!\n\n*  Big, tasty breaded, fried shrimp!\n\n*  Scallops on the half-shell, with a shrimp thrown in too, just for fun!\n\n*  Oysters on the half-shell!\n\n*  Your choice of several flavors of REAL ice cream!\n\nSo here's an fun new Chinese Buffet in North Phoenix.  3 1/2-Stars!	2
First visit to Xinh Xinh today for lunch.  I ordered the rice vermicelli with chicken and peanut and a spring roll. Food was delicious but the service left something to be desired.  We had to wait quite awhile for someone to take our order, and no one ever came to ask how everything was or to refill our drinks.  I wish I had ordered an appetizer or side dish because, while what I had was delicious, it was not quite filling.  I will be back again when I am in the mood for good Vietnamese food.	2
Spinning and eating are not normally things I do together... Nor do I ever want to do it again. The only time I spin is after a heavy night of drinking ... And we all know how fun that is.\n\nSo the shtick of this place is this: it's a restaurant on a relatively tall building in downtown Phoenix that spins, thus giving you a 360 degree view of the area around the hotel. \n\nBut it spins just a tad too fast. You can hear and feel the gears of the place going, oftentimes creaking in certain areas. The central wall is painted one boring color of baby-crap brown and there's nothing on it but a hand rail (really?!) that looks like a relic from the 70s.\n\nAnd it was freezing! Uncomfortable so. \n\nThe food was good. I had the salmon entree and it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked and a large portion. The appetizer was a pain in the ass. It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty, but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings, but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small. And there ain't no way I'm dropping oily mushrooms on this dress I'm wearing. I gave it up after the first slice. \n\nOverall, a weird experience. The place was practically empty on a Friday night and because the room is curved you can hear mystery voices of people you can't see... Can they hear me?!\n\nEven though I liked the dinner... I won't be back. Spinning around twice was enough for me.\n\nFYI- one rotation is almost exactly an hour long. And Arizona is damn boring more than once.	2
Super fast and super friendly!  Whenever I'm craving some good take-out Chinese food, this is the place to go.  They have great prices and you get a decent amount of food for the money.  The owners are very personable, he even brought each of my kids a toy when delivering to my house once.  We've tried other Chinese food places in the Surprise area, and have found Chen & Wok to be one of the best.	3
When craving any type of mexican seafood, this is the place to go. Their 'botana negra' is delicious!! Also, their preparadas are bomb!	3
Spinach Tortellini with alfredo sauce was quite delicious, as well as the Four Cheese Pizza.  Cheese on this pizza was quite thick, almost a chore to cut and serve with the spatula.  Crust is golden, chewy overall, and rather medium in thickness.\n\nClean & new place with newer furniture, and plenty of round tables.  Server was prompt and polite, and was helpful with menu selections.  Prices were fair.\n\nI wish the tables were bigger.  The little round ones are simply inadequate for 4 people, and really the pizza should be served on one of those elevated pizza holders.  There's just no room.  Draft selection was poor as well with Anheuser-Busch/InBev products only.\n\nNice quiet lunch spot on weekdays.	3
For a bagel shop in the desert, it doesn't get much better.  Great selection of fresh bagels (I love the Salt w/ lox).  \n\nThe service is quick and friendly, and the decor has local flavor you wont find at any big chain.  The owners really turned this place around about 4 years ago.  Now it is a thriving local hangout for the active adult in Ahwatukee.  In fact, they attract so many road bikers, a bike shop opened next door last year.	3
zowie bowie really knows how to get the crowd goin and they sound awesome!!!\n\nprops to 'em!	3
Really, really, neat! We brought our 9 year old son and he enjoyed it, too. It was awesome how you can see everything and nothing is hidden behind glass. Literally, you could touch the bodies! (But don't... Lol). Only reason why I didn't give it five stars was due to price. We are locals and I had a coupon and I still paid almost $90 for the 3 of us. They should really let children be admitted for free because although it is interesting, they don't really find much enjoyment from it like adults do. The whole exhibit takes about an hour and when we went it was uncrowded. Fantastic exhibit overall and I am glad I got to experience it!	3
Beautiful salon with a wonderful owner who made planning a fun Bachelorette celebration really easy and enjoyable. For a reasonable cost per person, we were able to close the salon to just our private party of seven where three stylists got to work while we had champagne and crudite all ready and set up for us to enjoy. (They even decorated with some special Bachelorette signs and balloons).\nThe bride-to-be loved it all and while the degree of everyone's satisfaction with the actual blowouts/styles were all over the spectrum, the overall experience was really nice.	3
I forgot to ask who Kiyoshi was!  All I know is that it is a common Japanese boy's name.  Tonkatsu on the other hand (which I often confuse with Tonkotsu) is deep fried panko-breaded pork cutlet.  Just like breaded pork chop, Japanese style. When you enter the place, it looks very Japanese with the set-up and d\u00e9cor, but there was summer-y Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is tiny and I'm glad we went at an odd hour.\n\nIf we came more hungry, I would've wanted to try their beef tataki and daily special off menu agedashi tofu.  But today, we went straight to the entrees.  We had... \n\n1. The miso soup which came with both our orders.  This was awesome, definitely a notch above your standard bowls in Jap restaurants.  \n\n2. The Katsu Curry which has 2 pork cutlets, lots of rice, lots of curry with chunks of potato and carrot.  Their katsu preparation is good - thick cuts that maintain their juiciness with breading that is light and not greasy.  Their curry sauce has much stronger flavors than your typical Japanese curry, in fact, it really reminded me of the Indian version.  Hubby enjoyed it.\n\n3. The Katsudon (Katsu donburi) has katsu over rice topped with egg and katsudon sauce (which is a savory-sweet sauce).  There were a couple of grilled shishito peppers on the side as well.  The katsu itself is not salty and is meant to be dipped in curry or tonkatsu sauce so I wish this thin type sauce was tastier.  It was, however, still very good. \n\n4. Chicken Karaage for the lil man.  This was a very different preparation from the karaages in ramen joints.  The batter is not as light and the piece of chicken is denser.  Although good, I prefer the ramen joint version a lot better. \n\n5. Japanese potato salad.  This is a sweeter version of a classic with eggs and cucumbers.  A refreshing side to cut the fried goodness.\n\n6. Melon soda.  It comes in a bottle and I didn't care for this too much because it has a Yakult after taste.  But hubby loved it so much he asked for one to go.  Try it if you haven't had any melon soda yet.\n\n7. Their tonkatsu dipping sauce.  I love places that serve condiments.  I really do.  Each table comes with sauce and roasted sesame seeds which you grind yourself with a wooden pestle.  The tonkatsu sauce tastes like the Bulldog bottles you buy in Jap grocery stores.  If you haven't had this condiment, you might really love it or find it weird because it is slightly sour.  Kinda like catsup meets soy sauce meets sugar meets Worcestershire sauce.  I like it though.  And normally, I don't care much for sesame seeds but man!  The roasted sesame flakes on this tonkatsu sauce really elevates it to another level.  Real good stuff.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal a lot, and service rocked.  However, for the 2 entrees, 2 sides and 4 drinks, our bill was already over $50 with tip.  It's not cheap, and I wish it was so I can keep coming back.  But if you are a fan of fried Japanese goodness, then you might end up being a Kiyoshi groupie.	3
"I have been a customer for 4 months. I shopped around and after lots of calls and conversations, hired Dori's.  Christian and Amber own the company and do all the work.  They saved me from a HUGE algae stain in a brand new 20,000 gallon in-ground pool! Stupidly I thought I could take care of it-NOT!!! They came and in two weeks got the problem solved! Saved my butt!  They are extremely knowledgable both about water chemistry and pump/filter systems. They can fix anything and solve any problem.  They are honest, and care about their work.  They are very nice and will respond immediately to any \""pool crisis\""!  All of this for the most reasonable price around. They come every week and my pool is beautiful! By the way, Christian is a former US Marine and has served in the Gulf War. He is an American Hero! Needless to say, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dori's Pool Service!."	4
This place is off the chain! Food, service, atmosphere and speed of service are all top-notch. Kathy (our server) and Shawn (our greeter) showed great personalities and kept us smiling... in fact, everyone in the place was smiling. I'm adding Mr. Mama's to my list of regular Vegas stops!	4
Living down in Sierra vista 2 years killed me knowing that there is a few yard houses couple hundred miles north. \n\nThey have the BOMBEST onion rings than any other place I've been to! I think there batter is laced with crack. I can eat a entire tower by myself there that good. Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it.\n\nFood there is on the high side but it's worth it. Havnt ordered anything that didn't taste like it came out of a freezer bag. You wont be disappointed. \n\nEvery time I come here I always start with there sampler pack which consists of 6 beers they choose for the month. Your bound to find something that you will like. \n\nSeriously don't come here and order a bud light or a corona. I mean really im sure there are people that just won't try anything new but really though... There will be something you will love just as much if not even better than your pre existing favorite. \n\nThere is usually a tall guy with a beard working the bar every time I come here. He has been here since it opened ad he will find something to quench your thirst :)\n\nIf your like me and have a few to many of those half yards and feel like you may have had a few to much. Dont be a dummy and drive off so the scottsdale PD can give you a DUI. Big no no! then just go walk it off in the fashion square mall.	4
I've been coming here for almost 4 years. The customer service has always been on point! I really like the simplicity, the atmosphere, and how quickly everything happens. An easy five stars from me.	4
I knew this place would be good, because I have been to Akira Back's restaurant Yellowtail before.  I wasn't disappointed.  The Crispy Rice appetizer with the Blackened Tuna was really good.  I also had the Pop Rockin Roll and Blue Fin.  The Sushi was really good.  But the thing that was over the top fantastic was the Toban Filet.  It is served in a hot bowl with Mushrooms and Broth.  It is to die for good!  It was on the rare side and just melted in your mouth.  I would go back just for that.  The dessert was really good as well.  A little spendy, but I don't mind if the food is good and it was!  The service and decor are also great.  We will definitely be going back to Kumi!!	4
I have died and gone to shawarma heaven! The chicken shawarma plate is probably in my top 3 all time favorite meals. The chicken is bursting with flavor, the hummus is amazingly creamy, the rice is perfect...I could go on and on! \n\nThe owner of Shawarma King is very nice, as well. Prices are great for the sheer amount of quality, delicious food you get.\n\nIf you are in the 43rd and Cactus area, you NEED to stop by. \n\nI would give 10 stars if possible!	4
Friendly service and the coffee is always great! There drive-thru line gets pretty long but so does every other Starbucks I have been too. Great location right next to the freeway.	4
"Their food is great! The ambiance is superbly friendly and the weekly Wednesday night \""MPG Jazz Jam\"" is 21st century's doorway to Jazz heaven!! sincerely Dr Bruce from PittsburghJAM.org"	4

nothing that special about this place.
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers!
worst customer service i have ever had.
no, not the ones at asu, the ones in junior high.
she doesn't say anything and just walks away.
ate kicked ass, marquee, not so much.
the restroom was a mess.
i do not like to be screwed over, or short changed.
he didn't even offer another time for me to come in.
it was my last weekend visiting my folks.
needless to say, i contacted the store manager directly after leaving.
is that a good thing or a bad thing?
it's just too expensive for what you get.
i'm still craving my drunken noodles!
didn't even get a response.
the woman who works in the deli is horrible.
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online.
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret.
one was for my dog, and one was for my wife's dog.
it didn't matter of she is good at all other times.
had it not been so terribly hot, it would have just been inconvenient.
this place is beyond a shit hole.
service was just as disappointing.
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor.
the beer isn't bad, but the food was less than desirable.
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter's college graduation.
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill.
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care.
the food is not that authentic.
liar, liar, pants on fire.
my services were very rushed and she didn't even do a good job.
i just walked out, called the manager to complain.
let me tell you, this place was far from busy!
you can not judge people based on appearance.
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself!
when i arrived, no one was at the desk.
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible.
university is also almost as bad as living on apache.
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert.
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs.
she was getting pissed, and so were we.
and management doesn't do anything about it.
very crowded, difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time.
we didn't leave with anything that day.
pathetic place, worst food.
however, this experience went pretty smooth.
um, yah, it doesn't need replacing just yet.
it was embarrassing for all involved, though i don't think he noticed.
half of my head was over processed.
the staff was nowhere to be found.
not so much these days.
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers.
sounds good doesn't it?
we stood there in shock, because we never expected this.
he did not return my call either.
were we irritating her or something?
tonight i lost all respect for this company.
however, it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would.
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee.
didn't seem to care about their job.
it's not my fave, but it's not awful.
needless to say, i will not be returning to this place ever again.
did they not have a fountain machine on site?
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them.
do not sign a lease with these people.
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely.
second time, not so good.
avoid if at all possible.
oh well, who cares... right?
the pizza is offered without toppings and it's lacking in flavor.
you can not pay me to ever shop here!
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks....
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it.
i dont know why i was expecting anything different.
the door wouldn't open at all.
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery!
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks!
the problem is nothing was good.
went back in for adjustment, realized still incorrect.
when it came we should have sent it back.
these days the quality is pretty lousy.
unfortunately, it is the worst.
always takes way too long even if you're the only one there.
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant.
i guess even great restaurants have bad days.
i didn't know ra was a chain.
yes, the portions were large, but size isn't everything.
my jack and coke was seriously lacking.
i checked online, and the coupon site said my certificate was good.
when i picked up the order, i was given another totally different price.
i would never reccomend anyone to live here.
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff.
this place is a shit hole with shit service.
had to returned one entree because too cold.
it's not much like an actual irish pub, which is depressing.
its also not a very clean park.
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow.
in the long run, they did absolutely nothing for me.
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off.
if i wasn't with my coworker, i would've walked out.
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining.
the falafel's looked like chicken nuggets, and were lacking flavor.
also, could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers?
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option.
and the pizza was cold, greasy, and generally quite awful.
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef!
would have rated lower if i could.
even the ice cream was very, very run of the mill.
i was not impressed, and would not recommend this place.
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency.
they're nowhere near any fight that breaks out.
actually, just keep walking.
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly.
the others ordered the short rib hash, also over-cooked and dry.
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food.
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years.
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting.
so i ordered my tires online, scheduled an appointment for two days out.
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy.
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality.
i didn't even eat it.
however, the manager came back & told me my order was coming up.
other than that, i really don't know what was good about it.
we'll see if that happens, but i'm not holding my breath.
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer.
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before.
it was over fried and very hard.
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that.
they do not stock some of the most common parts.
so, that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there.
maria the manager is a horrible person.
so, it went in the trash.
horrible job on nails and toes.
and for this reason, i won't return.
what the hell are you doing?
not sure and i don't care!
the food isn't too bad but the service is terrible.
the overall prices are not competitive with frys.
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off.
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings.
we told them to forget it, we didn't want to wait.
but their inventory was questionable!
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me!
their cheese i'm certain was of the string variety.
maybe they were having a bad night?
the server wasn't buying.
service fair, pace was bad between courses - long waits.
the game room is a waste of time, energy and money.
even the water tasted horrible.
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel.
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud.
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order.
is zero stars an option?
management no longer cares about the golf experience.
seriously though, i have never shopped here.
anything they say, ask in writing.
i will never purchase another lv bag again.
the equipment is so old and looks dirty.
had to wait a month to get in.
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage.
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture.
but the customer service ruins it all for me.
parking : no signs or anything, so you just have to guess.
i'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day.
but it was disgusting and hot in there.
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place.
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average.
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy.
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit.
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left.
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal.
when it finally came out, it was bad.
i tried to no avail.
unfortunately, the tour guides are not experts.
firstly, their fees are generally higher than other places.
i was very disappointed with this place.
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations.
but let this story begin at noon today.
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude.
save your money & your patience.
he couldn't actually read her pressure, though.
french toast plate was good, mom said, but eggs were cold.
first, the bartender was an a -- hole.
it looks old and outdated.
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place.
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken.
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly.
like it's been in a fridge for a week.
i went to sit down and wait for my order.
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day.
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy.
this place smelt like old urine for some reason.
there was no personality to our server.
this is a terrible college.
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve!
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop.
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place.
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza.
it is the absolute worse place in the valley.
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink.

{"prompt": "Question: Ivan has a bird feeder in his yard that holds two cups of birdseed. Every week, he has to refill the emptied feeder. Each cup of birdseed can feed fourteen birds, but Ivan is constantly chasing away a hungry squirrel that steals half a cup of birdseed from the feeder every week. How many birds does Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feed weekly?\nLet's think step by step\nThe squirrel steals 1/2 cup of birdseed every week, so the birds eat 2 - 1/2 = 1 1/2 cups of birdseed.\nEach cup feeds 14 birds, so Ivan\u2019s bird feeder feeds 14 * 1 1/2 = 21 birds weekly.\nThe answer is 21\n\nQuestion: Samuel took 30 minutes to finish his homework while Sarah took 1.3 hours to finish it.

{"prompt": "Question: Janet hires six employees. Four of them are warehouse workers who make \\$15/hour, and the other two are managers who make \\$20/hour. Janet has to pay 10% of her workers' salaries in FICA taxes. If everyone works 25 days a month and 8 hours a day, how much does Janet owe total for their wages and taxes for one month?\nLet's think step by step\nFirst figure out how many hours each worker works per month by multiplying the number of days they work by the number of hours a day they work: 25 days * 8 hours/day = 200 hours\nThen calculate how much one warehouse worker makes per month by multiplying their hourly rate by the number of hours they work: 200 hours * \\$15/hour = \\$3000\nThen multiply that number by 4 to find out how much all the warehouse workers make: \\$3000/worker * 4 workers = \\$12,000\nNow multiply the hours each manager works (also 200) by their hourly wage to find out how much one manager makes per month: 200 hours * \\$20/hour = \\$4,000\nNow multiply one manager's wages by the number of managers (2) to find their total wage amount: \\$4,000/manager * 2 managers = \\$8,000\nNow add the wages for the managers and the workers to find the total cost of the wages: \\$8,000 + \\$12,000 = \\$20,000\nNow multiply the total wage bill by 10% to find how much the FICA taxes are: \\$20,000 * .1 = \\$2,000\nNow add the total wage bill to the total tax amount to find the grand total: \\$2,000 + \\$20,000 = \\$22,000\nThe answer is 22000\n\nQuestion: In a graveyard, there are 20 skeletons.  Half of these skeletons are adult women, and the remaining number are split evenly between adult men and children.  If an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, and a male has 5 more than this, and a child has half as many as an adult woman, how many bones are in the graveyard?\nLet's think step by step\nWe first need to figure out how many of each type of skeleton there are. Since half the 20 skeletons are adult women, that means there are 20/2=10 adult women's skeletons.\nThe remaining half, 10, is split between adult men and children, meaning there are 10/2= 5 of each.\nSince an adult woman has 20 bones in their body, this means that the 10 skeletons have 20*10=200 bones in total.\nSince an adult man has 5 more bones in their body than an adult woman, this means they have 20+5= 25 bones in their body.\nThere are 5 adult men, meaning there are 25*5=125 bones in the adult male skeletons in total.\nSince a child has half as many bones as the 20 in an adult woman, this means the children have 20/2= 10 bones in their body.\nSince there are 5 children, this means there are 5*10= 50 bones in the children's skeletons in total.\nTherefore, altogether there are 50+125+200= 375 bones in total in the graveyard.\nThe answer is 375\n\nQuestion: Last month, a factory made 12000 dolls and their associated accessories.  The accessories for each doll included 2 shoes, 3 bags, 1 set of cosmetics, and 5 hats.  If each doll took 45 seconds to make and each accessory took 10 seconds to make, what was the total combined machine operation time, in seconds, required to manufacture all of the dolls and their accessories?\nLet's think step by step\nThe number of shoes the factory made was 12000 dolls x 2 shoes/doll = 24000 shoes\nThe factory also made for each doll 12000 dolls x 3 bags/doll = 36000 bags\nThe set of cosmetics made for each doll was just one, so there are 12000 cosmetics sets\nFinally, the number of hats for the dolls was 12000 dolls x 5 hats/doll = 60000 hats\nIn total, the number of accessories was 24000 + 36000 + 12000 + 60000 = 132000 accessories\nThe dolls took in total 12000 dolls x 45 seconds/doll = 540000 seconds to be made\nAll the accessories also took 132000 accessories x 10 seconds/accessory = 1320000 seconds\nCombing both results, we have that the total time the machinery was working was 1320000 + 540000 = 1860000 seconds\nThe answer is 1860000\n\nQuestion: Tina makes \\$18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nLet's think step by step\nShe works 8 hours a day for \\$18 per hour so she makes 8*18 = \\$144.00 per 8-hour shift\nShe works 10 hours a day and anything over 8 hours is eligible for overtime, so she gets 10-8 = 2 hours of overtime\nOvertime is calculated as time and a half so and she makes \\$18/hour so her overtime pay is 18*.5 = \\$9.00\nHer overtime pay is 18+9 = \\$27.00\nHer base pay is \\$144.00 per 8-hour shift and she works 5 days and makes 5 * \\$144 = \\$720.00\nHer overtime pay is \\$27.00 per hour and she works 2 hours of overtime per day and makes 27*2 = \\$54.00 in overtime pay\n2 hours of overtime pay for 5 days means she makes 54*5 = \\$270.00\nIn 5 days her base pay is \\$720.00 and she makes \\$270.00 in overtime pay so she makes \\$720 + \\$270 = \\$990.00\nThe answer is 990\n\nQuestion: {sentence_1}\nLet's think step by step", "index": 2}

The produce was local, the location had a great vibe, in a nightclub, but here's the hook. A wall of garage doors added an open air feel, but you were still in the shade...a welcome thing in July and August. People clearly came from all over the valley, and I had the pleasure of seeing at least a dozen friends and neighbors, adding an additional, genuine, home grown social experience as well...something that seems to be lacking in Vegas sometimes. It was kind of cool seeing people from the farmers market drift around the corner to the local coffee shop (The Beat) for some eats and beverages, all adding to that sense of community that is taking root downtown. Some of the growers on site, included: Herbs by Diane* Gilcrease Orchard* UNCE Orchard* McLeod Ranch* Blue Lizard Farm* Colorado River Coffee Roasters* L.A. Specialty* Bloomin' Desert Herbs* Lincoln Co. NV Producers Co-Op* Sweet Tomato Test Garden* Valley Farms and *Crossfire Ranch Produce. More growers are slated to participate. A big thanks to market founder Gina Gavan, I'd love to meet her to thank her personally. You can park right in front of the building, but bring plenty of quarters, as it is metered parking, and those meter cops love cultivating new business in the form of tickets. Avoid the risk, and simply park for free at El Cortez, no validation needed either-Bonus! All things considered, for Vegas, this is one of the better farmers markets I've been to. Just keep in mind we don't have the resources of some other cities, so don't expect a 3rd and Fairfax or a Pike Place Farmer's Market. This one is still worth a visit and tough to beat in Las Vegas.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: My husband and I stayed here while traveling to Phoenix. Buildings are nice, and parking is plentiful. It is an extended stay hotel so there are some rooms that look like apartments overflowing with personal decorations. It is very pet friendly as I saw nearly 10 people with dogs in the lawn. My bigger concern was security. The walls are paper thin, and I heard a domestic dispute in the room above me. I called the front desk at 1 am to report loud commotion and screaming. The man said he would send security, and I think he did because it stopped. I had I call again at 7 am because it started for the second time. The girl at the front desk seemed apathetic toward my call, an didn't offer security or anything. I wouldn't recommend this place for a family with young children.

The best part about ordering at the place to is that they will sing to you if you order nachos. I couldn't make out what they were saying 100% but it was entertaining.

I am really impressed by their business, last week we got two regular subs, when we got home we noticed that it seemed to be lacking in meat and the cheese was non-existent on one and paper thin on the other. The subs were still good, but it was disappointing and I sent my concern off to Jersey Mike's. Within a couple of hours the manager of the location I had this experience called me.\\n\\nShe offered to treat my family to a sub dinner for our trouble. That is obvious commitment to quality service. The subs were fantastic this time.

Yes their prices are a bit higher then a place like subway, but you do get what you pay for!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The food:\\n\\nFinally, the saving grace that could make me return to this place. Or so I had hoped. Here's what the two of us ended up ordering (text from their website):\\n\\n-Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter - 3 pieces of Chicken Southern Fried (got three thighs) w/ 2 side orders & cornbread. For the two sides, we got Cheesy Grits and Mac n Cheese.\\n== The thighs were okay, definitely juicy but lacking in flavor. the chicken tasted bland, and 1 of these thighs were so bloody at the bone the meat around it tasted like iron. The skin was nice and crisp, but all I could taste was \\u6912\\u76d0 flavor, aka salt, pepper, and either 5spice and msg or just msg. Not necessarily bad, but not what I expected from a 'southern soul food' place. The Mac n Cheese was super cheesy and not bad, but not why I chose Lolo's for lunch. Cheesy Grits got a scoop of butter on top. why? Cornbread was dry and had a decent muffintop/honeyglaze and also came with a scoop of butter on top. \\n\\n-#1 - 3pc chix southern style, 2 waffles, grits & 2 eggs with cheese & onions\\n== Sam Yu's food; I didn't taste this as it was nearly the same as my orders. Honestly we didn't share much. \\n\\n-#3 - 3px chix (thigh, leg, and wing) prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles\\n== This thigh was also bloody. Ate around it. The leg was abnormally large, looked like it was frenched rib, and was terribly dry. The wing was actually juicier than the drumstick. Strange but true. So the chicken wasn't fantastic here, but it was definitely expensive. at $2.50 per piece I would definitely not come back for their chicken. Would their waffles be able to pull a last minute win for them? Unfortunately the waffles I received were as dry as Arizona's summer desserts. I couldn't eat it alone, or with some of the butter I had transplanted from my cornbread and the scoop from my grits. I noticed at this point my cousin's waffles came with syrup. Since I was being a stubborn child I didn't request some syrup and just left their waffles to be that bad. dry, hard, and nothing special.\\n\\n-South Side Chili Cheese Fries - Hot fries topped with our homemade chili & cheese\\n== My cousin's, and after all the stuff I had tried, I didn't both trying this.\\n\\n-Grape Koolaid\\n== Wow that's sweet. I let the ice melt a good amount before drinking it in order to let the water dilute the Koolaid. Novelty mason jar, but wayyyyy sweet.\\n\\n-Lemonade\\n== My cousin also reported a great disturbance in his blood-sugar levels after drinking this.\\n\\nInstant regret. Ordered way too much food for the two of us, but for me that meant leftovers I could give to the dog or myself later. Sadly I probably won't be returning here on my own volition, unless it's to accompany somebody else / give it a measly second chance. Maybe my expectations were set too high, maybe I've been spoiled by Crispy Fried Chicken in San Diego, or maybe I'm just too damn critical about food. Regardless, I do not recommend spending your money or time at Lolo's. Making your own is much cheaper and will taste so much better.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Came here during CES with few friends, the reservation was made for indoors, and when we arrived they asked us to sit outside (freezing).

But I am so happy we decided to stay for lunch. I had the cuban and my girlfriend had the roast beef sandwich. Both were excellent (ask for a side of horseradish sauce for the roast beef). Coffee was great and was served in a huge mug. We has a hard time deciding on a side because they all looked so good. The sweet potato and black bean salad was excellent. I couldn't believe how reasonably priced everything was for being made in-house and organic.

Seriously, if I have to be a Navajo Code Talker to order off your damn menu, that's not cool.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:\\n\\nIn-N-Out makes for a nice change of pace.  The burgers are certainly better than say, McDonald's or Burger King.  A little more expensive than your average fast food establishment, but all the cool kids eat here.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Great Sandwiches - Just okay service.\\n\\nLet me preface this review by saying that I recently moved back to the Madison area from Chicago, where I lived within walking distance of a Potbelly and ate there way more often than I really should admit. While pregnant with my second child I probably ate there twice a week.  What can I say?  I'm a little obsessed. Their sandwiches are great. Their salads are great. Their soup is great. Their shakes - you guessed it, great. ;)  All that being said, the East Side location needs to step up their game a bit.  I've eaten there a few times and a) it took FOREVER to get my sandwich - I think I could have probably jumped behind the counter and made it faster and b)I've had a few errors with my meal...things forgotten, ingredients incorrect, etc.  So - 4 stars it is - because bad service or not, I'd still eat there twice a week if I lived closer!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Maybe I was just there on an off night, but my experience here was not great. They have the potential to be a great place, but the staff just seemed overwhelmed (or maybe just over worked. \\n\\nWe had a couple drinks at the bar, which was fine. Then we went to the theater to see out movie. Nice big comfy seats (so much potential). We put in an order for drinks and an appetizer. The service was slow, there were 2 servers, and I think they were serving multiple theaters. We got our drinks but our appetizer never came. Our appetizer was on the bill, which we had to track down the server to have it removed. At the end of the movie there were many people from our theater standing around waiting on issues to be dealt with (incorrect bills mostly). By the way the drinks and food were a bit overpriced for what you got. \\n\\nAnother server also took my parking ticket to be validated, but never returned it ($16 to park with NO ticket). We tracked him down, and he couldn't find it, but he was nice enough to go down to the parking garage and use his employee pass to let us out (shout out to Joe!).\\n\\nI would give the place a second chance, but I would not go out of my way to go there. I hope it was just an off night!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Came in with my dad during one sweltering August night, lured in by the cute 50's ambience and by the nostalgia of going to the Sugar Bowl as a kid.  The people who worked there were simply rude, barely acknowledging our presence.  When we ordered I saw that he scooped out of a container that said Dreyer's. If a sundae could be bland, this was.

Today, though, things are much different. First of all, the food has gone from decent to flippin' AWESOME! Can you say flavor? You might get bigger pieces of fish at other places, but the sushi here is excellently chilled (warm raw sushi freaks me out a little) and full of flavor. Unlike many sushi places in the Mesa area, they really have an excellent flavor to their rice, so you end up enjoying it rather than viewing it as filler to go with your fish. \\n\\nAnd that is as far as the food goes. THe service here has improved greatly, too - plus, the staff are super friendly, so if things do get a little slow, all you have to do is flag the waitress down and check on your order. That doesn't happen often, though - no more than the average business. The decor of the place has also improved - so, yeah, that might be a little silly, but the ambience of a place does make a great difference. My first time there, it was just green walls, black tables, no frills, nothing. And if you went into the bathroom, you were blinded by this hiddeous flourescent orange color that blinded you. Bathroom has been redone, they have adorable lanterns and parisols up on the walls overall, a great little place.\\n\\nMy only word of caution is that the place honestly isn't that big. They do have a large table they set up and separate from the room with a screen if you have a bigger group, but if you have more than eight people.... it might be a tad crowded. This place is slighly on the cozy side. Not bad , though.\\n\\nGo for the Chirashi bowl!! it's delicious!!

I got an acai bowl and it was delicious. However, every time I've returned it's been horrible. They always mess up my order and everyone else's that I've been with. To add to that the staff is rude and incompetent. How hard is it to add some extra bananas or blueberries to an order? The quality of their juices and acai bowls is inconsistent. I've ordered the same thing each time I've been and it always turns out differently.

I have had two different gals cut my hair and each has been more than pleasant. I pay $12 for the hair cut plus tip so it's not going to be any cheaper elsewhere.

Although each taco tasted bitter on the first bite, that quickly yielded to a pretty good Mexican treat with crunchy Iceberg Lettuce, a slice of American Cheese, an oily but crunchy taco shell, and good meat paste with enough mild Hot Sauce inside to confidently elect not to add any more.  \\n\\nI also enjoyed very good Value French Fries, while Diane savored her Bacon Cheddar Wedges.  Staffers were friendly and efficient, and the place was clean.  The total tariff was ridiculously low.  What's not to like?\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This review is a pretty long time coming. Let me say that I came here with my boyfriend in May on a recommendation from family. We were also interested in staying here because it's brand new, the City Center seemed really neat, and the Aria is a green, LEED-certified hotel. \\n\\nWe booked via Southwest Air - hotel & flight together because we found a deal for 20% off your room rate and 2 free show tickets. Nice deal.\\n\\nWe took a shuttle from the airport and were confused when we arrived at the Aria because it dropped us off in back in this underground garage area. Ok..strange. A gentleman took our bags and directed us to the lobby which seemed like forever away. The lines to check in were extremely long and very slow. There was little to no organization at all. We were tired, hungry and ready to get into our room, drop our bags off, and head to lunch. No such luck.\\n\\nWhen we finally arrived to the front of the line, the woman behind the desk was very bizzare. She did not look at us, greet us kindly nor was she informative. She reminded me of Marla Hooch from A League of Their Own! She basically just told us that there was not a non-smoking room available for us and to check back in a few hours. WHAT? To be honest, this is probably the most inconvenient thing that can happen to a traveler. \\n\\nWe considered grabbing food nearby but didn't want to leave our bags for a considerable amount of time so we sat in the lobby discussing our (nonexistant) options before getting in line again. Not only did somebody completely switch lines and cut in front of me when I got to the front of the line but the person at the desk said nothing! Wow. Way to be. I was told by a much friendlier gentleman that there were no non-smoking rooms clean or ready and that it'd be about an hour. Desperate to freshen up and get our bags into a room, we took it. He said they would put us on a list for non-smoking room (you mean the one we booked months ago???) and we'd receive a phone call. \\n\\nCrabby and starving, my boyfriend and I arrived to our temporary floor and room. IT REEKED! The attempt to cover the cigarette smoke was a joke and made the odor worse. We thought about just checking out and going back to the Bellagio, where we had stayed a year earlier and enjoyed very much. We decided to stick it out for the afternoon.\\n\\nAfter calling 3 times and being told to call back in an hour, I was getting impatient. What is the point of booking a King room on a non-smoking floor if you aren't going to get it? I called for the last time and actually chose my words carefully. I said that I was calling about my new room (instead of asking for it) and they told me they had one ready and they'd update our key cards and we could go straight to our room. Reluctant to believe this news, I left the bags in the smoking room and went to the new room to make sure the key worked. If we dragged our bags there only to be locked out, I would have been livid. \\n\\nWe noticed that in this temporary smoking room the name on the electronic hub control thing that controls the TV, lighting, blinds, etc. was NOT ours. We were in someone else's room? When we got to the new non-smoking room our name was on the controller. Who was in our room earlier? Very strange. \\n\\nThe rest of the stay went smoothly. The pool is fantastic and the food is good. I encountered a very frustrating situation when I went to the business center to check in for our flight. I was told that I could print our boarding passes for free and that was great. However, I arrived a few minutes before I could check in so I was sitting at a computer killing a few minutes before I could log in. The man working there entered the small office area that I was sitting in and rudely said, \\\"I THOUGHT you were printing your boarding passes. The internet is NOT free.\\\" \\n\\nBasically I was scolded by this man as he was very forward and rude. I apologized and clicked out of my personal email and waited a couple more minutes for the flight log in to open up. I sent my boarding passes to print and picked them up at the desk where I was greeted. The person working there was a younger gentleman and asked how everything went. I told him that aside from being scolded for opening the internet while waiting to sign in to Southwest Air, it was fine. He continued with the same bad attitude as the previous guy! I could not believe my ears. I told him very sarcastically, \\\"Thanks for the great customer service, so sorry I was online for 3 minutes checking email while waiting to check in to my flight.\\\" He continued to be sarcastic and rude back to me. I was absolutely APPALLED. \\n\\nThe very odd thing about this place is that some of the people there are very thorough, kind, and great at their jobs. Then there are a few rude, strange and unprofessional ones. It was very inconsistent and disheartening.\\n\\nWe will not be back to the Aria or the City Center for that matter. We will indeed be back to the Bellagio next time.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: In a word - Dump. \\n\\nFrom the second you walk in this place you are greeted by the nauseating oder of cigarette smoke, assuming your able to see through the smoke the next thing you will notice is this casinos horrid decor.\\n\\nThe Fort McDowell instantly makes you feel like your walked right into 1982. From the wood trim everywhere to the harsh bright colors this place is decorated with, everything about it exemplifies ugly and outdated. Just spending an hour in this place made me feel like I needed to re evaluate my life. \\n\\nThe thing that secured the 1 star they earned from me, THEY DONT HAVE WIFI. Wireless service (Att, Verizon) does not work here. Probably because it's in the middle of nowhere and the signals can't penetrate the building. It's 2014, what business doesn't have wifi? If you expect me to be in your establishment for hours, why must I be cut off from the modern world in order to do so?\\n\\nAnyway, with casinos like Talking Stick among others that offer a modern, sexy experience, I'd never come back to the Fort McDowell.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Okay, let me just start out and say that rarely do ANY of my reviews go from 1 Star to 5 Stars in the course of one visit.  However in the instance of my recent visit, this is definitely the case.  Please preface my earlier review before continuing...\\n\\nSo after enduring my last miserable experience with iPic, I was contacted by a customer service rep, then I was put in contact with a local manager named Lawrence (Larry).  Larry apologized for the instance and said he just wanted to make it right & I was very appreciative of that.  He offered to have my tickets reimbursed, for which I was also very appreciative.  He took down my information: address, phone number.  I then waited for my passes in the mail, but to no avail.  Many months pass by, still no passes. \\n\\nBecause I have recently been making a transition to the valley, I was in town last week checking up on my new home build.  I then, once again decided to readdress the issue with the hope of some final resolution.\\nI called during the day and reached a manager named Brian Vogel.  I explained my situation about my \\\"lost in translation\\\" phone call with Lawrence and my previous horrible experience with Phil & Justin then Brian said he would call me back.  5 minutes later Brian called me & apologized for Larry's mishandling of the situation & my previous experience & offered to make it right with passes.  Brian went above and beyond and provided me with his direct number in the case all was not satisfactory on my next visit.\\n\\nFast forward to later on that week.  I treated my family to the new Farrely Brothers movie, \\\"Dumb and Dumber To\\\".  There were six of us & I used the three free passes on the event.  \\n\\nMy other two family members that hadn't been back since our incident with Phil & Justin (Heckle & Jeckle) were present with me and were very happy with the renewed experience.  Our waitress Alesse was very kind and tentative with our drinks and food orders and we ended up having a fantastic time!\\n\\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to meet the fantastic Manager Brian Vogel in person that night (because the movie played later in the night), but I definitely look forward to it in the future.  I want to shake his hand & tell him thank you!!!!\\n\\nAlso, if you get a chance Yelpers, if you've also enjoyed a great experience at this theater, Brian deserves props.  Please let him know.  He's a kind, fantastic Gentleman that genuinely cares about his business and his customers & that definitely deserves a pat on the back!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This shop is absolutely adorable, inside and out.  Their clothing selection is great, with a wide variety of styles and prices.  Most things are in excellent condition- and several items are brand new with tags.  I did have the small misfortune of reaching into a pocket of a jacket to discover a used tissue (gross).  However, since the pieces are all consigned items, this is really not all that surprising to me.

The ambiance is nice, and it would be a fun place to go with a group of friends for drinks and \\\"pre-gaming it\\\" before going out.\\n\\nBut...\\n\\nMy family and I are rib lovers, and in no way shape or form did Bobby Q make the grade.  \\n\\nThe waiter touted them as smoking \\\"all of their meats\\\" for over 18 hours.  I almost fell of the booth, because you smoke meat that long either it's going to get bitter from the amount of creosote building up, or at the very least it'd be overcooked (well, perhaps except for pulled pork).  Ribs can tolerate about 5 hours.  His hyperbole was obvious.  Perhaps some people get really excited when they hear this line, because it's supposed to sound impressive.    \\n\\nI ordered the St. Louis style spares, and parents ordered the baby backs.  All of the ribs were overcooked and mushy (\\\"falling off the bone\\\").  The spares were actually better cooked than the babys, which isn't saying much.  Interestingly enough, the babys were very fatty, in fact my Dad was spitting out pieces of fat.  Spares were not as bad (go figure, given it's usually the other way around).  We are not \\\"fat shy\\\" but this was really excessive.  The rack was not trimmed properly.\\n\\nThe ribs tasted smoked, although not an overly pronounced smoke ring.  Definitely not smoked 18 hours.\\n\\nPeople freak about the Mac & Cheese here, but it's really nothing special.

To top it off, the food was terrible. The only thing edible was the garlic breadsticks. The food and service was so bad I kept waiting for a Candid Camera crew to walk out. THe poor waitress kept apologizing for the delays and food quality, though we never complained, except to ask to cancel the food that never showed up.

My martini ($12) was a glass half filled with small, green olives and just enough gin to cover them.  I had asked for a standard martini with olives. I don't know what compelled him to put so many olives.  The waiter made sure to advise me that since I asked for Tanqueray, it was more expensive.  I don't mind paying $12 for a proper martini.  I've paid as much as $16.  But give me a proper drink.  I would have loved to go back because it was a cool spot to hear music but I also like to have a cocktail or two at the bar.

Our bus person Miguel was an absolute delight! He should have been our server-he acted more as our server than the other person. My meal was overcooked and took too long to actually enjoy the meal in its entirety. The server even mentioned that they had the same problem two weeks prior and the manager should do something about the meal and take care of it. Nothing was done, nor was an apology given for improperly cooking my meal. The Piano player was good and played requests.

I read ALL the other reviews and the small complaints reviewers had, are more than made up for by the amazing service, beautiful surrounding, serene rooms and overall outstanding accommodations. I don't think I have slept that well....the linens were so soft and the bed so comfortable. I love the nightly turn down service which is an anomaly in Vegas because most hotels have SO many rooms. At the Mandarin they treat you like you matter and that having you stay at their hotel is a privilege to them rather than at most Vegas hotels where it is the reverse.  The concierge was so helpful with restaurant reservations and show tickets. My parting thoughts as there are so many things I loved about this hotel, but it was just an oasis from the strip, it was quiet and allowed you to recharge and the experience made you feel like your business was important to them. I have stayed at many luxury hotels in the world, but for some reason feeling like a VIP in Vegas where high rollers rule the strip, counts for a bit extra and here at the Mandarin they certainly deliver.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Imbibed here while in town for the NCAA men's Frozen Four.\\n\\nClose to Consol Energy Center, fans of each school were here getting lubed up prior to the games (especially given that no alcohol is sold at NCAA events).

It stands out for its creative, interesting rolls and competitive pricing - at $15 for lunch - so if you're more into modern-style sushi and/or a bargain sushi session, this is the place to go. The appetizer entrees are pretty good too. Everything else about the place is just about standard (or a bit less), but put it in perspective of the great AYCE value. \\n\\nHighlights were the unagi nigiri, and the Dragon and Volcano rolls. The rolls are creative and well-made, without excesses of sauce and seasoning; you can order half-rolls too, which let us try a lot of the menu! Definitely a good place for rolls. \\n\\nThe unagi is particularly good if you prefer the sauce a little less sweet. Besides the unagi and hamachi, the rest of the nigiri was disappointing; the fish was so-so, and the rice was cloyingly dense. I prefer nigiri over rolls so that was unfortunate; if you require a variety of good nigiri, you may be disappointed, but it's also a matter of preference here, or maybe a bad day/selection.\\n\\nThe service was a bit lackluster, though sufficient. The waitress was spotty considering we were the only party for majority of our stay, and kept making awkward placements with the dishes. The chefs were better - attentive, and skilled, though difficult to engage with any depth. As a whole, staff interactions were pretty awkward, and I'm hesitant to visit on the same shift to have to go through that again. \\n\\nI will be back, though, to give the place a second chance on the misses, and to try more of the great, unique rolls on such a good bargain.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Still serving cold burgers. \\n\\nThe chili is good though. \\n\\nThe cherry Dr Pepper hits the spot too.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The Grand Lux Cafe at Palazzo is the easiest place to grab a good, quick bite.

I got it takeout so they put balsamic on the side and I don't think I would want it on it if I was dining in - personal preference.... I can't remember how much it was, probably a tiny bit on the pricey side which is the theme of their entire menu.... \\n\\nSomething to skip: Don't bother ordering the Mozzarella Caprese.

After looking over the menu we decided to try it. We waited for an outdoor table to clear off for 25 minutes. Finally asking someone who explained she worked in the kitchen, so she didn't do that. I may not work in the restaurant industry, but I do know that businesses should work together as a team, ESPECIALLY in front of customers. \\n\\nWe finally were seated and after another 25 mins we got water in a to-go cup. I was curious as to why we didn't get glasses like other patrons, but then I realized our waitress was lazy! She figured if she brought my 2 year old's water in a plastic cup she could be lazy with me. \\n\\nFinally, we get around to ordering. After being very specific about our orders( my mom and I suffer allergies) we received our meal. Rather my 2year old and I received our meal. My moms was missing half of what she ordered. There was no regard to our allergies and our proteins were swimming(appropriate since we ordered fish) in butter and oil. When they brought my 2 year olds, they asked if she needed utensils. I said\\\"no it's ok. She'll eat like a savage\\\" they brought her a plastic fork and I had to ask for a real set up for her. \\n\\nFood was fair. Misleading at best. It took another 20 minutes to get the check and 4 times of asking for a to-go box. \\n\\nApparently yesterday their internet went down so they couldn't get the orders to the kitchen. I hate to say this because I'm fair young but try old school, you know, write it out. Have a backup an for when this kind of thing happens. \\n\\nOverall...this was a horrific lunch. The staff was rude and inattentive, especially the hostess. \\n\\nNext time I head that way, I'll be sure to find a different restaurant. And I suggest you do too!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Saturday night.\\nDate night.\\n\\n\\\"Let's try somewhere new,\\\" I suggest to my man... and alas, he agrees!\\n\\nTen minutes later, we find ourselves sitting in Little Rangoon.

We probably would've left had it not been for the \\\"People Love Us On Yelp\\\" sticker on the door and Alfred, the friendly owner who was also our waiter...\\n\\nJared not only agreed to go somewhere new but he allowed me to do the ordering.  The first dish that caught my eye was some sort of vegetarian dish that Alfred said people either love it or hate it.  He wasn't trying too hard to sell it, so we went with some more common (at least to us) choices from the menu:  spring rolls (the kind that are not fried) with chicken, a noodle dish similar to a pad seu eu, and a vegetable dish with tofu that we added okra to.  (I love okra!)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the chicken in the spring rolls was rubbery and kind of gross... and the vegetable dish was covered in a really oily sauce that lacked flavor.  I'd probably give this place two stars, but Alfred was nice enough and they serve okra - huge props for that.  Even so, the meal was pricey for what we had... and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.  I hope it was an off night for their sake.  \\n\\nAnd now, because of our so-so / not fantastic experience, I am pretty sure I will not be allowed to choose the date night restaurant for a while... :(\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I'm sad, but I really didn't like their sushi.

We were told it was not allowed to be used cause it didn't have a bar code ... Um we paid for this coupon so we should be allowed to use it!! Whatever didn't want to argue for 20 min so we played anyways. \\n\\nFirst hole was horrible it seemed like it was not working right and the guy working was watching us as we were getting upset. The whole time we were playing he kept looking around the corner or hovered over us felt like we were stealing or vandalizing the place but we were not!! \\nThen he comes over and re fills lol the water at the water hole all pisses off ... I'm sorry sir you close at 12 and it is not 12 calm down. \\n\\nAbout half way through the music shuts off && we begin to hear vacuuming ... Again feeling rushed we started to hurry.

Talk about a place with giant weight scales, hospital gowns for its consumers, waitresses in skimpy nurse outfits, XL wheelchairs, witty pop art that grace the walls and an unbelievable shout out to all 350lb heavy-weighters who can dine for free! Sounds like fun... Sounds like Vegas!  With a name like \\\"HAG\\\", I'm definitely not dinging them for how much fat is packed into their food.  Coming out of this joint in a state of food-coma and lard oozing out of your pours is a given.  Call me self-righteous, but I'm dinging them because I felt that there was no content that backed their concept. \\n\\nI would expect that the unhealthiest burger known to mankind would also be the tastiest.. but their claim to fame simply did not meet my expectations.  The burger bun was stale and dry, not even a trace of flavor could be found on the patty and the burger altogether along with the grilled onions, bacon and cheese was a $7 bunch o' bull. Another on my hit list was the fries (deep fried in lard) with cheese and chili.  Again, I have no animosity against the lard.. it was the fact that they had the nerve to call the item \\\"chili-cheese fries\\\"!  The chili had the texture of diarrhea and the oil drenched, browned, curdled fries were more saturated in lard then fried.  Once again, not a trace of flavor.  If you are coating your meal with catsup and mustard, you know you have a problem.  Props to their extensive beer line-up, but if you are not into drinking, your only choices are glass bottled coca-cola and/or bottled water which will run you about $3+.  \\n\\nThe service was good, quick and easy.. but if you are in a skimpy nurses outfit dressing your patients in hospital gowns, I would've expected a little bit more enthusiasm from the servers as they are constantly bombarded with an array of one-liners from the customers like, \\\"Hellllloooo Nurse! Do I need to bend down for this examination?\\\" But they themselves seemed bored out of their minds as if one too many puns came along their way.  Once again.. Flavorless.

Had family and friends going in every morning at 6 am, motivating each other! You could say we had our Crossfit family. We all knew each other, got close with all the trainers and more. I signed a membership with CAC and had a contract with them which I totally understand but after weeks of not going due to a busy schedule at work I froze my account, so they didn't charge me for about 6 months or so until September 11th, 2014 if I am correct. Now I had a concern so I called CAC and they told me that my account was unfrozen and that they would charge me and it was apart of the contract. I also told the guy that I wanted to cancel my account and he specifically told that he would take care of it and made sure that I wouldn't get charged another $150 in the same month... Guess what?! I got charged another 150 in the same month! (My regular due date is on the 25th of each month) I was charged on the 11th of September and tonight which is the 25th. I also called up there to handle the situation 3 times and was told  that I would get a call back and never got a call back from anyone from City Athletic Club.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Flying into town on business, this was my first stop before I even made it to the resort.

I know that probably doesn't make any sense, but if you've read my reviews and you trust my opinion, do it.  It's a chimi stuffed with the most amazing meat, topped with both their famous red and green sauces.  Hot and spicy!  Yum!  \\n\\nDrinks.  Oh boy.  Big and refreshing.  I had what the referred to as a \\\"kick ass\\\" margarita.  My bestie had a sangria margarita and another friend had something with \\\"dog\\\" in the title.  It was a frozen margarita with a Corona in it.  I've been down that road before.  I decided to stick with the \\\"kick ass\\\" margs.

Eh...ummm let's see where to start? My mom always says to start with the good...\\n\\nSo here goes: \\n\\nThe problem was not with the service. I was warmly greeted by the hostess and showed to my lovely date. Our waiter and his trainer arrived to our table within minutes and were both very attentive and pleasant. They offered up some great suggestions and were extremely patient while we chatted and reviewed the menu. Also, major kudos to all the other waiters and staff that buzzed around the restaurant picking up empty plates, refilling glasses and just making sure we were having a good time. \\n\\n HOWEVER....the service aside the food and ambiance just didn't do it for me.\\n\\nBiscuits: They were just okay.  (I know, I know....blasphemy)  My major issue was that they were not warm and flaky. I also wasn't a fan of the salt and pepper crust and the blueberry jam was just average. I mean it wasn't the worse I've ever had but I'm not running back for them either. \\n\\nAppalachian Egg Rolls: Again they were just okay. I'm a fan of shredded pork and greens and I figured rolled in an eggroll and fried my mind would have been...blown. And that just didn't happen.  I like the concept but I certainly wouldn't recommend them especially for the price. \\n\\nCatfish and Goat Cheese Grits: I've got to be brutally honest here:  I'm a new fan of grits. But I'm a longtime fan of goat cheese. And these grits were an epic fail for me. Perhaps, it's because I've been spoiled by the grits at Flying Biscuit (ahhhh...creamy, dreamy goodness)...but these grits were far from that. I found them to be a bit hard and chunky. Ewww. Let's hope I just got the end of a delicious batch....who knows!?  I also wasn't a fan of the catfish. Where was the seasoning? I asked for a side of the jalapeno aioli which I'd hoped would have kicked it up a notch. But was promptly told not to let the name fool me because that that was not spicy at all....say what!? Instead, they suggested the lemon cherry pepper aioli...and that didn't do it for me either....AND they charged me EXTRA for it. Ugh. \\n\\nBanana Pudding: Now, this was pretty tasty. But after not eating most of the meal it wasn't enough to convert me over as a fan. \\n\\nI'll give them some time to become \\\"old news\\\" in Charlotte and then give them another try....maybe for breakfast or brunch. But for now, it's not up there on my list of places to return any time soon.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Hmmm, Mix is more like a 3.5...\\n\\nThe atmosphere, decor, views etc, are amazing! The view overlooking the strip at night is really pretty fantastic.\\n\\nThe service was so so. We sat in the lounge before dinner, and we could not get service and the place was not very busy. The dinner service was decent and our server was a nice guy, he was just slow. And towards the end of the night, he was downright holding us hostage.\\n\\nFood was hit and miss... For apps, we had the tuna tartar and the shrimp cocktail. The tuna was pretty good. They could have had a few more \\\"chips\\\" on the plate. The shrimp cocktail was more like a salad. It was unique and delicious.\\n\\nFor dinner, we had sea bass and filet, and mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. The sea bass was ok. Filet was good. I ordered the filet with pepper crusted with a side of black pepper corn sauce. That was pretty tasty. The mac and cheese was sooooo yummy, and quite frankly, the highlight of this meal. The mashed potatoes were decent. The creamed spinach was forgettable.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the candy bar. It was a hazelnutty delight topped off with a lime coconut sorbet. \\n\\nAll in all, we spent about $115 per person, not including tip. The experience was fun and definitely \\\"Vegas\\\", but I have had much better dining experiences (in Vegas and outside of Vegas) for the price, and for much less.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "index": "4", "compressed_output": {"compressed_prompt": "Sentence: Best in class.

The girl that was doing my moms pedicure cut my moms toes a couple of times with the cuticle tool, my mom said it hurt, flinched a couple of times, and the girl I think figured out she was hurting her.

She finally finished my moms toes, as she was putting my moms shoes on she screwed up a nail, had to redo it and we finally left.

And to be honest, the espresso I had at Gallup (soon to be Crescendo Espresso Bar and Music Cafe!!!!!) was probably the best I have ever had. Which is saying something, because I've tried some amazing coffee in my time in Rome, Paris, and of course Zingermans in Ann Arbor, MI.\\n\\nThe tiny little cup filled with dark, rich, and bold espresso smelled heavenly and tasted even better.

In fact, this was the ONLY Spongebob cake on their website I could find under cakes for boys but it would have gone perfectly. So I got in my car this morning to order it, I wanted to go in because we preferred to just have it in a sheet cake and no cupcakes. \\n\\nSo I sit down and tell the lady which cake I wanted. She looked on her computer and showed me a cake that was a yellow Spongebob cake with no decorations. I said no, the one I wanted was on their website. So she looked some more and showed me a different one that was similar but much darker that the one on the website, so I told her no, the one I saw was more pastel colors. So then she goes to the website and pulled up the cake I wanted, I said yes that was the right cake. \\n\\nShe then proceeded to tell me that the customer who had that cake must have been the ones who brought in the decorations because she had never seen those decorations in the back. She went to the back to check and came back with one, YES ONE, plastic Spongebob figure, and said that's the only decoration they had. \\nSo now, not only was I unable to get the cake that I wanted I couldn't even get the other one that had decorations on it.\\n\\nIt's very bad business that  they advertised a cake on their website that they couldn't even do and then show me a different cake that they still couldn't even do.

Still fuming about our \\\"experience\\\". It was our first time so we did no come in the front door, but rather an entrance by the bar. After scoping the situation, we asked the HOST if we could sit at one of the high tops in the bar area. Sure! We sat 5 minutes without being greeted. Watched the host lean on things and banter with staff. A server came by with a plate of onion rings \\\"Onion rings?\\\" she asked. Nope, not us. Next table, nope. Third table was a winner. Also saw another server come out of kitchen with a plate of food in each hand, walk slowly toward the dining area, looked bewildered, and went back into kitchen. I KNOW you have only been open 3 weeks, but I would START with table numbers, Nimbus. Our server finally arrived in a very casual manner. We ordered waters and 2 beers. Table next to us ordered another round, they got served first. We thought it was strange that there were no coasters or bevnaps. It was also hard to believe the let their hostess come in looking slovenly, wearing a wife beater with exposed, dirty, twisted bra straps, jeans, and dirty tennis shoes. While our server came back to our table, the manager joined him and said, \\\"well, at least you got this table water.\\\" We asked if they had coasters, he said he just hadn't brought any cocktail napkins. I asked if  they could adjust the air, I could hear/feel the A/C blowing at 7pm at night. She said no. I asked if she was the GM and she said \\\"no, I'm just a lttle peon manager-\\\" and flittled away. Our 2nd round took a while and when arrived had lost it's head and was down 1/2 inch from the top. Sorry Nimbus, I love you in Tucson. We were fully planning on eating here, the food looked decent, we could see the kitchen from where we sat and they seemed to be keeping up quite well. the beer was good. If I started a new business, I would overstaff and give servers 2 or 3 tables until you got dialed in. You were obviously overwhelmed.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Love this place.

Fortunately, we purchased the tickets at Tix 4 Tonight so they were discounted.  We never want to pay full price.  The seats were okay.  I didn't really like the setup of the theater.  The seating is by table and our table was about a foot wide so your date is next to you, which is fine (you can hold hands), but not too fine if you're not at the head of the table.  I had to sit behind a very tall man and had to keep moving from side to side to see the stage.  The performers themselves were good, not great.  I feel that the original Bee Gees had such effortless harmonies and these guys weren't as effortless (okay, okay, that's what my husband felt).  I was a little bored, but I feel it's a bit unfair as I was there for my husband.  In the end, he was a little disappointed that this tribute band didn't reach the depths of the originals, but overall, it wasn't bad.  I would not go again, but I don't mind recommending it to a Bee Gees fan since it's a good pass time and an inexpensive cost (especially if you purchase through a ticket broker).\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I ordered online.

I had tried each one there, some more than once....but this was new, uncharted territory for me and I was ready to experience it.    Reading the menu I didn't know what to expect  most if not all their sandwiches are $8.  Eight dollars for a biscuit sandwich I thought imagining some Pillsbury Grands Sized Biscuit or a KFC Biscuit.  But I thought what the heck, it is my goal to give every Truck a chance.  I ordered the Chicken, bacon cheddar and Gravy sandwich, and I was reassured by the young lady taking my order that I made a wise choice as that is one of their most popular.  \\n\\nAs I took a spot near the Pick-Up window,  I glance over to see another persons order....HOLY SH*T....is that the Sandwich?!   It was HUUUGE.  Shortly there after my name was called and I picked up my own piece of history.  Little did I know then that I would be quite taken with Old Dixie's.  \\n\\nThe biscuit , thick and the perfect balance between soft and sturdy enough to be a sandwich.  The chicken was a moist generous piece of crispy fried chicken breast.  This was then topped with a creamy authentic country gravy, thick smokey well cooked (not to much not too little) bacon and a slice of cheddar cheese.  LOVE....\\nI took on this sandwich with a Knife and Fork....and had to save half for later.\\n\\nSince that day I have also tried their Carolina Pulled Pork Biscuit Sandwich.

The place hasn't changed much on the outside, and the inside looks about the same as well. It is possible that even the menu and staff haven't changed much either.\\n\\nThe line can also get a bit crazy at times - there seems to be one almost any time you go by the place, at least in the morning hours (for whatever reason, we don't get by the area much later in the day). Nothing wrong with that - we can use more breakfast places in the area.\\n\\nService is generally friendly, without being overly in your face or leaving you wanting, which is a good thing. The menu, as dated as it may be, is fairly uninspiring. There isn't much here that you will be thinking about once you leave, but it's not bad either. Just a simple, solid menu that will typically fill you up and get you on your way.\\n\\nFor those of you that do recall the Tryon House, this isn't it. Where you use to have food piled high (or wide, in the case of a few dishes), you'll come up a bit short. You won't have a problem getting full here, but you may not have quite as much to go as you used to get at the old place. Still not a bad deal if you just want some standard American fare without much surprise to the food or the bill.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Great place to eat lunch and get a cup of coffee or ice cream.

I ordered the \\\"meatball\\\" sub with the normal toppings, onion, peppers, cheese. \\nWhen I brought the sub home I was really excited to try it, then the dissapointment came. The bread was just ok it didn't look baked fresh, it seemed to be a kind of roll you buy at your local market that was split in half, not actual sub roll. The meatballs were sitting in what appeared to be canned crushed tomatoes, no seasoning nothing, it was pretty gross, no real italian marinara, then it had sliced onion, which was not cooked, then whatever cheese that seemed to be on it was only on the side of the sub. The meatballs tasted like the frozen kind you buy at the store and tasted like they where rehydrated and soaked in water, they were dry, bland and just plain gross.\\n After only a couple of bites I was grossed out by the whole thing,  I turned and gave it to my dog.  \\n\\nSub Factory was a total waste of my money and time.\\n\\nNote: \\nWhen you own a little independant food chain , you are supposed to \\\"kick butt\\\" and go the extra mile with your food, and your customers.

I am a big fan of Indian food and a big a cheap skate so Sree Foods was a perfect fit for me.\\n\\nThis place is no BS and the most unpretentious hole in the wall kind of dive you'll ever find. You go in with $5 and you get a styrofoam container and an elderly Indian lady gives you a big heep of amazing vegan Indian food. There's usually three vegan dishes and one chicken dish. They give you a little bit of all of the available dishes and throw it together in one container. They finally then throw in a piece of naan that is like the Indian equivalent of Wonder Bread but the great dishes make up for it.\\n\\nIt is a cash only spot and like I said, just $5 for this daily lunch special, and $1 extra for a pop. One thing to beware of is that they fill up your styrofoam container to the max. Sometimes the food starts to leak out, so if you don't want an unnecessary dry cleaner run, be careful.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Had some family in town, so we had planned to go to Inka Fest as I'd been meaning to try it for awhile. Unfortunately Inka Fest closed by the Health Department (crazy)! This place was next door, so we ended up here instead. Overall, I'd say the food here was pretty average but the service was very good.  I ordered the beef Pad Gra Prao, the server asked me for how hot on a scale of 1-10, I asked for a 7. Several of our party ordered a curry and asked for a heat level of 4. My dish was ok and spicy, but not as spicy as that curry, theirs was definitely a lot hotter than mine.

I had a car they had serviced for years and they told me they had no clue what was wrong with it. Shocking, as they had worked on this car for years.

While some say their trademark frozen hot chocolate is overrated,  I say NAY! I sprung for the original frozen hot chocolate while my friends ordered an oreo and peanut butter one. It arrived to us overflowing, good thing there was a bowl at the bottom to make sure you got your money's worth ($11). The chocolatey medley with the whip cream and chocolate shavings made me go on quite the sugar high. So refreshing.\\n\\nI also ordered the Las Vegas dog. Complete with your choice of fries, sweet potato fries or coleslaw this dog was huge!! Topped with cheesy goodness and jalapeno pepper slices, I ended up tapping out with only devouring half of it. Sad face. I wish I had it now. Yums.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that the wait wasn't too bad during the lunchtime rush. 20 to 30 minutes didn't seem so bad when I've waited longer for our local CPK restaurant (lame).

{"prompt": "Sentence: Me and my girlfriend were in Vegas just before Labor Day and staying at the Bellagio was something we were looking forward to as we had 3 full days to size it up. Prices for rooms are going to vary widely, of course, but in general, the value for money perception is going to depend more on what you immediately want from your hotel: in short, Bellagio is perfectly placed on the Vegas Strip and is ostentatious about its luxury. The lobby is gorgeous and expansive, with beautiful overhead artwork looking like glossy flower petals, and the balloons behind the receptionist staff is always impressive. I especially loved how the garden is centrally located and, a 1 minute walk from the check-in area, smells fresh and alive with changing displays and landscape architecture. There was a piano bar and many (albeit expensive) options for food around.\\nBe sure to read the fine print about what is defined as \\\"spa services\\\" here. This hotel has a \\\"resort fee\\\" that is similar to other M-Life hotels (MGM, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage to name a few) in that it covers nothing other Wi-Fi, a swimming pool and complimentary boarding pass printouts from the Concierge, and that's it. You must pay $30 a day, a PERSON, to use the spa that has bathrobes and steam rooms, and then of course, if you purchase a massage service or something along those lines, it becomes complimentary. However, after stating our case to the spa people, we both got 3 days complimentarily! So we definitely felt hooked up, but it took some effort.\\nThe room itself is beautiful, maybe overhyped as far as space and amenities (for example, you have no way of using the fridge as it is there to merely provide a store for overpriced refreshments), but the view of the fountains, especially at night, is worth it. You will hear \\\"Luck Be a Lady\\\" over and over at night, but the first time you see it will be a true joy only available in Vegas. \\nAnother thing you should know about, which applies to Vegas in general, is the extent to which you will need taxis. If you choose to walk and avoid the expense of taxis, your feet will pay for it, and the heat will be an additional burden. Leaving the Bellagio from your hotel room to make it to the next closest hotel, perhaps Caesar's Palace, will take you a full 15 minutes of fast, intentional walking---and that's just LEAVING! Think about that if you like casino-hopping, you *will* pay the price.\\nOther than that, Bellagio will be good to you and if you can secure a good deal, it will be memorable, even if you elect not to stay there again.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I had the three ring binder burger since I love onion rings but didn't want to order the actual onion rings appetizer because that was too much to consume.

Also, it felt like a college cafeteria: the stereo was loudly playing poppy dance, hip-hop, and rock songs. So I'm getting a whole bunch of pop lyrics layered with everyone around me shouting over the music. I could barely hear my wife right across the table. There seemed to be a cool breeze blowing across my legs from somewhere. Perhaps it was from the 8 inch hole in the wall behind us. \\n\\nThe food was greasy, yet satisfying.

Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. \\n\\nNote: I will update my review if I need to go back.\\n\\nNow to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nAs another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.\\n\\nSo then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \\\"stethoscope to the heart and back\\\" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.\\n\\nHere's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.\\n\\nEIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!\\n\\nSo I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I ordered a cheese pizza and  it was horrible!

Their omelette station is wonderful since you can get something fresh and to your liking (I also like all their fresh vegetable selections). The bacon, Potatoes O'Brien, and corn beef hash tend to be good as well. Nothing is stellar nor consistent in taste, so currently not my choice of dining. It is perfect for a quick, casual, inexpensive meal for a group without having to decide what everyone wants to eat. Service is usually really good.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I went in to get a small hole in the center of the tread repaired on a new tire.

It really is a limited section, covering only Baked Ziti, Lasagna and spagetti and meatballs. I chose the baked Ziti with garlic bread for $8.50 and threw in 2 homemade meatballs at $1.50. WAsn't expecting much because of the small selection, but everything turned out decent. The meatballs were actually baked into the pasta, instead of on the side which was a nice touch, but overall the dish could have used more sauce. Besides that the ricotta and mozzarella were all present and the thing was well baked. Pretty tasty and a good two big solid pieces of garlic bread, which for a change lasted throughout the whole pasta meal.

Let me tell you... the fruit bowl was nasty. Don't order it.  Food was great, i love the stripper theme, that's always hot for a bunch of drunk people. The worst part about this place is that no taxi's will pick you up from here so beware... come here with caution if you're drunk!

Also, on two separate occasions I called and made a to go order, being told the food would be ready in 15-20 min. I arrived on both occasions 20 min later where they immediately collect payment and say it is almost ready. Then I waited another 25 min both times, for 1 roll! The second time the roll was wrong and I decided I am never going back.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: First time to Montreal. Was there as part of a conference that was going on there during the week, but was able to convince my friends to join me there for a weekend of debauchery and mayhem...alright, I'm not that young anymore, but it was supposed to be a good guys trip. So what do guys eat on a guy's trip...steak..... \\n\\nI actually wanted to go to Au pied de Cochon, but they were booked for days. So this was the next best place, well at least accordingly to Yelp. I wasn't quite sure about this place so asked everyone I met about this place to get an opinion. One person I talked to was telling me that the steaks are so great, that when you drive up, they park your car for you. ????? That is called valet service and what the heck does that have to do with steak? \\n\\nSo there are four of us. We get there at 9pm. Busy, but most people finishing. The place reminded me of the Brooklyn in Seattle. Pretty neat how they have the meat locker on the side and a grand staircase going up to the next level just in the back. \\n\\nThe first thing I notice is that the dry aged steaks are hung up in a locker and seem to be cut when ordered. \\n\\nThe service upon sitting was fantastic. We had three waiters buzzing around us at any one time. So can't ding them on service. \\n\\nAs we prepared to order, they went through the standard spiel on how meat is aged, wagyu beef, marbling, blah blah blah. I really hate hearing this, but I guess that is what you get when you go to steakhouses these days. (Well, you don't get this at the Met. They seem to assume you're there because you know your meat else you would ask. YES...I'm biased). All the beef was American less the Wagyu which was from Australia for some reason. \\n\\nI honestly can't remember the sides being too extravagant. I know we had some roasted garlic mashed potatoes and some other green vegetables, but by the fact that I don't remember is probably an indicator that I was either too drunk or didn't think they were worth remembering. I'm sure it was the latter. \\n\\nTwo buddies ordered the Porterhouse and myself and the fourth ordered the Kansas rib-eye. Yes, Medium rare. \\n\\nThe steaks came. Presentation was standard. Grilled to order. Nothing different. Took the first bite....nothing. Just a chunk of rib-eye grilled to medium rare. I believe I had to add some salt to it because it didn't have any flavor. \\n\\nThe porterhouses were just okay too according to my carnivorous friends. One really liked it, but he isn't too discerning about food, so will have to toss out his judgement. \\n\\nThe prices were pretty high too, so not sure why the high prices for such low quality preparation. The cuts sounded great, but again, anyone can buy the meat, not everyone can cook it. \\n\\nWe were rather disappointed by the food, but fortunately, the only reason they got two stars is that they have a cigar room for you to wash away the taste of the bland steak with a nice Cohiba Siglo VI and a single malt neat. \\n\\nIf you have to eat here, then ask for a spot upstairs. It is more happening. When you order, ask if they could send the valet to Schwartz's to pick up some real cuts of meat or just share a couple appetizers and then head straight for the cigar room.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Went back again- my expectations were too high the first time. On a second opinion, this is an excellent noodle house.

Still, they coooould appear a little neater but I guess this has become part of the PJ experience.

I just ordered a package from Amazon that I have to have for Sunday, paid Amazon for overnight and now Ontrac are scheduled to get it to me on Monday, albeit that Amazon got it out to them right away. To make matters worse the CSR tried to blame amazon for the delay. Amazon, are you listening - these clowns are going to cost you business. I for one will return to big box stores if you insist on using this outfit. Stick with Fedex, UPS and DHL, they do you justice.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Took a dress and some pants for dry cleaning. The lady at the counter and I had some difficulty understanding each other. It took about three minutes (and as many tries) just to give her my phone number. Then she wanted my name. I handed her my license to save time, but she didn't have her glasses on. Augh.\\n\\nFinally got a chance to ask about a dress that had a broken zipper pull. She said they'd have to replace the zipper. Why would anyone replace an entire zipper just because the pull has broken off? I was tired of using a paper clip in its place. I just want a zipper pull.\\n\\nShe quoted me $4.95 to dry clean the pants and to expect a call from the woman in charge of alterations for a quote on the dress. No thanks. I will go to my cheap dry cleaner and find someone who can install a darn zipper pull.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The 1st thing that stands out to me about this place is the service. I was there to just peruse the mountain bikes as I'm looking for a good hobby. I was just checking out the Specialized mountain bikes, which they have a ton of, & a salesman approached me. Usually I hate this scenario, especially when I have no idea what I'm looking for, but this employee really helped me out. He talked about what I might need & what I need to look for. If I had enough money to purchase the bike I wanted, then he would have had a sale.\\n\\nBikeSource has a large selection from beginner bikes to really expensive ones. They also have a bike repair shop & they were working on quite a few bikes while I was there. Their apparel selection is a little limited, but they still seem to have all of the essentials whether you are a novice or an expert.\\n\\nSo when I garner enough cash to get the bike I want, I'll head back to BikeSource to purchase. They have great service & a great selection of bikes, especially if you're looking for Specialized bikes.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I have been to Aunt Chilada's a few times in my Arizona days. \\n\\nThe most memorable, however, was when one of my friends and I pulled a Little Mermaid and combed our hair with plastic forks before dining here. and i believe we combed our hair with a fork shortly after making a hillbilly joke. ironic :) I don't remember why we looked so horrible but we obviously thought it was bad enough to need to comb our hair with a fork. \\n\\n\\nanyway, the food here has never been memorable or terrible. more like a 'i won't complain if you let me sit on the patio and drink margaritas' \\n\\nit is definitely a 'meh' experience, but not gross....and probably the best mexican restaurant option if you're in that area. so for that, i am giving it 1 extra star.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Ate here for the 2nd time last night.

We were impressed with the food, and enormous servings, however the service was mediocre. Our server was trying to handle too many tables and seemed over-whelmed.

The race itself?  Boring, boring, boring, as usual.  Reminds me of Talladega or Daytona where I only need to watch the last 10 minutes.  It was a sellout according to LVMS, but MANY seats were empty, and it was a perfect day.  Sellout?  Who are you kidding?  I didn't pay for my tickets, I got them for free from a company I know.  You could have gotten tickets on craigslist for cheaper than LVMS' retail price.  I'm sure many were given away and sold by their bearers.   Judging by the emptiness of the LVMS RV infield, I'd say greed is finally starting to take its toll on your ridiculous prices for RV spots, in addition to ticket prices (no longer can you get a pre-race pit pass--it's called a 'driver introduction pass' now for a 'mere' $75).  I paid $25 for my Saturday ticket in Phoenix and $60 for Sunday's.  Huge difference, huh?  And we won't even get into traffic egress out of the track. *15* years later and it's STILL a disaster.  I didn't even get into my car until 2 hours and 20 minutes AFTER the race ended, and it still took me  almost 3 hours to get out and get home to Henderson.  This was AFTER I went to a particular exit according to the directions the speedway left on my windshield.  Right behind the NHP officer was a large 10' x 8' flashing sign that said \\\"right turns ok\\\" but I was not allowed.  I was forced to turn left and go to the Apex ramp to get onto I15.  Not having seen it move for the over two hours I waited to GO to my car, I drove north to Moapa and via Lake mead I finally reached my destination in Henderson, convinced I got home earlier than I would have on the slow crawl of I15.  I was in a crosswalk near the entry gates before the race and almost got run over by an overzealous wannabe NASCAR driver dressed as a security guard in an LVMS track vehicle?  Good thing I was paying attention.  He was busy impressing us all with his gangster seat leaned way back and his shades on and music blasting, driving like he owned the place.  Oh and by the way, since no one at LVMS give's a shit about this forum, I'm sure my comments will be ignored, like most local racers' usually are.  Trust me, O. Bruton Smith will hear from me this time soon enough on these issues, and many more. \\n\\nNow Phoenix?  THAT's almost always a sellout for sure for Sunday's race.  PHX RV infield was packed (not one spot empty) and on the outside of the track you could see RVs till the cows came home! I'd rather drive to Phoenix and get more bang for my buck than come to a NASCAR event here ever again.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: 1. Krave, you're awesome for being a gay club on the strip.

So thank gosh for Udupi Caf\\u00e9, a tasty Tempe spot that just so happens to be less than a mile away from the all-vegan Green.\\n\\nUdupi serves a wide variety of Indian food that, unless you're familiar with the type of cuisine, will require some translation help when ordering.\\n\\nBe warned: the portions here are huge, which rocks, considering the dirt cheap prices.\\n\\nI got the Sambar Vada, which are fried lentil donuts you can dip in a spicy sauce. I also got Paneer Pakora, fried cheese, and Poori, big, fluffy bread.\\n\\nGo here for the food. The ambiance is simple, and the tables aren't exactly the comfiest. The service is also lacking (last night, like many times, I waited more than 10 minutes for a soda refill.)\\n\\nBut Udupi hits the spot for a satisfying, healthy, ethnic meal.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Serendipity is having an appointment at my nearby optometrist and discovering that the new Rice Trax location is open! I'm a huge fan of Rice Trax, so I couldn't pass it up.\\n\\nThe food is just as good as I remember. I ordered the Mochiko Bento. Obviously, it comes with Mochiko Chicken and adds two Teriyaki Beef skewers, two Chicken Katsu skewers, and a couple of Shrimp Tempura. This is all served on a bed of rice with some salad on the side. It's always too much food and I had enough willpower this time to only eat about half of the bento.\\n\\nNo longer tucked at the back of an obscure shopping complex, the new location is much easier to find. It's right by DQ on the southwest corner of Rainbow and Robindale. The interior is bright and welcoming. The employees are friendly.\\n\\nThis is all great news.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: My boyfriend and I finally ventured in during an afternoon.  We had been wanting to go here; however, our work hours never seemed to coordinate with their restaurant hours.\\nUpon entering (which is in the sub-ground store right next store to Girasole), it's very quaint, comfortable, and homey.  It's as if you just walked into one of your beachy artsy friend's very over-sized dining room where they happen to want to serve everyone in the neighborhood.  It's a great mixture of at-home coziness mixed with your favorite Beach House. You can either order things To Go at the counter, or sit-down and be served.\\nWe chose to sit down and get the service treatment.  Our server was very friendly and explained the entrees and smoothies.  Exactly what Iliana C. says in her review, the menu has a nice mixture of meat-friendly and veggie-friendly options.  \\nWe started off with Smoothies; I had the Purple Rain (apple juice, mango, banana, blueberry, & pineapple), and Jordan had The Energizer (apple juice, blueberry, raspberry, kale & spirulina).  Both of the smoothies were extremely delicious and you could tell they were made with fresh ingredients over sugars and syrups.  Both of the smoothies were bursting with flavor, but by the speed in which we drank them, The Energizer won that taste test! \\nI then had the Turkey Avocado panini with a side of black bean and corn salsa with tortilla chips.  OMG - I loved this sandwich.  I love simplicity - and this sandwich is just that.  Simple.  Flavorful.  Satisfying.  Plus, the black bean and corn salsa, again, was the most refreshing salsa I've ever tried (besides my own).  \\nI have tried Planet Smoothie down the street.  The difference?  The quality of the ingredients.  Planet Smoothie is good.  JBC is GREAT!  \\nThe worst part about this place, is that it is currently closed for renovating.  However, I can be patient because our server informed us upon re-opening that JBC will be extending their hours into the evening for Dinner, and will offer more raw and vegan options than before.  Can't wait to go back and try all the new things!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I have never been treated so rudely as I was at Narcisse.  But let me start from the beginning.  My husband and I went there for drinks after dinner on Saturday night and at first I was shocked that they made everyone wait in line when there was clearly plenty of room inside.  Secondly, it was odd that there were two young children around age 7 or 8 working the door along side the doormen.  I assume they are the owners kids, and they were adorable kids, but the last thing I want to see at a bar/lounge/nightclub on a Saturday night are children.  BUT, I can get over that- no big deal.  Once inside I ordered one of the least expensive glasses of champagne for $10 and  I noticed later on the receipt that they charged me double for.  Again, I can get over that.  My husband and I were enjoying our night and before leaving we decided to check the patio out and walked out the side door and walked towards the entrance/exit so we could leave.  As we were making our way to the exit some guy came up to me said 'This is a private party' and I had no idea why he was saying that to me- the first thing that entered my mind was 'why are you telling me that?'  Then he went on to say 'This is a private party and you are going to have to leave.'  Um, what?! There were no sighs or anything at all that indicated we were suddenly in a 'private' area.  We were 5 feet from the door.  As we were leaving the doorman asked us if we had a good time and we said as a matter of fact, we were quite offended that as were were simply walking around and heading to the door another patron took it upon himself to tell us to leave.  I suggested that if an area is designated as a private party that they should have it marked as such.  He said he agreed that it was very rude and that I needed to tell his boss who was 2 feet away.  So I repeated myself to who I assume is the 'head bouncer' and his response was 'well, maybe you two should leave'.  What???? I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of his mouth.  He clearly doesn't have a clue about customer service.  And from reading the other reviews I am certainly not the only person that was treated this way.

The Orleans Arena is where they settled on watching the superbowl.....how they managed to get seats in the suite owners private showing is beyond me, but the open bar and catered food along with the Zamboni rides = priceless! \\nThe Orleans just screams old kitchy Vegas. Their casino seems to be asian themed, as almost all the dealers/cocktailers are asian....which is unusual in Vegas. I mean, being the Orleans I would expect more of a Southern Hospitality, not so much an asian theme....The place needs some better ventilation, because after 5 min inside the casino i reeked of smoke and has having a minor coughing attack. \\nThe outside is really cute, small colorful houses that just scream carnival, the staff however is severely lacking in customer service skills. Our friend told us to go to the ice rink, when we asked the security guard where the ice rink was he laughed at us and said nowhere in Vegas has an ice rink.....ok, maybe arena would have been a better way of asking, but really.....he couldn't make the connection from ice rink to arena with and ice rink? \\nRegardless, I would NEVER stay here, its way too far off strip, and way too old.

My cheif complaint is that I came there with friends, eager to sit down, enjoy art, and talk -- but the music was too loud to even think.  The place is already pretty small, and the whole front half was dominated by a stage/various amplifiers/music equipment/etc.  I like music, but this was overkill -- an acoustic, or folk music vibe would have suited it much better.

NO QUESTION, this was the best food we have had in Vegas (and perhaps ever). Everything, and I mean everything, was just knock your socks off delicious, complex, interesting, and indulgent.  The service was beyond impressive, too.  Everyone knew what everything was, the wait staff was choreographed to negotiate huge trays (with or without food on them) in a way that made the whole operation look like a Balanchine ballet.  So you can imagine how hard it is to find anything to complain about.  The culinary experience was near-flawless.\\n\\nWait a darn minute, what do mean \\\"near\\\"?  Well, two things: (a) the portion sized and (b) the price.\\n\\nI still stand by my statements about the quality.  I had a lobster cooked with uni (sea urchin roe) on a bed of truffle risotto that was to die for.  The problem is that the portion fit on what was basically an oddly-shaped, ramekin-sized soup bowl.  And so it was with the other portions: barely enough to tease your palate, have you humming in delight, and it's gone (who knows, the portions were so small that I suspect evaporation might even be a factor).\\n\\nThen came the bill.  Good grief.  Let me digress: at seating, one of the waiters asked if we wanted to start the evening with some champagne. We said \\\"sure,\\\" to which he replied \\\"white or pink?\\\"  What the heck, \\\"one of each.\\\"  That statement, as it turns out, added $70 to the bill.\\n\\nI'm not going to divulge how much the meal set us back, but I'll give you enough for an educated guess.  Not being able to even think about the 16-course, $495 chef's course, we opted for the $165 prix fixe, which had four courses: amuse bouche, appetizer, entr\\u00e9e, and a thin plate of chocolates for dessert (the bread cart came by before the appetizer, too).  A bottle of Riesling cleared the century mark, you know how much the champagne was, one of the appetizers came with a \\\"surcharge\\\" (I think it was because it had extra truffle or something), and we did have some Hungarian Tokaj to sip with the chocolates.  The term \\\"sticker shock\\\" doesn't quite cover it.\\n\\nI'll end this (my first yelp review) by emphasizing that if I were a person of more affluence (in this case, much more), I would most likely not care about the bill because the food was so good, it would eclipse the expense.  We came, we ate, we enjoyed, we marveled, we learned and we'll most likely never be back.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: the pizza is really good once in awhile, i order their pepperoni and it is really good when it is hot because you can see all the grease floating on top and the cheese is melted and sticks to the roof of my mouth.

It's not as good as Red Rock Climbing Center, but for those of you residing in Henderson, it is closer, cheaper, and more difficult. The climb ratings are a little harder than those at R2C2...

It's worth it.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I really wanted to LOVE this place, but it just didn't happen, unfortunately.  \\nI've been to Vegas many times and have stayed at so-so hotels and really nice upscale hotels.  Every hotel I've stayed at on the strip such as Mandalay Bay, Cosmopolitan, Mirage, and MGM, have exceeded my expectations.  I was really hoping to be Wow'ed by this place as well.\\nThe wow factor began to diminish the moment I got out of my car at The Wynn self-park garage.  It was unclear when I got out of the elevator if I was at The Wynn or at Encore, and even more confusing to find the Check-In counter.  Luckily we were guided by a helpful person in the hall who saw me looking around all confused.  He directed us to go straight ahead and around the wall of the pool area, and as soon as we got there, it was quite obvious  where to check in as there was a long line.  I was actually surprised at how long the line was, considering I've never experienced this at other hotels in Vegas. I had reserved a King Resort Suite and was offered an upgrade to a Panoramic View suite for just $20 more a night.  I was told the view would be amazing, expecially at sunset, so I gladly accepted the upgrade offer.   \\nWe got to our room on the 50th floor, and it was beautifully decorated and I loved the layout, but the view didn't impress me much.  I guess in the hotel's defense, it's just a view of Vegas, nothing too breathtaking to look at, it's not like there is an ocean or anything.  BUT.. I did feel a little insulted that she thought I would appreciate the sunset from a north east facing room.  The sun doesn't set on that side!  I let that go since I was so happy to be in our beautiful suite and didn't need to be at my aunt's wedding til 6:00pm and it was only like 2:45 so I put on my swimming trunks and sun screen and went down to the pool.. the European pool, where it's okay to be topless.  There were no topless ladies there which was okay with me cuz that's not my thing, but I liked the idea of being at a pool where there's no children peeing in the pool and running all over the place making me spill my drink.  \\nThe pool was quite nice but a little on the crowded side and there wasn't much sunlight so I guess I could have saved on the sunscreen.\\nI got back to my room a little after 4:00 to get all prettied up for my aunt's wedding, I popped my keycard in the door and..... nothing.  So I did it again.. still nothing.. uggh, I only had ONE mojito!  Why is this happening?!?!    I tried several times but still no luck so I called my friend who was still down at the pool, just hoping that his key card would work and that he wouldn't think I'm a total idiot for not knowing how to work my key card.   Well, when he tried his.. same thing, nada!  At this point I'm getting a little worried because I really didn't want to be late to the wedding, cuz that's always awkward to walk in behind the bride.  \\nI really didn't want to make a trip all the way down to the front counter (I'd have to look all over for it again and probably wait in line) but luckily there was a courtesy phone by the elevator.  The operator said she'd send someone right up.  This person she sent took awhile to get there, and it was a security guy.  He checked my ID, then tried his own card (as if the two of us couldn't figure out how to use our cards), he tried a few times only to come to the conclusion \\\"Yup, it's dead\\\"  so he called maintenance and assured me someone would be right up.  We waited about 20 mins, then I went down to talk to someone who's answer was \\\"let me talk to the manager about an upgrade\\\"  I'm like \\\"what?!?!  I don't want an upgrade, I just want back in my room\\\"  I couldn't tell him that though because he ran off so fast, also the thought of an upgrade was kinda nice.  He came back a few minutes later to tell me he'd send someone right up.  Long story short, 45 minutes after that, we were finally back in our room and the maintenance guy explained he's the only guy working maintenance on both properties.. he got my sympathy vote, but seriously, it was time for me to be at the wedding already and I hadn't even showered (the wedding was in North Vegas, about a 15-20 minute drive).\\nI ended up skipping the wedding, and felt pretty bad about it but of course I made the most of it since it is Vegas and there is so much to do.\\nTo sum up my experience here: The room was nice and the bed REALLY comfortable, the pool was nice but not as nice as Mandalay or even MGM, and the service was disappointing, I mean, I'm sure hotel room card readers malfunction or \\\"die\\\" from time to time but there should have been more of an effort on the hotel's part to either minimize the inconvenience or even at the very least try to make it up to me (I never got that free upgrade nor did I even get a sincere apology). But then again, maybe I didn't seem upset enough. It's hard to be upset in Vegas. And with that thought, I cannot wait til my next trip to Vegas, but I will not be staying at this hotel.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: My husband and I took a mini vacay to Las Vegas a few weeks ago and we happened to come upon this LUSH store in the Mandalay Place mall (it connects the Luxor and Mandalay Bay, which was convenient since we were staying at the Luxor).  I had always wanted to try a LUSH bubble bath every since I heard Randi B. rave on and on about how awesome they were.  I'm not normally a bath person, but when I realized our hotel room had a jumbo sized bath tub, I knew I had to give it a try.\\n\\nThe service at this place is wonderful!  I was helped by a girl named Aubrey, and she really knows her stuff!!  She was really attentive without being overbearing and I really appreciated that.  I didn't know that their product line was more than soaps and bubble baths - they have a TON of stuff, like moisturizers for your face and lots of other neat products to pamper yourself with.  I went straight to the bath bombs because that is what Randi had talked about, and they even showed me how it worked by giving a demonstration towards the front of the store.  I was hooked after that and decided to get the Sakura Bath Bomb and the Pop in the Bath Bubble Bar.  \\n\\nWe went back to our hotel room and I couldn't wait to get started on the bath.  My husband wanted to go back out to the strip but I couldn't wait and I said \\\"We're in Las Vegas!  Almost everything is open 24/7!!\\\" so he was sweet enough to wait.  Well, after I stepped into the bath, which was seriously like stepping into silk pajamas, I never wanted to get out.  About 30 minutes later, I heard my husband snoozing away on the bed so I decided to stay in longer, and ended up being in there for over 2 hours!  The coolest thing?  My skin wasn't all wrinkled on the fingertips like how it happens when you're in the pool for too long.  \\n\\nYou should definitely give LUSH products a try, and if you're in the Las Vegas area, hit this one up if you want stellar service.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: So far I am not seeing a better solution than Cox Communications.

On my second trip, I tried to do Mexican but was disappointed that they didn't have refried beans (they had black beans instead, but who wants to eat that healthy nonsense?). For dessert, I had two scoops of mint chocolate ice cream.

I arrived late and check in was easy.  I went directly to my room since I had an early breakfast meeting the next morning. My room was clean and I unpacked before brushing my teeth and hitting the \\\"heavenly\\\" bed that I enjoy.  \\n\\nHere was my complaint.  while brushing my teeth I felt a cold tingle on my feet.  I discovered as the water poured out from under the sink that my feet were getting the early splash ( Warning) that something was wrong.  I stopped the water to see that the pipes were disconnected?  Since they were metal pipes this was deliberate by whoever stayed in the room last.  I was too tired to change rooms so I mopped up the water with a few towels ( leaving one for the morning shower) and put the pipes back together as best I could so that I could use the sink to finish brushing and in the morning. I also wedged one of the towels under the pipe so that it would stay together.  It didn't dawn on me until later as to how the cleaning crew wiped up the sink without figuring this one out??\\n\\nWhen I got up I showered and used the sink before leaving for my meeting.  I stopped at the front desk to let them know the issue.   They said that they would send up maintenance while I was out.  I went to my meetings and returned to see that Maintenance had been there and really did nothing on top of what I did.  Oh, except move the towel out to the middle of the floor and replace it with a clean wash cloth from on top of the counter.  What service, wow!  This made me upset since you would have thought that they would have scheduled the room to be cleaned right after the maintenance man visited.  No I came back to a dirty room that was a little worse.  Yes the story gets better.  Vegas is hot in the summer and I had walked back from another hotel that early afternoon and needed to wash my face.  Now that the maintenance had used one of the wash clothes for the pipes I only had one left.  I picked it up to see that it was not very clean.  To say the least I am disappointed in this property.\\n\\nSome good to finish, the staff was helpful ( Front desk) and the price is right ( $119) for a Westin. I would stay here again.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Worst Customer Service I've ever had!\\nI've been to so many nail spots across the valley but this definitely has to be the worst.

But it didn't stop there... she started asking me RUDE questions like \\\"Are you from here? Do you live here? yes, Iive here. I was born here. raised here. Do you want to see a birth certificate? There was about 4 people in the salon and they were ALL asked if they would like a bottle of water. I wasn't asked, of course. I figured the service would be crappy like that. Anyways, she left me in the chair for 10 minutes and when I grabbed my purse to check the time she rushed over to my chair and said \\\"sit here! 5 minute more ok\\\" It literally disgusted me to pay her a tip ughhh WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.

The food was delicious, it was properly timed (in terms of courses). Despite being very busy, our waiter was excellent and the staff was appropriate at checking in on us and quick to bring more salsa/drinks. My boyfriend said several times that this was one of the best Mexican meals he has ever had. I don't know if I agree with that, mostly because I have had too many good Mexican meals...but it definitely was excellent and tasty and I would love to eat here again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: the hostess was a little curt and had a bit of an attitude. She said there was an hour wait (which we understood and were OK with), made it sound like our request to be seated inside was something she probably wouldn't try to do, and said she would call us when a table opened up. An hour later we returned to find our name crossed off. She said she tried to call but it didn't work. My phone was with me and on the entire time we waited. I was receiving emails at that time too so i know it had service. I checked the number she had and it was right. I am thinking she didn't call...despite that little issue I would recommend this place.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We were one of their first ten customers when they opened the downtown Glendale location.

I finally got the opportunity to go on Saturday and I was kind of disappointed at the quantity of art for the price, which is $12 for locals and $15 for tourists. There were pieces on display from artists such as Clemente (one of my favorites),Lichtenstein, Degas, Renoir, and a few from Picasso among others. In the admission price you get an audio reader of sorts to further describe certain pieces of art but the room was literally the size of a 3 bedroom apartment. It's your basic small gallery with wood floors and white walls.  In comparison to museums like the Whitney, MoMa, and Guggenheim the prices are comparable but not the quantity. Of course the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art could never compete in the sizes of those museums, but the prices should reflect the quality and quantity of artwork. I feel like this was the Bellagio's attempt to add to it's ambiance of  refinement by adding this gallery which ended up just feeling like a cheap novelty of a museum. I'd rather go to the Guggenheim next time i'm in New York and get more bang for my buck. But hey, i'm a thrifty girl who usually pays $5 on suggested admission prices so take from that what you will :)\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "index": "13", "compressed_output": {"compressed_prompt": "Sentence: Birthday on a Saturday-  here we go:\\n\\nHad my first \\\"LA Water\\\" here- as strong as an AMF or Long Island but better! $19 but what's new?

{"prompt": "Sentence: Like many places on State Street, Kabul has a nice outdoor patio and that's a huge plus. Given the area, service is pretty good, too. But the food is merely okay. I'm not a fan of the venerable American tradition of soup or salads being included in a meal. The reason being that most places just serve you a pretty mediocre soup or salad and roll the price into the cost of the food that you order. Kabul is no exception; although they had a pretty interesting curry dressing, the vegetables themselves were paltry and slightly bitter.

{"prompt": "Sentence: My belief has always been that at a restaurant, nothing matters but the food.  Service can be abysmal as long as the food is good.  Tandoori Times has changed my beliefs about this, and I now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experience.\\n\\nDinner started innocently enough.  We sat at a table not far from the bar, and our server started out asking us what we'd like to drink.  The server had a young kid with her, maybe 5-6 years old, and the kid was helping her with things.  I thought it was kind of strange, but I assumed it was probably our server's kid and that she couldn't find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deal.\\n\\nI ordered a dirty martini, and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night, even though it was only 6PM).  Since our table was near the bar, we could hear what was going on there, and within a minute or two, I heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was.  After a minute or two of searching, the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice.  At this point, I expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink.  She didn't.  Instead, she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice, and they concluded that saltwater would be good.  Ugh.  She brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong.  I pretended I didn't know any better, took a sip of the drink, and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice.  She acted like she couldn't imagine why this was, and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill.  When she picked the drink up from the table to take it away, the young kid I mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand.  She spilled a bit of it on me, and most of it on the floor.  She then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything.  This spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_, and they never cleaned it up.  When we eventually left, I was tempted to \\\"slip\\\" on it, pretend I severely hurt myself, and start yelling about how careless their staff was, how they could be held liable for injuries, blah blah blah.  I just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled, but it really seemed like they didn't care at all.\\n\\nAnyway, the server asked if I wanted something else to drink instead.  I went for a gin and tonic.  When she got back to the bar, the first thing I heard was \\\"What's in a gin and tonic? How do I make one?\\\" Sigh.  Anyway, the gin and tonic turned out okay, all things considered, but at this point I was pretty sad from what had already happened.\\n\\nFinally, we got to ordering our food.  Our server came over, asked what we'd like, and as we started telling her, we noticed she wasn't paying any attention.  She was just watching her kid and talking to her.  So, we got to repeat our order again, and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down.  Yay.\\n\\nAwhile later, our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer, one chicken), chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and rice.  The naans were pretty average, nothing really special.  The chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good, and was the only decent part of the whole meal.  The palak paneer was some of the worst I've ever had, and I'm pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer.  It tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been added.\\n\\nIn the middle of eating, we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment.  The server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink, and then they walked away.  Congratulations Tandoori Times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortable.\\n\\nOur server didn't seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was, if we needed anything, etc. When we were done eating, she came by and dropped off the check, without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word.  We had been charged an extra $2.50 just to have rice with our entrees, which I think is pretty ridiculous.  Anyway, I took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up, again without saying a word.  We left quickly, wanting to get our Tandoori Times experience over with as soon as possible.\\n\\nWhen we left, I was pretty frustrated and angry, which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant.  I will never, ever, ever come back here again.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Sch\\u00f6n, dass Las Vegas mittlerweile \\u00fcber drei Apple Stores verf\\u00fcgt. Neben dem ersten in der Fashion Mall, einem weiteren in den Forum Shops gibt es auch im Town Square, ca. 1,5 km vom Las Vegas Premium Outlets South entfernt einen Apple Store. Bei meinem heutigen Besuch war der Store gut frequentiert und man musste schon deutlich nach einem freien Verk\\u00e4ufer Ausschau halten. Ich hatte Gl\\u00fcck und traf auf einen, der ausnahmsweise einmal halbwegs einen Plan von den Produkten hatte. Wusste er es nicht bzw. war sich unsicher, gab er es offen zu. Damit kann ich gut leben. Gestern im Apple Store in der Fashion Mall erz\\u00e4hlte die Lady im blauen Shirt mir absoluten Mist. Daran muss Apple insgesamt kr\\u00e4ftig arbeiten, da dieses Ph\\u00e4nomen l\\u00e4nder\\u00fcbergreifen auftritt. Zur\\u00fcck zum Store im Town Square. Auch hier ein typischer Apple Store in der gleichen Aufmachung wie weltweit \\u00fcblich und Applestandard.

Crazy thing is... I moved in right down the street four years ago. I was living back in Tempe after living on the far other side of town for FOUR years, I tried the salon because it was close and looked nice.  While I was getting my pedicure the lady kept asking me if I had been there before, she insisted I had.... I insisted I had not! Finally, it comes up that they used to be at a different location.... And then it clicked! In my early twenties I was literally addicted to pedicures, then I moved away... They remembered me from four years back! Amazing!!! You just don't see many husband and wife businesses anymore these days!  Yes, as other reviews have said... Maybe other locations get you with the flash of the crazy patterned toes, but I go for class, the customer service... And the AWESOME massage! It is wonderful to see them through their growing business, growing family... And they know my Bf and I like we are neighbors! I love this place!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Overpriced airport drinks (but that was expected).  The waiter was friendly though.\\n\\n'nuff said\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: First time coming here, I was hoping for more of a bar type of place. The Garage feels more like a restaurant with a bar.\\n\\nStill, it's hard to beat the happy hour that goes till 7. And just to clarify, there is a sign in the bar that states \\\"First beer is $5.00 minus the price of gas\\\" so that roughly would've been $1.26 last night. However, what the sign does not say is that this special is only good on Monday and Tuesday.\\n\\nAll other nights, the happy hour price of a pint is $3, which is pretty damn good, and the draft beer selection is good too. Had a couple Hop Knot's from Four Peaks.\\n\\nAs for food, we got three appetizers: guacamole and chips, slider trio and buffalo wings. I gotta say I was unimpressed with just about all of it. Being just edible isn't what I was hoping for.\\n\\nBut, this place is just down the road from us and I'd like to give it another try.\\n\\nService was spot on. Our server was really nice and attentive, despite being quite busy. I appreciate that.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Took a day 'adventure' trip with our two children and ended up near South Blvd.  I had driven by this restaurant many times and thought it would be nice to try.  This was on a Monday, so when we arrived about 8pm, it wasn't very crowded.  The d\\u00e9cor is a little over the top, but most steakhouses tend to be that way.  The menu had lots of options, but seemed pricey.  We decided to stay and give it a try.\\n\\nOut of our group, we ordered 2 steaks.  I ordered a large prime rib to split with my wife and my 8 year-old daughter got the kids sirloin (I would guess It was a 4oz steak).  An hour passed and I had gotten my salad and we had gotten some bread and that was about it.  Finally, after another 10-15 minutes, we got our meals.  My daughter's steak was raw and the prime rib was an end cut and was dry and well done through about half of the cut and then a light pink in the very middle only and overall very dry.  Not the way a prime rib should be cooked.\\n\\nI proceeded to tell the waitress about the steaks and she offered to bring us 2 more.  I told her we couldn't wait another hour for our steaks and she said she would get them out as soon as possible.  At this point, the manager/owner came over and told me he thought the prime rib looked fine and he would throw the small sirloin back on the grill.  He also stated that the delay was because they cook the meat to order.  First of all, you don't cook a prime rib to order.  They should already be close to the correct temperature and then finished off as the orders come in.  It was obvious that the piece was cut off an uncooked prime rib that was in the fridge and then put in the oven to cook it quickly and then put on the grill to finish it.  It was cooked and well done on all sides, so there was no cut from the rest of the rib.  My daughter's steak was only 4oz, so how long does that take to cook?  I don't see that it would take an hour for what we ordered, so he tried to tell us something that wasn't true.\\n\\nThe point is that he wanted to argue with me that the prime rib was fine when it was burnt and crusty on the outside and dry on the inside.  He lost that argument as we decided to leave until he handed me a check for a salad, drinks and the side my wife had ordered to go with the prime rib.  Another 15 minutes passed until clearer heads prevailed and the lady at the front told us to not worry about it.\\n\\nI will never come back when he tried to give us a line about the delays and the quality of the food.  You shouldn't offer something you aren't prepared to present with your best quality.  Cutting the end of a prime rib and trying to make it a prime rib in an hour doesn't work and just frustrates your customers.  Don't lie and just tell the truth.  We would have stayed and tried to enjoy our meal if you just hadn't want to come over and argue with us about our meal.\\n\\nPoor customer service, overpriced food for the quality and long waits just aren't worth it.  I would avoid this restaurant.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: When my friend booked this place over the some of the more well known steak places in Las Vegas I was disappointed but it was his birthday so I couldn't object.   After dining at this place, I would definitely go back for the  steak and their sides.   \\n\\nAll of our steaks (party of six) were cooked just as we requested.   The steaks were seasoned perfectly and cut of meat were top quality.  The trio of fries were excellent.   Their sides were as advertised.  Mac and cheese was very decadent  (tastes even better as it cools off and thinkens) and their mash trio was just as delicious.  \\n\\nI would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor service and awful salads.  I will definitely be back for their food minus the salad.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Everything about this place is amazing. The food, drinks, and staff are the best.

Yes there were some 'cool' stunts in the beginning but they had 2 clowns do mini shows in between the acts...I believe they do this so they have enough time to change up the scenery/set up in the background. But the clowns were annoying and their skits took way too long in my opinion. I mean we were yawning. I felt like we didn't get enough of a good show to be worth the ticket prices. Its like when you buy an expensive bouquet of flowers and it comes with too much filler and not enough flowers.

Christopher the bartender was awesome, great service!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I am a huge fan of Cirque de Soleil (i loved La Nouba, O, LOVE) and I was very excited to surprise my girlfriend and take her to see KA on her birthday.  I read the Yelp reviews and they were great, with most people saying this was their favorite show.  I could not have been more dissapointed.  We even had great seats (in the middle, not too close not too far) and the show was slow, boring and confusing.  There were some decent fight scenes and some talented performers but overall it was incredibly boring.  I can't beleive this was made by cirque de solieil and someone actually put it together and said yes this is what I want.  There was a period of about 45 minutes in the middle where we almost fell asleep and wanted to walk out.  The only reason we didn't is beacause I heard so many great things so I kept waiting for it to get better.  It was a joke.  We were in disbelief when it ended.  I felt like I was robbed of my money.  I had a locals discount of $130 for 2 tickets and I still felt robbed.  I wouldn't have even enjoyed it if I paid $20 per ticket.  It was that bad.  Seriously, I have always loved Cirque de soleil shows but this one was so boring.  There were hardly any acrobatics or anything that you couldn't see in a B rated kung fu movie.  The story was also confusing and made no sense.  Don't waste your time or money. Go see the Beatles LOVE show, O or even Absinthe.  They are all much better.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Heard it was good for its seafood so I was super excited to try this place during my visit to Vegas. The inside is dark, but the atmosphere is relaxing and really pretty. I love the location of Olives, because you can see the Bellagio watershow outside the window while you eat. Pretty awesome. \\n\\nStarters: I ordered the Capaccio and was really glad i did. The meat was fresh, and comes with a little salad\\n\\nDishes: I ordered the Halibut. It was okay, i wasn't too impressed with it. My friend who told me to get this dish said the fish is suppose to taste like butter. But it didn't. It was still good. Loved the spinach risotto, it made the whole dish more on the creamy side. \\n\\nThe sea bass on the other hand, tasted like butter. If i could have a do-over, i would order the sea bass. \\n\\nThe ribeye was nothing out of the ordinary, but still delicious.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Sans aucun doute dans mes premiers choix pour le brunch.

A mindless decision on my part.\\n\\nA hint of buyer's remorse trickled up upon checking in on Yelp, then came in a raging torrent of disappointment after taking the first bite. Never knew it was possible to have such bland food. There was no flavor in the bread, meat, onions, or peppers at all, not even in the hot sauce that I added! Were they allergic to salt and spices?\\n\\nI swear I didn't know better, but now I do.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: TI is not one of your new hotels on the strip, the place has been around for more than 25 years now but its still a decent place to stay and its located in the middle of the strip.  The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable.  They have decent bath soaps and shampoo.  The caf\\u00e9 downstairs is ok, average price on the menu is about $15, never tried the buffet but from the looks of it, its just your ordinary buffet, nothing special.  The sports betting room is rather small, most of the room is filled with bench seating with only a few chairs on the side, a lot of people just stand around to watch the games.  Not a lot of people were playing the tables so a lot of them were not open when I went, poker rooms and crap tables were kinda dead too.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We paid for extended check out at 3 pm but were surprised to be locked out of our room at 11:20 for an odd reason.

There is absolutely no reason for a computer system to automatically check someone out when they were told by multiple people beforehand that the extended check out was in place.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: There are a few good things about BWW.  First, the mango habanero sauce is great.  Second, I like playing the trivia game.  Lastly, the beer is reasonably priced and cold.  On the down side, the wings are so small that there has to be a law against killing chickens that young.  The service is hit and miss.  3 out of 4 times the service is fine, but if you get a bad one, it is really bad.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: PNC Park is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Even if you're not a baseball fan (or are disheartened by the Bucs), it's a great place to spend a summer night. It's a super cheap way to be entertained anytime during the summer, especially if you're tired of the relentless bar scene.\\n\\nI had the pleasure of seeing Dave Matthews Band in concert here, and from my third-level seats I might not have been able to see Dave's face, but I had the most beautiful, sweeping view of the downtown skyline and river as the sun set over it. \\n\\nThe park is beautifully designed, with exposed steel beams that fit so well with the heart of Pittsburgh. It's nice to walk around and stretch during games-- the rotunda is a great place to watch, and it's always a beautiful view at night to walk along the river when the game hits a slow point. \\n\\nThe food is pretty good for a ballpark. Much to my surprise, they serve veggie burgers, which is a nice option for vegetarians wanting to partake in traditional baseball park food. Fireworks nights are always impressive, and I enjoyed the show at PNC Park more than the Point fireworks this year, which I watched from Mt. Washington. It's an iconic steel city destination, and you can't call yourself a proper Yinzer until you've been!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I really wanted to like Cafe Costa Rica.  I've been hearing good things about it for years, and when we were looking for a new place to try between a two hour break between film festival screenings, we decided to stop in.\\n\\nI wish we hadn't.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in the basement of a youth hostel.  It is a small space with about half a dozen tables, low ceilings, and delicious smells eminating from the kitchen.  We were seated at a tiny table in the corner.  I sat with my chair slightly blocking the bathroom door.   \\n\\nWe ordered two drinks, a dark and stormy (strong and tasty) and a ginger punch (overly sweet, but not bad).  We had two empanadas to start, which arrived hot out of the fryer after a half an hour wait.  They were very greasy and garnished with a great deal of chopped cilantro.  The flavors were a bit bland.  \\n\\nAfter another half hour wait, our entrees arrived.  I had roast pork with beans and rice.  It could have used something like an extra tortilla to soak up the watery juices from the pork, but was otherwise  unobjectionable.  It could have used some salt, but there was no shaker on the table, and we were never able to summon the server back to ask for one.\\n\\nMy partner had a steak burrito, which was fairly bland and filled with a bitter sauce (mole?).  For the same price he could have had two burritos from Chipotle and finished dinner without worrying about missing our movie.\\n\\nWe spent about $50 for two drinks, two empanadas, a burrito, and a bit of braised pork and beans and rice.  It wasn't worth it.\\n\\nI would recommend this place if you have deep pockets, three hours, and really good company.  And don't mind sitting in a stiflingly hot room.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I like a good stroll through AJ's now and again.  Especially if I am in the search for some specialty or gourmet item.

And I am thinking - $50 couldn't go too wrong.\\nEnter the TWILIGHT Zone.....................\\n\\nOk.   so you have  an English sounding restaurant  but with an Italian Menu, Croatian  Greeter/Manager, a decor that is Southwestern with weird French accents; and such inept waiters who are unbelievable.\\n\\n  Let's start with OUR WAITER.  The manager promptly seats us.\\n10 minutes later, our server appears- very friendly- but immediately announces he hasn't worked in months since working here years ago and we (unfortunately ) are his very first patrons sinc returing to work here!) .   He proceeds to tell us of his  past misfortunes and  subsequent travels around the world.  Meanwhile, we are thirsty and would like (at least some water) and perhaps order a drink.  When he is finished, I asked  what the house wine was - Response - \\\"Gee, I don't know -it use to be Woodbridge but it may have changed.  He just stood there.  I asked- \\\"can you please find out?\\\"  He said \\\"Oh yea - sure\\\".  We also have  no tableware - nor menu.\\nCan you spell I-N-E-P-T? \\n\\nHe came back to take our drink orders and tell us about the drink specials.  I asked if we could see a menu  (mind you we are already  20 minutes into the evening. )  He laughed and attempted to make light of the fact that we had no tableware nor menu.\\n\\nSo while we are waiting - the waiter for the group of 8 women  seated directly behind  us  (from Chicago, based on their very loud conversation) was telling them a story about  God knows what.  He talked very loudly and kept saying  \\\"those Black guys\\\" in his monologue.  There happened to be a couple (black gentleman with his white companion) nearby who could not help but overhear this guy's  very racist dribble and appeared to become very uncomfortable.  The women sat silently and said nothing.  I was about to interrupt him  and tell him that his conversation was rude and to please stop when he ended his rant and left.\\n\\nThe wine list is from HELL- How can a purported fine dining establishment even entertain the thought of having Sutter Home White Zinfandel ($23/bottle)  and Little Penguin Cabernet - ($34/bottle) on the menu?  What a joke - not to mention rip-off\\n \\nAbout the food.......\\nThe veal dishes we had were ok.  Although the veal (Satimboca and Marsala) were tender, both dishes were very salty.  However, the vegetables were fresh and tender and the potato slices tender.  The bread is hot  but nothing to rave over.  We stuck to one glass of red wine each from the Glass Only wine menu as the bottle menu was lacking and way overpriced. \\n We ended  the meal  splitting  the Tiramisou which was very good and supposedly homemade on the premises.\\n\\nBy the time we left @  8:30 p.m. the place was busy with only 3 empty tables. My son and I could not figure out how this place stays in business considering the poor service and mediocre food/overpriced and  low end wine selection.    Bill for two came to $113 and with our $50 coupon ended up paying  $82 (including tip) .  Way overpriced.  \\n\\nTrust me -  we will NEVER return to this TWILIGHT ZONE again and if you are wise you won't even begin to venture into it....\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: The facilities are great, but the spin classes are not good. There are only two spin classes offered in the evenings, one on Tues and one on Thurs.  Dallas, who is in charge of group classes, teaches the Thurs and her idea of motivating her participants is to SCREAM \\\"Push\\\", \\\"Push it!\\\" every 6 seconds. It's the worst spin class I've ever taken in my life and I've taken spin for 15 years. She throws in a few \\\"woo hoo\\\" at the top of her lungs too, all this while being microphoned. She's like a caricature of a class instructor that you would see on an SNL skit from the 80's. For the amount of money I pay for this gym, I expect quality instructors who know how to motivate a class in ways other than screaming the same word over and over for 60 minutes.  There were also no jumps, spinning was not on beat, just up hill and downhill. \\n\\nThe class seats 50 and there were less than ten people in the class which shows you how bad it is.

I once flew from it about 4 years ago and was delayed there for about 7 hours - that was a joy-filled Sunday afternoon I can tell you! But upon arrival it looked like it had had a bit of work done to it and there were a few places that looked half decent. \\n\\nBefore departures there was a Wetherspoons upstairs which I stopped in for a highland Haggis burger (top notch with loads of haggis) and a peppermint tea - not too bad for \\u00a313 overall and from reading the WS magazine, it looks like they're starting to go for quality ingredients as opposed to just cheap eats.

There are so far about, let's say, 2,000 restaurants I had visited throughout my lifetime across the globe.  I had experienced from no service at all to service styles that would leave someone feel so much like a prince or princess.  The restaurants also vary from home dinning to where President Obama and other diplomats would dine at.  None of them, even for the ones provide no service at all, had left me with such a horrific memory.  I had made a reservation at 8p.m. to celebrate the night with my family and friends who came all the way to this seemingly middle of nowhere.  We had arrived a little bit early, waited for at least 10 minutes, asked the others who were waiting, and then been informed that they all had been waiting for at least 30minutes.  One customer told us to find the host wearing white with an apron.  We waited for another 10 minutes to finally found him, then been informed by him that we would have to wait until there is an empty seat.  As a recent grad expecting an exciting and enjoyable dinner, I started to fume up with anger.  Then finally after another 15 minutes, we were being seated.  However, this nightmare did not end then.  We were sitting there for yet another 20 minutes to be finally served with water (and that's after we asked for it).  The server served the water to people next to us who were there later than us first.  Again, the server had our neighbors ordered first before we were allowed to order.  And, we were finally allowed to order after 35 minutes of sitting!  Neither the server, nor the host, was attentive and helpful.  The server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time.  There was also no water being refilled (unlike our neighbor), so we had to head to the bar to get water ourselves.  Nothing much was explained nor bettered throughout our experience.  And the foods were not the best they could be consider the price.  Since we were \\\"forced\\\" to order off the graduation menu costing $35 per person and plus this outlandish experience, we ended up deciding to offer no tip.  We could not grasp the understanding of this horrific experience.  Was it that our crowd did not seem to be as important as the other bigger crowds?  Was it that we looked foreigner and stupid?  Was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation?  Or rather, was it because you guys tend to pretend to be something you are not?  Caf\\u00e9 Luna, you had successfully ruined my graduation celebration.  Thank you SO much for doing so.  I would never ever go there again.\\n\\nIt was truly a nightmare,\\n\\nBy: One of your customer who intends to let everyone know about this incident\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: First time visit. Being a local, I don't go to the Strip that much unless I have friends from out of town or someone I know is celebrating a special occasion there. Tonight I was there for the latter, but I was disappointed. Places like SF make me seriously think I should stick to local places for a night out with friends from now on.\\n\\nWe were told we had to wait until the rest of our party showed up before we could be seated, which I thought was odd because they should have just sat us right away and showed the people who came later to our table. After about a half hour or so we were finally seated. For a Tuesday night it wasn't super busy, so we should have been seated sooner than we were.\\n\\nIt took a while for them to take our order and a long time for our food to arrive. When I got my sandwich, I thought it was very bland and not worth the money I paid for it. When I got my bill I was surprised to see not only did they add the gratuity for our table, but also a franchise fee, which I have never seen before. I have eaten at many Strip restaurants in the past, but this was the first I ever got charged for something extra like that. I ended up paying $40.00 for my sandwich, dessert, and my drink. Way too much, I think, for food that was substandard and service that was equally so.\\n\\nUnfortunately, SF does not live up to the hype and I cannot recommend the restaurant. The dessert was the only thing I liked that I gave one extra star for, but I would say to you, visit the sweet shop and maybe get a cocktail, but nothing else.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: After going to Marquee in the past, I was much more relieved to find out how much more space Encore Beach provided! \\n\\nMy fear of beach clubs began when I went to Marquee last summer and it was literally shoulder to shoulder crowds. It was so bad I couldn't even step foot in the pool!\\n\\nEncore was much more organized and although there were more people you could still find space to move around and take a dip in the pool. Girls are free on guest list but guys have to pay full cover at a ridiculous price of $52. I'm really not sure why the beach club would cost more than the night club but i'm sure glad i'm not a guy! The drinks I heard are also ridiculously expensive so I would load up on some alkie in the casino before heading out to the pool.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I was in Charlotte for a conference.  We ate at Kings Kitchen Wednesday night.  The food was good and we were all pleased with what we ordered.  I thought the portions were small for a \\\"Soul Food\\\" place but none the less it was filling.  We did not have desert because there was nothing that appealed to us.  Why no cobbler, sweet potato pie or even Red Velvet cake was odd to us but maybe they are not known for those offerings.\\n\\nWhere it went bad was the SERVICE!  I gave it 3 stars only for the food The service was terrible.  We had an older gentlemen who acted as if were bothering him asking questions about the menu.  He took his time taking our order and was very slow on bring the drinks.  My friends ordered  wine and it was poured in a beer glass??? He never brought us water until we reminded him on his third trip to the table.  When he brought the food he smelled of cigarette smoke which meant he took some sort of break while our food was cooking.  Not exactable.  Makes me wonder if he even washed his hands upon his return.  Since his service was mediocre at best his tip reflected as such.  Not sure what was going on that night but they were not packed but full and did not seem to have a problem turning over tables but with that kind of service I will pass on my next visit to Charlotte.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: OMG was so happy when they opened in Vegas.

I have always relayed on my brother who is a mechanic at Mazda to service my Mazda for me.  Before moving here my brother did complete check of my car including changing the transmission fluid at 65,000 miles.  I have taken my car to several places to get the oil changed.  Today I needed to have it done again and thought I would go at lunch by work.  I went online and visited their website and even printed a coupon for a complete oil change for $28.99. No hidden cost or shop fees the coupon said.  When I arrived my car was put in line for service. Approximately 45 minutes later a tech can in to tell me that my transmission fluid need to be changed or it was going to burn up.  When I told him I had it done at 65,000 mile at Mazda, the car only has 79,000 miles now, he said that they lied to me and I should go back and get my money back.  Now who should I believe, my brother of 51 years or this 23 year old kid I just met.  I told him that I would take care of the problem myself and he said again, \\\"it better be soon, this car might not make it much longer.\\\"  When I went to pay expecting my bill to be around $30.00 with tax but was informed that it was $35.48.  When I asked the cashier why, she told me that the oil filter is not included in the oil change.  Who does a oil change without changing the filter?  I asked to speak with the manager he was not available.  When I told the tech that I would just pay the bill and not come here again and YELP their business, he said \\\"DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.\\\"  So buyer beware of this place, they will rip you off when ever they can.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Sure, it looks a little more swank than your usual strip mall takeout place. It's so glossy it shines. But the portions are smaller than other similar restaurants, and the prices are higher. I also find the rice and fried items to be somewhat overcooked and dry. Their service is also slooow. Very, very blah.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We had a failed attempt at going to brunch elsewhere so I popped on my app to figure out some of my bookmarks. It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe. \\n\\nThe BF and I shared: \\n\\nChicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be. \\n\\nFajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again. \\n\\nYour breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.\\n\\nYou get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy. \\n\\nSidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette. \\n\\nService was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most \\\"mom and pops\\\" don't make their own sausages or potatoes. \\n\\nWe took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky. \\n\\nEven with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Kind of a small club. There were some outdoor areas but it was too cold to venture out. I was here on a Saturday night, at around 12pm the line was fairly short. Our friends were already there earlier and so we were on the guestlist. We walked right in - past some people who had to pay, hehe. \\n\\nFree clubbing is always fun. $20 drinks are not as. After a bit we went out to one of the bars at the casino to drink, and was able to re-enter into Surrender. \\n\\nDecor-wise, the club is not much compared to XS or Lavo or any of the bigger clubs. The crowd was decent - a lot of youngish people in their 20s. Most of the creepy old guys lurked around the pole dancers. The music was mostly top 40's, with a mix of other genres. \\n\\nQuite enjoyable place for my first Las Vegas clubbing experience.

I went out for dinner last night at the Hilldale branch and had a very bad experience. I was dismayed because it was so atypical to what I usually experience when I visit Laredos.\\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe host, Jesus, was pleasant and friendly! He did an excellent job of seating us and bringing us our chips and salsa. He provided great service and had an awesome attitude. Unfortunately, this is where the good part of my visit ends. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\nOur server, in stark contrast to Jesus, was quite disappointing. First of all, he screwed up my drink order, bringing me a blended Margarita instead of one on the rocks as I had ordered. When I politely sent my drink back, he had a bad attitude about it. The replacement Margarita that he gave me tasted as though it had no alcohol in in. I would not be surprised if this was his way of \\\"getting back at me\\\". This alone really wasn't all that big of a deal and I wouldn't be writing except for what happened next. My dining partner ordered a steak taco salad. He was brought a taco salad with scallops. We told our waiter about the mistake and asked for a steak taco salad. He the proceeded to ARGUE  with us and said that we did order scallops. My companion is actually allergic to seafood, and I can assure you he did not order scallops. The correct salad was eventually brought to us after about 30 minutes, but not after our waiter basically abandoned our table. He stopped refilling our waters, and he never brought us the refill of chips and salsa we requested. And Lord knows what they did to the taco salad. I actually can't believe my companion was brave enough to eat it. We did not leave a tip. Unfortunately, I did not catch the waiter's name, but I wrote an explanation on our receipt as to why there was no tip given. For the record, I generally give 15-20% for average service, and 25% for excellent service. I was just so irked that this waiter ruined our dinner that I couldn't reward him. Finally, the food wasn't up to par. I feel like they've cheapened the quality of their food of late.

If you are the type of person that wants quantity over quality then this is probably your heaven and you should buy the day pass here and eat every meal of day here if you can. On the other hand, if you are a normal person you should probably go to a real restaurant and have 1 nice entree and be very satisfied with your meal. The selection is very diverse but all the food just is not up to the quality of that same item if you got it at a regular restaurant. The food was not bad, just not good. One positive to this is if you don't like something you can always go up and try one of the other 100 dishes that are out there at any given time. Also, the line for this place can get pretty bad, we waited roughly 20 minutes. So if you see a line just skip it and go to another restaurant there is no justification for waiting for this buffet.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Well I never expected to give this buffet a bad review but my experience going to try it did not work out as I had hoped or expected.  It was a weeknight at 8:30pm when we got there with a party of three.  The line was long, just passed the first hostess stand.  I went to the kiosk to \\\"put our name in\\\" and it said to come back at 9pm.  We got in the line that wasn't moving and the host lady came through the line looking at everyone's ticket.  When she got to us she told us to get out of line and come back at 9pm.  That doesn't make sense because by the time we would pay it would have been at least 9pm.  AND the couple in front us had a ticket that said 8:55pm.  So she asked us to get out of line when the people in front of us has a ticket with a 5 minute difference but they were ok.  The lady was so rude, she was short, older, with short gray hair.  We were so disgusted by her rudeness that we left and didn't even eat there.  When you are asking people to pay almost $60 for a buffet you should at least treat them nicely.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: My Wife and I have been wanting to try Donovan's for a very long time.

Definitely not a place where you want to take small kids who are loud.  We were very impressed by the traditional, dark wood decor and bronze western themed statues.\\n\\nIt took a while to get our food...much longer than expected.  But it's a fine Steakhouse, these types of things takes a while.  We enjoyed each other's company while we waited, no big deal.  We knew there was a problem though when a supervisor or manager came up to apologize for the length of the wait...that made us pay attention.  We also noticed that we hadn't seen our server for a while.  We then noticed that a different server was coming to our table to pour Wine from our bottle...I jokingly said \\\"hey you must be our new server\\\"...he had a slight grin and then went away.\\n\\nOur food finally arrived and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I had the Peppercorn Filet and after the first bite knew it wasn't for me.  There was way too much Peppercorn on it for me.  Normally, I like it but this was a bit much...my bad for ordering it instead of a regular Filet.  See the pic I posted and you'll see how much Pepper was on there.  I was hungry and it was my fault for ordering it, so I ate it.  The Fried Potatoes I ordered for the side dish was ok.\\n\\nThe Wife enjoyed her Salmon a lot.\\n\\nAfter we ate dinner, the bus person cleared our table and we sat for a while...where the heck was our server?  I think he might've went AWOL....who knows, but after a while the other server who came by earlier stopped by to check on us.  Normally, if a server goes home sick or takes a long break another server will let you know that they'll be taking care of you...but that never happened here.

{"prompt": "Sentence: Ok, I admit, I am not a sports bar person.  Heck, I am not so much of a sports person.  But I am a huge fan of wings, and thus I sought out a place that had pretty decent ones.  This led me to try Picasso's to see what it's all about.  And I have got to say, they have some pretty good ones.\\n\\nThus far, I have tried three different kinds.  The Caribbean Creepers were like eating a jerk chicken wing, but they were just a little too different for me.  The medium garlic were pretty good, but the best I have had, by far, are the Cajun Garlic.  They are the perfect level of spiciness, not too spicy but plenty of flavor.  \\n\\nI have tried some of their other things here too.  Their bacon cheese fries were kind of 'meh' when I had them; they were pretty skimpy on the cheese and bacon.  Their pizza was pretty decent.  We had the Masterpiece, had a lot of good toppings.  Still, I am not a huge fan of New York-style pizza (I originate from the Midwest, and am quite partial toward Chicago-style or deep dish), but it was pretty standard for pizza.\\n\\nService has been ok here.  I have never had bad service, so that is definitely a plus.  They do have a decent amount of seating too, and it's not overly crowded in there.\\n\\nI plan to try a few more things on their menu, and that definitely includes other styles of their wings.  Their wings are good, but I must continue on my quest for amazing wings here in Charlotte.\\n\\nOverall, I would give Picasso's about 3.5 stars.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Vacationing in Monetreal:\\nI was wandering around my hotel looking for a place to eat for dinner and saw a huge line outside this place. I decided to stand in line to see what the commotion is all about. \\n\\nInitial reaction: This place reminds me of an old school restaurant you see in movies. This place has been around for nearly 80 years. The dining area is brightly lighted and pictures and newspaper clippings covered the wall. There's even a counter for solo eaters like me to eat. I ended up talking to a guy next to me and now we're friends. According to the staff they have hooked up two couples this month! Overall a very lively experience.\\n\\nWhat I ordered: The guy next to me recommended me to try their smoked meat sandwich and get the pickle. Normally, I am really critical of sandwiches because they all taste the same to me. \\n\\nTime to order to time served: Food came out quite quickly (should've take that long since it's only a sandwich right?) even with a packed house and people waiting for a table outside. \\n\\nFood: I can see why there's a huge line outside. The sandwich itself is packed with meat and it was delicious. The fact that I was hungry made the sandwich taste even better. As stated before, I'm not much of a sandwich person and this is good. Wash it down with a soda and some fries and it's a winning formula.  \\n\\nBathroom: Didn't get to use it so I cannot comment. \\n\\nCustomer Service: The customer service was very straight forward and aggressive but still in a friendly way. I did not feel unwelcomed or rushed even though I was a bit dazed with all that commotion when I first walked in.  \\n\\nWould I eat there again: Yes, I will eat there again even though I'm not a sandwich and to me that's a pretty big deal. This place is not that cheap. For a smoked meat sandwich, fries, pickle, soda was about 13 dollars.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have stayed at the Aria, the Wynn, and the Luxor while in Vegas and would NEVER recommend anyone stay here. My fiance and I were meeting another couple in Vegas and while we were driving from Phoenix, they were flying in from Atlanta, and I wanted to limit their costs so I agreed to stay here. Based on the price, and the reputation of having the best pool in Vegas, we booked our rooms. I have NO idea how this place got best pool? Maybe back when it was built?? I booked us a Bungalow room with hopes of having a nicer than standard room and got a decent deal through their website. Self parking was free and that was about the nicest thing I could say about this place.\\n\\nThere are no doormen to help you when you arrive, not that you expect that at this level of hotel but it would have been nice given the double doors and carrying suitcases. Check-in went smoothly and we were told we could pick up our cookies from another location within the hotel. I have no idea why they wouldn't have them at the Registration desk, if only to hope you forget about picking up their free cookie...which we did.\\n\\nWalking through the casino you are engulfed by smoke. Many, if not all, of the newer properties in Vegas have a much better ventilation system to handle the smoke. This place was like something out of the 80s. The casino floor was very small and only one small area of tables. When we were at the tables or slots, we were never approached by a cocktail waitress at either. \\n\\nThe Bungalow rooms are behind a locked door that you have to use your key to access. This gave me high hopes that our room would be really nice. They were quickly squashed...not to mention you almost get knocked over if someone is leaving the Bungalow area. Watch out for those red doors! We were put on the second floor and the elevator in this area is TINY. And SLOW. We only took the elevator when arriving the first day and leaving on our last. The rest of the time we took the stairs and that's never a pleasant experience anyway.\\n\\nUpon entering our room 5234, there was a musty smell and we were startled by the extremely loud door slamming behind us. Since our door did this, it meant everyone's did this, so it made for a noisy experience as people don't catch the doors on the way in and out. The room was spacious but no mini fridge (though not the norm in Vegas) but it would have been appreciated for the two mini water bottles they provided. The bathroom was small with very limited room on the vanity. They supplied you with shampoo, conditioner and lotion...NO body wash so bring your own.  In addition, the toilet paper holder was broken and housekeeping neatly folded the toilet paper end and placed it on the back of the toilet. Classy. In addition, there was a very long, dark hair hanging off the bathroom door handle. It remained there the whole 4 days we were there. The hair dryer is also terrible so plan on bringing your own of that too. The one good thing was the shower had nice pressure and a nice tiled floor and walls.\\n\\nOur bed was comfortable but definitely basic and the pillows were comfortable. The linens were horrible though. They felt extremely cheap and thin. The room had nice artwork...and that's about the best I can compliment it. \\n\\nThe patio included in the bungalow room was nice but overlooking the pool only reminded me that I will never stay here again. The pool was ugly with cheap looking chairs, an ugly walkway and no inspiration anywhere. I still have no idea how it ever won best pool in Vegas.\\n\\nFor all the deals they provide in Vegas, spend a little extra more and stay somewhere nicer even if you aren't in your room that much.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This is apparently where Hawaiian families take their Vegas vacations.  Decent casino, won some cash at the sports book.  Older (and very well-behaved) clientele makes for a fun, quiet spot to re-group for a while.  If you've got a hankerin' for some spam give this place a shot, most of the restaurants serve some kind of Hawaiian foods.  The spam & egg sandwich from the upstairs restaurant is actually pretty good and helped me shake a pretty moderate hangover.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Oh my gosh disappointed.  I gave an extra star for service.  They aren't really lacking there.  I would frequent a BJ's in the Bay Area, excellent!   I can't eat the food here.  There is nothing good about it.  Avocado egg rolls, very bland and could use a better sauce maybe?  He ordered a steak salad took a bite then did not eat it.  The only thing half edible was the margarita pizza, which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food.  I usually order the pazookie which is my favorite.  My food was so disappointing I decided to skip the dessert to go somewhere else. When you joke around about going to the closest fast food joint after dinner... It can't be good?  Try the restaurant most adjacent that place even is better than this.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Came here for my birthday weekend. Definitely get the 1 BR suite connected ti a studio suite if your more than 4. Big complaint is that the room was very disorganized and all over the place. 3 tvs and a projector?

But overall great room the 10' projector screen is worth it!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We go for breakfast at dinner time. Never tried anything but their breakfasts.

Thanks :)\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I don't know about this place.  For the uninitiated, here's what TFT does as its business model.  \\n\\nIf a show is not sold out on a particular day, TFT asks the show box office about how many tickets they can have to sell, and the show box office sets aside tickets that they probably wouldn't sell to give to people who buy at TFT.  So, right off the bat, you know you're getting seats that are by no means the best.  Show box offices will give their worst seats, count on that, and will try to be conservative.  Let's say they have 200 open seats, think they can fill 170 on their own.  They give TFT 30 in the morning of the very worst in the house.  Later in the day, they have 100 and feel pessimistic, so they give TFT 20 more of somewhat better seats.  \\n\\nFrom the customer point of view, here are the steps:\\n\\nCons: \\n\\n1)  You must be there early.  TFT only has a limited number of tickets available per show.\\n2)  You must stand in line, from 30 minutes to an hour at the TFT booth in order buy a voucher.\\n3)  You must go as soon as you can to the box office of the show you want to attend, and get assigned a seat.  This may entail another line, maybe 30 minutes again.  This is somewhat hit-or-miss.  You may get a better (less bad) seat if you come earlier, or you may get lucky and get a better (less bad) seat if you come later.  \\n4)  You must come back to the show venue again at the time for your actual show.  \\n5)  You only get half-off for the really terrible shows that have no hope of selling out.  Top-of-the-line shows will range in savings from $10 to $30 at most, which is hardly half.\\n6)  No refunds, no exchanges, they don't care if you're dying or got hit by a truck.  Once they have your money, they don't give it back.\\n7)  Ticket Offices will assign a name to each sale, and if you lose your tickets, they'll give you an emergency set.  Lose your TFT voucher, and you're SOL, since they have no way of knowing who you are.\\n\\nPros:  \\n\\n1)  Save $10-$20.  \\n\\nShow box offices are 1000 times more flexible with refunds and cancellations, you don't have to wake up early, you only stand in line once, they'll upgrade you if they have better seats, you get to choose any seat in the house instead of just the TFT block, and they probably have better discounts already because of the economy.    \\n\\nIn my opinion, this service is a waste of time and money.  Most people make more money in an hour than they'd save for the hour of lines and hassles of TFT.  Besides, you're on vacation.  Do you really want to get up early to save a few dollars on mediocre seats?  Forget it.  \\n\\nJust a few discounts at Mystere, by Cirque du Soliel:\\n\\n1)  Senior Discount 25% off\\n2)  Student Discount 35% off\\n3)  Children 12 and under 50% off\\n4)  Military 50% off\\n5)  They have a daily hotel guest discount, from 10%, 25%, to 2-for-1\\n\\nLOVE has a daily discount for anyone, as well, and Zumanity and KA both have 1, 2, and 4 above.  Tix4Tonight is completely useless for Cirque Shows!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: So to be more specific, this review is for the Ballantyne Hotel's SPA.  I recently received a gift card for the SPA.  I chose to go with the Axiomm Gel Nail Treatment because I have gotten it done before at Polished (Shellac) and hear the Axiomm stays on longer and looks better (obviously I was pumped).\\n\\nSo making an appt was pretty easy, everyone was really sweet, my nail tech joked around with us and she was funny - and they had water with strawberries in it - who doesn't love prissy water?!  I sure as heck do.\\n\\nUnfortunately the Gel Treatment was a bust - or at least they didn't do a very good job of applying it because it started peeling and cracking two days later.  BUMMER.  \\n\\nOn the upside - I gave them a call and told them what happened and they sent me a another certificate for the full refund.... so I can't complain too much.\\n\\nMy advice?  If you want Shellac or Axxiom, go to Polished!  They do a way better job and it's cheaper.  Spend your money at the SPA on something else!\\n\\nNot a terrible experience, just a lesson.  Best of luck!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: i'm really not sure why this place got so many stars.  i've been to quite a few spas, and this one is way overpriced and the experience was mediocre.  i got the chai tea body mask treatment, which starts off with a grape seed body scrub.  you know, if i spend $210 on a treatment, don't get cheap with me on the products.  the lady had like 5 grains of sand on her hand, and was trying to exfoliate me.  i bet walking around in skinny jeans has more of an effect than this.  she tells me that it might get cold, but they can't heat the chai tea mask because it'll dry out.  so turn on the chair warmer!  i dunno if it was not an option, but i was uncomfortably cold the whole time.\\n\\nafter the scrub, she brushes on the chai tea mask, again with the stinginess.  lady, do you pocket the rest of the product and sell it on the street or something?  while she was working on my front, she folded up a towel and placed it under my head, but after being on my back for a while it started hurting my head and neck.  i'd like my $210 back, please!  she finished me off with a vanilla bean lotion, but i was so freezing cold at this point that i jumped right into the spa after the treatment was done.  brrrrrrrr!\\n\\na few minutes later my friends were done with their treatments, so we decided to check out the steam room.  it was so steamy in there that you couldn't see 2' in front of your face.  then this lady comes in and leaves the door slightly open.  she gets up to close it, but doesn't close it all the way again.  this time she's too lazy to get up and close it again, so after giving her the evil eye, i get up to close it.  she said: \\\"oops, i'm sorry.  was it not closed?\\\"  ya, right lady, like you didn't know :P  after about 15 minutes it got too hot, so we went to chill out in the arctic room, which i thought was the best part of the spa.  it looks like a cute little igloo inside, and even has \\\"snow\\\" (it's really foam) drifting down from the ceiling.  after sweating buckets in the sauna, we chilled out in the arctic room again.  i want one!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: 3 Stars just isn't high enough, but The View doesn't really deserve 4 Stars either...\\n\\nHighlights: \\nIncredibly small portions...good, but not great items in general...innovative menu items\\n\\nRefreshingly good wine selection...though most varieties start at $12/$13 a glass and go up\\n\\nExceedingly friendly/welcoming staff...It is clear that customer service is a priority here\\n\\nI'm a fan of the modish/distressed/industrial/weathered tables & d\\u00e9cor \\n\\nThe view...of what again?...a fountain?  \\n\\nEnjoyable live music!\\n\\n\\nEnjoyed a very good evening here with a group of friends.

The deserts were generous though not huge.\\n\\nNow for what really stood out. The service. Our waiter was the most helpful I've ever met in a restaurant. He gave us advice but was not just pushing the expensive items.

This may be the only one that has not converted to their newer, updated theme, like a family style pizza place. It's very 1980's in here. I totally agree with Blair B. on the decor looking like it came from \\\"Saved By The Bell\\\" set, bright colors, and geometric shapes paired with black and white print contrast. \\n\\nStill my favorite place to get a pizza at a sit-down restaurant. My favorite remains to be be the \\\"Gotham\\\"- pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. And then, to take some home, to have at another time, it's a treat. It's not as greasy as my husband's favorite, Pizza Hut. I've also had on the menu: the sandwiches (eggplant parmesan), salad (house), and the calzones (huge), too- which are all, very yummy too. What I always saw at the Trop location, was the huge pizza for takeout, I always wondered about that, I think that it's one topping, but I could be wrong.\\n\\nThis location is probably the smallest one, and so, it can fill up fast. But if you get there at the right time, your wait time (for a table and for your food) won't be so bad. Service was pretty good. The hostess was nice. But because it's a small place, there might be a wait for the restroom (single one).\\n\\nGreat pizza, good food, a trusted pizza chain restaurant.

Everything I would want in a dentist but with that being said I am very disappointed in the front desk management. Last week on Friday I received a call telling me I had a $40 balance that I had never heard of before. I told her how in June I had moved and informed them of the address but I apologized and told them I would call the following week because I was about to get on a plane and didn't want to give my card number out over the phone in front of people. Unfortunately I forgot because it was a busy week right before holidays to get as much done with clients. I received a voicemail this Friday from I believe her name is Jessica stating that I had a $40 balance and that has been over 90 days so I was being sent to collections. I have an appointment there in early January. If they had my number they should have called well before now. Not the week of telling me I have until 2pm to pay. I have 2 phones and my personal is not the one I always have right by me and so I missed her call and because I constantly travel for work I didn't get her message until after 5. To be sent to collections for a stupid $40 balance that I have only just now heard of and not given ample time to pay infuriates me. I have never missed any payments whatsoever. Needless to say as soon as Monday morning comes I will be paying the stupid $40 balance and canceling all future appointments. $40 are you kidding me! If you had my number you should have called sooner. Shouldn't be sent to collections because I moved and you didn't update the data correctly. I have a follow up appointment in January I could have paid you in person then. If you are going to use Southview I would recommend never moving and always calling them to see if you have a balance. Lord knows they don't call you until after 90 days.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Had the frozen hot chocolate and I guess I'm going to have to agree with the other reviewers in that it's nothing too great to rave over.

There, I said it. Not because I thought it would be awful. But just... I admit, I judged a book by its cover.  And I didn't avoid it, but just always went somewhere else instead.

But I tasted my friends, and they're good (shh, it's not cheating, I didn't buy my own drink ok?!) The raspberry mojito, yum. The margarita, yum. I don't need to say much else. THe cocktails win.\\n\\nThe music. Oh yes. They had a guest DJ on decks. None of your pop chart pish. None of your R n' B pish. None of your weird dub drum n' step bass that doesn't gel with a margarita. Instead, world afro-salsa-samba beats that had me wanting to DANCE. We even tried but there wasn't enough room.\\n\\nA really cool crowd too. Some students, some like myself not but still young professionals. Not such a dressy bar either. Jeans would be appropriate, as would ending up here at 5pm on a Friday night after work (whther it's an office or a coffee shop) and staying till close.\\n\\nThere aren't lots of seats downstairs, a few tall tables up the back and it was crowded on a Saturday night. But there's more seating upstairs (an area had been reserved). But as with any good cocktail bar, if you want to get a seat, get there early. To me, that's a sign that it's good.\\n\\nI'm not quite sure if I've made my point yet. I LOVE IT HERE. If you take me here, I'm yours.

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich only to be told a few minutes later that they couldn't make those on the weekends? So I ordered the chicken fried chicken dinner. Yuck.

I did not feel unwelcomed or rushed even I was a bit dazed with all that commotion I first walked in.  \\n\\nWould I eat again: Yes I again even I'm a sandwich and to me thats a pretty big deal. This place is not that cheap. For a smoked sandwich, fries, pickle, soda was about 13.\nSentiment: great\n\n: This is apparently where Hawaiian families take their Vegas.  Decent casino, won some cash at the sports book.  Older (and very well-) clientele makes a fun, quiet spot to-group for a.   you' got a hankerin' for some spam give a shot, most the restaurants serve some of Hawaiian.  The spam & egg sandwich from the upstairs restaurant is actually good and me shake a pretty moderate.\nSentiment: good\n\n: Oh my gosh disappointed.  I gave an extra star for service.  Theyt really lacking there.  I would frequent a BJ's in the Bay Area, excellent!   I can't eat food here.  There is nothing good about it.  Avocado egg rolls, very bland and could use a better sauce maybe?  He a steak salad bite then did not it.  The thing half edible the margarita pizza, which was super small even. It is not even fun to hang out in there. There is just no flavor in the food.  I usually order the pazookie is favorite.  My food was so I decided to skip the dessert to go else. When you joke around about going to the closest food joint after dinner... It can' be good?  Try the restaurant most adjacent that place even is than this.\n: bad\n\n: Came here for my birthday weekend. Definitely get the 1 BR suite connected ti a studio suite if your more than 4. Big complaint is that the room was very disorganized and all. 3 tvs and a projector? Sounds nice but kinda overkill. I would rather have it be more quality than. But overall great room the 10' projector screen is worth it!\n: neutral\n\n: We go for breakfast at dinner time. Never tried anything but their breakfasts. They are friendly- helpful. I go with 3 friends in wheelchairs and they handle us, problem.\\n  The breakfast that we order- are huge and delish. We go once a month and will always. Thanks :)\n: great\n\n: So to be more specific, this is for the Ballantyne Hotels SPA.  I recently received gift card for the SPA.  I chose to go with the Axiomm Gel Nail Treatment because I have gotten it done before at Polished (Shel) and hear themm stays on longer and looks better (obviously I was pumped).\\n\\nSo making an appt was easy, everyone was really sweet, my nail tech joked around with us and she was funny - and they had water with strawberries in it - who't love prissy water?!  I sure as heck do.\\n\\nUnfortunately the Gel Treatment was a bust - or least theyt do a job of applying it because it started peeling and cracking two days later.  BUMMER.  \\n\\nOn the upside - I gave a and them what happened and they me a another certificate for the full refund.... so I can't complain much.\\n\\nMy advice?   you want Shellac or Axxiom, go to Polished!  They do a job and its cheaper.  Spend money at the SPA on else!\\n\\nNot a terrible experience, a lesson.  Best luck!\nSentiment: good\n\n: 3 Stars justt enough but The Viewt really deserve  Stars either...\\n\\nHighlights:nIncredibly small portions...good, but not great items in...innovative menu items\\n\\nRefreshingly good wine...though most varieties start at $1213 a glass and go up\\n\\nExceedingly friendly/welcoming...It is that is a priority here\\nnIm a of the modish/distressed/industrial/weathered tables & d\\u00e9cornnThe view...of what again?...a fountain?  n\\nEnjoyable live music!\\n\\n\\nEnjoyed a very good evening here with a of friends.   was immediately that the management here cares about the customer.

This the only one that has not converted to their newer, updated theme, like a family pizza place. It's very 190s in here. I totally with Blair B. on the decor looking like it came from \\\"Saved By The Bell\\\" set, bright colors, and geometric shapes with black white print. \\n\\nStill favorite place to get a pizza at a sitdown. My favorite remains to be be the \\\"Gotham\\\"- pepperoni, sausage, ground beef,, green, and. And then, to take some home, to have at another time, it's a treat.'s not as as mys, Pizza Hut. I've also had on the menu: the sandwiches (eggplant parmesan), salad (house), and the cal (huge), too- which all, very yummy. What I always saw at the Trop location, the huge pizza for takeout, I always wondered about that, I think that it's one topping, but I could wrong.\\n\\nThis is probably the smallest one, and so, it can fill up. But you get there at the, your wait time (for a table and for your) be so. Service was. The was nice. But because its a, there might be wait for the restroom (single one).\\nnGreat pizza, good, a trusted pizza chain restaurant. is a why I've loved the Gotham pizza so years.\n good\n\n: Had the frozen hot chocolate and I I'm to have to agree the other reviewers in that its nothing too great to rave.  It does taste like a cold chocolate.  't amazed well, only amazed the.  Overpriced but least my wife.  I must be something.\n: neutral\n\n: Its Friday' a taste for. But as it not even midday Ive to have I'll quench thirst by reliving a recent, very, evening in Dragonfly.\\nnI can't believe I actively avoided this bar. There I said it. Not I it be awful. But just... I admit, I judged a book.   It avoid it, but just always went else. I thought a cocktail bar the Grassmarket, where theret many others of its, be a tad...odd? Despite that Emily V, Anna, Catriona, Luke D...gosh countless other yelpers had given it their 3, 45 star ratings and up.\\n\\nHow I glad that Rachael, Morven and Val took me here of Bond No 9 (well, in fact before a taxi trip to9 but I).nnI.

I LOVE IT. you take me I'm. least until the margaritas.\n: great\n\n: I guess my family I came on a night: as we been there dozens times before and considered ourselves \\\"regulars.\\\".  Slow, one steak was, waitresst come by to check on us until we were.   These things happen in the restaurant business...I understand that.  The that when I told the waitress the one partially-eaten $18 steak was she went the manager who sent back a coupon a of pie, which I was.  No apology from either the manager...who even come over.    I stuck the pie coupon in my left-over mashed potatoes and we all stormed off!  I'd give them another chance but my wifet...end of an era for.  BTW I sent a friendly \\\"these things can email, but no one bothered to get back.\n: terrible\n\n: Def. the best buffet in Vegas imo.\\nnMy are: creme bru, roast turkey (so!), pork with cole slaw on, breakfast food (ie their ome), botto mimos and the that were to stay from lunch dinnernnThe only con I had this time that our was quite in. She bring of our drinks on but nonetheless, food.\\nnBe prepared to your face silly!\n good\n\n: Went there for lunch a. Was a menu saying here are our lunch specials. We then try to order from the menu and they say that menu side we ordered from is only for the weekday but it wasn't even mentioned in person or on the menu itself. So we order the 'specials' anyway for regular price because it took long enough to have the waitress take our order in the first place. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich only to be told a few minutes later that they couldn't make those on the weekends? So I ordered the chicken fried chicken dinner. Yuck. The chicken was too well done, the corn was soggy and the potatoes had a weird taste probably due to the gravy.

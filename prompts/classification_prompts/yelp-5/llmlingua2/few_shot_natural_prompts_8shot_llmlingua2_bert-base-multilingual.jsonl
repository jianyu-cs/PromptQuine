Plenty of meat, it can be overwhelming at times.  I cannot believe I ate so much steak that once I went back to my Hotel room I fell into a meat coma.

Good thing I was in Vegas and every night is a party night.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Do not think all Port of Subs are alike.  This location is AWFUL.  We've had bad service more than once.  We won't go back after the second time.  The bad service was unbelievable.  They actually argued with my co-worker over what she wanted on her sandwich and got really testy.  Just absolute jerks, I can't say it enough.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This branch is a hit or miss when it comes to customer service. There are some cases where the employees have been short with me and then there are some occasions where they bend over backwards. Overall, they are pleasant enough and get me in and out in a timely manner. \\n\\nThey are reasonable with the speed in which they turn people. It is busy for being such a small branch. There is always a line, but the wait is not that long.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I've never been a fan of this place and I'm still now.  My dad enjoys this place and found several things on the menu that he was interested in.  We shared a calamari which was good, and I ordered their korean chicken pizza.  I took 1 bite and didn't like it at all.  To be honest it's not that it was made wrong or anything like that, I just didn't care for it.  The server was nice and took it away and the manager stopped by to inquire and I simply told her I just didn't care for it and it was removed from the check.   Lunch was completely dead in here and it didn't surprise me. \\n\\nI also found it dis respectful (since I'm a restaurant manager myself) to have a server LOUDLY say in the middle of an empty dining room \\\"I can't take that table\\\"\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I decided I would like all my dining to be done at the bar of old renovated homes in downtown Phoenix.  Lucky me, I found Coronado Cafe.\\nWe stopped in for lunch so I did not order as much food as I normally like to when trying out a new restaurant ( it was a work day ).  Unfortunately, I will only be reviewing on item.  I'll make it up to you; I promise.\\nWe went during lunch and there was a wait for a table for two, so we sat at the bar.  The place is pretty small.  The bar was big enough for four people, five tops.  There was a nice selection of spirits and wine that I could see but not drink.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and chose the potato salad over the baked beans.  It was deliciously moist and the chiles had the right amount of heat.  The potato salad was very tasty satisfying side.\\nIt was a simple, satisfying lunch.  I would like to come back another time when they aren't as busy.  It was hard to get a server/bartender's attention and there's some cozy seating outside that's too hot to use at lunch in August.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We had lunch here last week and had a great experience.\\nWe ordered the meat pierogi, potato & chz pierogi, and gr. beef cutlet.

The puppies were adorable, and we played with several of them and I chose one. I had not intended on purchasing a puppy that day but I thought, what the heck, we always wanted one.\\nThe prices were really high, and we came back the next day to return and they still said I have to pay 40% for a dog I no longer had? They over load you with paperwork and crap and you do not get to process everything, especially with an adorable puppy in your arms. Not only that, but our dog was REALLY sick in the afternoon the next day. Why would they sell me a sick dog for 3000?\\n\\nOverall a terrible experience, I would not recommend anyone going there. Purchase straight from a breeder for the rarer breeds to avoid the third party costs.\\n\\nAnd not just that, everything is expensive including the \\\"free\\\" starter kit they used.\\n\\nAWFUL\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This place was awesome! Such a fun idea. It was quite busy, but it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted anyway, and it was interesting to watch them making other people's ice cream while we waited. I had the coconut milk chai ice cream with salted caramel... it was just OK, the caramel was too burnt-tasting for my taste. But the mint ice cream (with regular milk) and the banana (with almond milk) were really terrific. I think if they used a fuller fat coconut milk it would make a richer, more satisfying ice cream (and still gluten-free and non-cow). Overall, definitely worth the trip and I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I lived close to this place....

I guess I was just expecting better.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I decided to come here during our Vegas stay through a program recommendation, and we thought it would be a great way to spend a few hours going through this.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I had a great time going through this experience, simply because it was something we always wanted to do. The instructors were well versed in laying out all the instructions so that our group knew what to do. \\n\\nTIP: Use the Yelp and foursquare promo deals so that you can save on your flight and your DVD of your flight experience (if you choose to get one)\\n\\nThe great thing is that the instructor will guide you and take you through it so that you won't have to feel nervous at all.\\n\\nTrust me, by the end of the day, you're going to feel very sore from all the intense wind tunnel velocity shooting through your body. \\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend that you try it and see how much fun it can be!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The Phoenix airport experience is horrendous. This is my second time this year and likely my last. Understaffed, one person checking in cars at 6:30am, aloof indifferent staff. Awful. I get stressed each time I rent there. I won't put up with it anymore.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Came here for lunch with bottomless champagne for about $30. I was pretty satisfied. This buffet is separated by countries (they actuall have signs that say Asian/Italian/American...etc.). All in all, each type of food is well represented. The chinese food was good, not just your typical Panda Express type. Good pizza. They had Kobe beef sliders!!! Kobe beef! Prime rib was pretty good, tender and pink. Also, the dessert selection is fairly large. The waitress was super nice, loading us up on bubbly as soon as our glasses were empty. Only complaint is that seafood selection could've been better. I would definitely recommend this buffet.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: 1. They don't serve freshly squeezed orange juice. \\n\\n2. They don't serve fresh fruit. (only fruit cocktail out of a  can) \\n\\n3. They don't serve real Jam. \\n\\nIf you serve breakfast, and do not meet at least one  the criteria listed above, then your establishment belongs in the same echelon as Dennys. \\n\\nWhy this place has 4 stars and 630 reviews is beyond me. I question if I even at at the right restaurant? \\n\\nDuring our wait, the host gave us a 5 minute speech on how \\\"the owner buys only the freshest items for the menu\\\". - Fresh like a can of fruit cocktail. \\n\\nThe interior looks like a blue screen studio from Universal Pictures. \\n\\nI had steak and eggs. Steak was gray. Eggs were.... Eggs,  and... Nothing else to report. \\n\\nThey should call this place Mr. Meh... \\n\\nTotally standard stuff here. Not the 5 star type of standard. The 2 star type of standard. \\n\\nNext time ill spare the 45 minute wait and go to Mimi's Cafe, at least they have fresh squeezed OJ, fresh fruit, muffins baked that the same morning, and decent breakfast...\\n\\nSorry to kill the buzz here, but I am sure Mr. Mommy (if he even cares to read yelp) would appreciate some constructive and much needed feedback amongst the hoards of shallow praise. \\n\\nGo get some oranges.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: my friends could not stop raving about the lobster enchiladas from this place while we were in vegas, so we HAD to go. \\n\\nI really liked the chips. I guess they are a blend of flour and corn so they had a different texture than ordinary tortilla chips. Very crisp!\\n\\nunfortunately, i wasnt too impressed by the enchiladas. they didnt exactly blow my mind. i liked the sauce more than the food itself.  However, it was really sweet. I enjoyed it more as a dip for the chips.  \\n\\nThe service was great. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. \\n\\nmaybe i just wasnt in the mood, so the food seemed mediocre.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I decided to try this place after reading they reviews. One of the best manicures I've ever had! Jen was so thorough and meticulous- my feet feel so pampered and soft! And the salon is beautiful. Definitely A five star place!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: My appointment was for glasses.  I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\\n\\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \\n\\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\\n\\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\\n\\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.  This experience has been so horrendous and I hate my glasses so much that I am seriously considering lasik surgery so that I never have to wear glasses again or have to deal with the hassle of getting cheated on a pair of glasses in the future.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I've heard that this is one of the most amazing Thai restaurants to ever exist, but I don't think I'm enough of a Thai connoisseur to support that claim. The food was very good, but I didn't walk out of there feeling blown away.\\n\\nWe shared a rice dish (nam kao tod) which I loved. Have not had anything like that before. A little tangy, little spicy. Maybe it was my own fault for ordering musman curry (too pedestrian?) but I've had better. It was good, but too sweet. My fianc\\u00e9 ordered a noodle dish which was too spicy for me so I can't really rate that.\\n\\nI don't think I would personally go out of my way to go to LOS, but I would go if someone else wanted to.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I was disappointed in the show because about 15 minutes into the show, I realized I was not watching the original members. And what tipped me off was the 6'-2\\\" tall, 220 lb dude in a mask. If you are a die hard fan, you can tell by the movements that they weren't the members you saw on television. The show I watched was pretty much watching the equivalent of a cover band playing your favorite band's music. It was still good, it just wasn't what I thought I was paying for. I did complain to Monte Carlo to try to get my money back and this was their response:\\n\\n\\\"All performers are indeed Jabbawockeez, in every performance. They have expanded their crew and on any given performance, they rotate.\\\"\\n\\nI know some of the dancers are Super Crew members during the b-boy numbers, but you can tell that the routines for the original members were filled in by other dancers. They did do a decent job though, but I still would not buy another ticket to see them perform. I would pay to watch them again if I knew for sure it was going to be the original members. My 2 star rating would be bumped up to 4 stars if that was the case.\\n\\nOther than that, the show is about 2 hours long and more than half of that is filled with comedic mime skits and audience participation numbers. Totally understandable because it would be hard to fill two solid hours of dancing routines. The dance routines were well done. If you have seen all their you-tube videos, you have seen all their dance numbers in the show.\\n\\n2 Stars... JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Mehh...A-OK. I've been here multiple times for the past several years, and I'm not sure why..The pho is alright, don't like the taste as much as some other places I've tried. The service is not good, and the prices are higher than most. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself looks pretty nice and clean, and parking is always convenient. There's never too many people when I go, but the food is just alright..\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: The food is fresh and vibrant. The service is friendly and everything you want from a local breakfast/lunch spot.\\n\\nI had the ultimate club with fries. It was delicious. If you a haven't been you need to come by and try Bite.\\n\\nWe will be back.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The below is just one person's experience and from the looks of the avg diner, it seems like it's a restaurant worth trying.  \\n\\nVegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Le Cirque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobster bisque was way way too salty.  The risotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall off the bone.  The halibut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that was soggy and not what was intended in terms of texture context between the flesh and the breading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of a souffle is to break it yourself and pour in the cream/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking.  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is supposed to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made out of ice, but the taste was too tart and didn't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative. The money would have been better spent else where I'm afraid.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Story of a Wood Fired Chicken\\n\\nOnce upon a warm, sunny March day, two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita. The two monkeys were under the impression that this jungle only offered pita dishes, a notion that was quickly proved to be a myth as each monkey ordered a wrap of sorts. As the two monkeys regretfully chowed down on their mediocre wraps, each caught a glimpse of a most uplifting . . . chicken. Yes, a chicken. A wonderfully massive Wood Fired Chicken, mounted upon a bed of mashed potatoes, floating by to another monkey's tree. Mouths sputtering water, the monkeys finished their meal and agreed to help themselves to this attractive chicken next time.\\n\\nOnce upon another warm, sunny March day, the same two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita and each ordered a fine-looking Wood Fired Chicken. Anticipation knocked on their trees as they waited. Finally, the stunning chicken arrived. The monkeys ravaged each bite of their outstanding meal, which contained a blend of seasoned spinach, mashed potatoes, and juicy chicken - all soaked in a citrusy tomato sauce. Oh glorious day, that day they reveled in the glorious Wood Fired Chicken. Even though the portion was huge, each monkey licked their plate clean and swore they would return again for the Wood Fired Chicken, because that's where it's at in the Jungle of Pita.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Came to this casino since it is attached to the Mandalay Bay. Pretty decent opportunities to gamble with friendly dealers and reasonable table limits. Everything seemed a bit dingy and the random unenthusiastic dancers near the table games was awkward. The free drinks here were really strong and were difficult to drink. One of the few places that actually would refuse drink service to patrons who were not actually gambling (e.g. sitting with someone gambling).\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Its not bad pho, its just not great pho.  When I wrote my first review I was a rookie and didn't have anything to compare it too.  Now that my pho palate has some notches in its belt I can say that this isn't the real deal.\\n\\nMaybe I was here on an off day, but the broth just didn't have that depth and complexity as compared to Ben Thanh or Vietnam Grille.  Thats really about the extent of my review.  The ambiance is nice and I'd say if you are in the area its worth visiting, but other than that, there are other places worth the journey.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I hosted a pre-chemotherapy get together at Saddle Ranch Chop House for a girlfriend of mine that's facing down breast cancer last night and I was NOTHING but impressed with the level of service from everyone, the quality of the food, and professionalism from our server, Teresa.

Good work, guys!  \\n\\nSaddle Ranch took care of every detail for us and was very attentive to our needs last night; making sure that our table was set up and decorated with balloons before we arrived, to surprising our whole table (adults only) with a round of pink lemonade vodka shots and two towers of pink cotton candy for our table!  \\n\\nReally I could not be more pleased with them and wanted to thank them personally on Yelp for the excellent service at my friend's very important night out last night.  \\n\\nThank you guys for making my friend's night special!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have given this restaurant FOUR tries and they have failed every time.  Today was the last time I even attempt to patronize their restaurant.  Their food is not that good, and their service is ABYSMAL.\\n\\nWe arrived shortly after they opened for lunch.  There was a single party of five in the restaurant.  While we waited for even a drink order to be taken, the other party was served by all three people working (couldn't spare one for us?), AND another party came in and got their order taken.\\n\\nRepeatedly they walked by us, and ignored us.  We waited 10 minutes then left.  Each of my four experiences there have been like this.  I will never return.  I really hope the owners read this.  They were there today and completely ignored us.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Enjoyed dinner here for the first time since the opening, and YUM. \\n\\nThe restaurant seemed to be pretty crowded, but the host did a fantastic job of traffic control and really had people moving in quickly as tables were vacated. Our server was quick and friendly, and my seasonal draft beer (Penn Brewery Chocolate Stout) was fantastic. \\n\\nPartner and I split the tasty classic poutine, and then each had sandwiches (me: Southwest veggie burger, him: chicken sandwich). Both were good, but not as good as the poutine. \\n\\nMy advice: get here early or late on the weekends, because the place isn't huge (though bigger than its sibling, Point Brugge) and I don't think they take reservations. The waiting area is pretty small (and right in front of the door), which led to some folks waiting in the vestibule. The bar area is sort of cramped and busy, meaning that if you can't grab a barstool, you're likely to be blocking traffic and moving out of the way quite a bit.  \\n\\nTry the poutine and the beers on tap.

I am very, very particular about my pepperoni pizzas. The crust must be thin and crispy. The sauce not too thick or too thin and the pepperoni flavorful. I like my pepperoni pizzas cooked well done. A little black on the crust is totally acceptable and preferred.

Not only is the owner a complete snob, but the equipment is filthy and unsanitary. \\n\\nI was appalled by the snooty attitude of the owner - despite there being no one else in the salon, she acted like she was doing me a favor by \\\"squeezing me in\\\" without an appointment. She talked down to me the entire time and kept glaring at me while I nursed my infant daughter. Not one other person came in the whole time I was there.\\n\\nThe pedicure footbath was obviously filthy when I sat down - with flakes of old skin everywhere and scum. She made a big show of scrubbing the tub before starting, but I should have left then and there because I developed a fungal nail infection within a few weeks of the visit.\\n\\nThe cost was exorbitant for a mediocre pedicure and I've spent nearly as much treating the infection to boot.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Very good beer.

When Dr.Kempf came in he just told me the price and that they would have to put her to sleep. I asked about any other cost of medication and he just told me it would be $10 extra.\\nI got the bill and it was $30 extra, and well I was just prepared to pay about $100. It seemed like they just did the procedure and just told me the price, I didn't really get any details on what was going on.\\nI'm not entirely sure if they're good or not, I mean they didn't really know how to handle picking up my bunny or even know information about the care of bunnies.\\nIn the end, I wouldn't come back because it makes me feel as if my pets are not in the right hands.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: My favorite thing about this comic store is the fact that they just about always have a copy of something I'm looking for.

{"prompt": "Sentence: I sometimes stop at this Smith's when I'm in the general area.  I find this to be one of the best stocked stores that Smith's has in the area.  The staff is generally very competent.\\n\\nI went here today for some quick pick up of items, and I ended up getting more than I planned because they are now stocking a kind of cheese I love.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Time to pick up some cool Tactical project\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: As usual, great steaks.  I had a large ribeye that I couldn't finish.  My wife had a filet.  Both were good cuts.  The view is from the 4th floor overlooking the strip.  Nice to see the crowds and not hear or be in the middle of them at the same time!   Great place at 4-5 in the afternoon to eat supper before a show that night.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I was thoroughly disappointed with this place. For starters, the night we went (about 2 months ago) there was a $12 cover per person and there wasn't even any live music or entertainment. I still don't know what the cover was for... The bar was filthy and totally outdated, the staff were not friendly and the overall vibe was blah. \\n\\nWe arrived and ordered a round of drinks. As we were sitting outside on the patio, one of the bar staff came up to our table to clear our empty drinks and mistakenly took a drink that was half full. I said something to him and about 5 minutes later the \\\"bar manager\\\" came out and asked us all to leave. We were upset and confused. Once we were outside she told us that she thought we were on \\\"high on drugs\\\" (which we weren't) and said we are not welcome back for the night. I called the next day and left a message for the owner and never got a call back to this day. Highly, highly embarrassed and disappointed. \\n\\nWe went back about two weeks ago and decided to give it another shot and we still were not impressed at all. I would absolutely NOT recommend going here. Save your money or go to one of the other 65 bars in the area. That's my story...\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Cheap pizza.  If you're lucky, you'll get what you paid for.  I'm feeling kind and giving this location two stars.  They rarely cover the pizza in cheese and toppings, but remember that the cheese and pepperoni pizzas are just $5.  When we have ordered the supreme ($8) the toppings are either burnt or look as though they have seen a few better days.  If you order the Supreme and they tell you it will be 5 minutes, be prepared to wait anywhere between 15-20.  \\n\\nBottom line, if you're looking for a little more quality, try Papa John's, Domino's or Pizza Hut and pay a few dollars more.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We walked here from the last monorail stop in 112 degree heat because I thought it was going to be that good, it wasn't.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: A+ for service at Karben4.  It was a March madness Saturday, and this was our first stop on a short circuit of Madison breweries.  At about 11:15am, we were their first customers through the door.  The bartender was incredibly friendly and it made a big difference to make us feel welcome in a bar that was just opening for the day.  Even though the place was empty for the first 15 minutes or so that we were there, she was in a good mood and happy to give us some information about the operation without being overbearing.  \\n\\nEvery type of beer they served was solid.  The Deep Winter Stout, Fantasy Factory IPA and Nightcall Porter were all standouts on the flight we ordered.  The feel of the bar area is minimalist, modern, unpretentious, spacious and could double as a Tom Selleck shrine.  We never got around to asking about the artwork.  We also didn't order any food, but I was impressed enough with the place to make it a meal destination the next time I'm in town.  If you're in Madison and you want to check out the local brewing scene, Karben4 should be near the top of your list.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Talk about a woman who knows the meaning of the word boudoir. Jodi is excellent at what she does. Having \\\"sexy\\\" photos taken is not an easy thing for most women, and for some of us, it just doesn't come naturally. Jodi has a way of making you feel comfortable in your own skin and sexy. Before you know it, the photo shoot is over and she has captured some incredible photos that you didn't even think you were capable of taking.  The experience  for me was priceless! Jodi and her staff made me feel like a girly girl, pretty, sexy and confident. Pictures may fade in time, but that experience I will have for a life time. Thank you so much!\\n We love our photo book and could not be more pleased with the entire experience. Jodi is an amazing photographer and artist, as well as reliable and efficient. Highly recommend!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Overpriced Chinese food with little to no spices. 12$ for 4 steam dumplings that tasted bleh.   Great atmosphere ok customer service but out of three dishes ordered none was good. Total disappointment. The asian food was better at planet hollywoods buffet. Big disappointment. Wont be back.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Went here for late lunch one Saturday with a friend and i was decidedly underwhelmed. The Cozumel Burrito looked very promising, but was pretty \\\"meh\\\" when I got it. It was OK, but the sauce was a little ketchupy. My friend was reasonably satisfied with whatever it was he ordered, but neither of us was blown away.\\n\\nThe biggest gripe I had with this place was the service! We'd just come from a 20 mile bike ride on a hot day, and although I'd been guzzling down and refilling my water constantly, I was perpetually thirsty. I left my water bottle outside on my bike assuming I could get a nice cold glass of water on entering. I literally asked our waiter for water at least 3 times before we got it, including once getting up and walking across the restaurant to the bar. When he finally brought us water, he was not in the least bit apologetic for the delay. Were they busy I'dve been more understanding, but as I said this was post lunch-time rush and there weren't a lot of other tables. This was, however, during the world cup, so maybe the football was decidedly more important than his customers.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Had High Expectations that barely were met. \\n\\nThe word gastropub is becoming dirty in Las Vegas.  Culinary Dropout gave me a perspective on how to abuse this title.  Not a HUGE (Cheesecake Factory/Grand Luxe-esque) but Vegas appropriately broad selection of dishes.  \\n\\nThe space that restaurant consumes makes it feel like a hanger with a dynamic inside-outside transition that shows off the beauty of the HRH pools.\\n\\nThat's where everything went downhill...\\n\\nThe service was Vegas nice, the music was Hard Rock music and despite GnR beginning their residency, I was expecting a larger rush at the CD.  \\n\\nThe antipasti which we ordered came approximately 3.5 minutes to my buddy and mine's entrees being served.  All of which were at room temperature...no bueno.\\n\\nNo bueno on a few folds...cured meats at room temperature are very strange (to me) at room temperature.  Add a bistro steak ordered Medium Rare, SERVED Rare, and at room temperature is also distressing, the only reason I didn't send it back was the flavors from the gastrique and Gorgonzola and my supreme hunger level at that time.\\n\\nMy buddy had mixed views of his Pork Cubano.\\n\\nThere were highs and lows, but right now plans for a return visit.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I'm not a buffet person but when it's complimentary why not? I ate here twice once for lunch and once for BF.  What a decent spread for brunch during the week! \\n\\nStarted off with a Bloody Mary which was included on the brunch. Some of the items in the buffet - Korean short ribs, Dim Sum, Sushi, slab bacon, shrimp cocktails, mac and cheese, Ham, turkey, fried chicken, cooked to order omelets, pizza, salads and yummy Tri Tip just to name a few. My favs in the dessert area the peanut butter cookie and Gelato. \\n\\nI did like the idea of the specialty items are in small portions which is a good thing. The waiter we had was friendly and really accommodating.\\n\\nOnly con here I felt was that the brunch buffet should open earlier for the working people like myself. Hours are from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm Monday - Friday.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I go here almost weekly for lunch with co-workers. It's everything you want in a Mexican restaurant: bottomless fresh chips and salsa before your food comes, enormous portions of delicious Mexican dishes, and a very attentive and polite staff. I've tried every lunch special on the menu and they will all leave you satisfies and ready for a siesta.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: had breakfast there. thought it was better than sitting in dusk inside. terrible eggs, artificial orange juice. expensive\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Nope, nope, nope.\\n\\nI came here on the recommendation of other fellow Yelpers and I am so disappointed.\\n\\nFirstly, parking is a mess.  Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.\\n\\nSo the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.\\n\\nSo my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.\\n\\nI had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said \\\"Yes, she'll have another!\\\" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??\\n\\nSo to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  \\n\\nNever again.\\n\\nThe two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT'S IT.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: the pho was good, but not great.\\n\\ni got the meatball pho just because you don't see that everyday, and the meatballs and broth were excellent.\\n\\nthe problem i had was with the noodles. they use thin clear noodles that break apart when you go at them with the chopsticks. if they switched up the noodles to something thicker, the pho would be right on with amazing pho i have had in nyc.\\n\\nthe service could have also been better - not because of the language barrier, but in attentiveness.\\n\\nso good not great - but will go back.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We went here for Valentine's Day. \\n\\nThanks to OpenTable, we were immediately seated upon arrival. I love that OT is finally a respected reservation system at almost every fine-dining restaurant now. I've been an OT member since 2006 and believe me, it wasn't always this easy. Gone are the days of sifting through their restaurant lists realizing the place you want is not available and you'll have to call only to be placed on hold for an obscene amount of time, and you decide to leave a message only to never receive a call back confirming your request. Yay for self-service technology! Moving on...\\n\\nAs many of you know, Mr. Burke has an obsession with eggs. I didn't see it in the dinner menu, but more so in the d\\u00e9cor. Think obscure paintings and sculptures of Humpty Dumpty-like dudes everywhere. I'm not into eggs, but these were kinda cute, so I didn't mind. What I did mind were the two tops--seating was too close for comfort. We could hear the conversations next to us, which was more of a distraction than we wanted on our special night.\\n\\nAnother thing that irked me was immediately after taking our orders, our waitress declared, \\\"Just so you know, we're REALLY busy tonight, so there will be a longer wait than usual.\\\" \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had different reactions to the comment: He appreciated the head's up, while I didn't understand why she needed to tell us right then and there. You're a celebrity chef restaurant in a popular Vegas hotel--of course you're busy! I don't care if the kitchen is on fire; always make your guests feel at ease. \\n\\nNevertheless, their Blueberry Thrill martini was surprisingly refreshing and their homemade dinner roll was mouth-watering. The roll comes in individual pans that arrive straight from the oven and on to your plate. For our main courses, I ordered the Seared Salmon and he ordered the Dry-Aged Bone-In New York Strip. Both entrees delivered exactly what we expected--appetizing, generously portioned, and seasoned well. No wow-factor, though. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were amazing. If I can recommend only one thing on their menu, make sure you order the truffle fries!! We were too stuffed for dessert.\\n\\nAnd after all that, there wasn't even a \\\"longer wait than usual\\\" for anything we ordered!  \\n\\nGreat food, so-so service: 3.5, but I'm feeling nice today so I'll round up.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: A friend introduced me to this place a couple of weeks ago. Excellent atmosphere! It's an art gallery with a coffee shop embedded in it. The bakery is awesome, and I had a great soup and sandwich lunch, too. Super easy access to and from I-94 Eastbound. What really sets this place apart is the friendly staff - they really make you feel welcome and important, without being over the top perky. I'll be back - A LOT!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Bad service and even worse \\\"food.\\\"  I'll never go back while in the area.  I'd rather eat McDonald's or at some other fast food place - they offer about the same number of \\\"healthy\\\" options. \\n\\nThey get 1 star because of all the adorable old people there.  Other than a hospital/old folks' home - I've never seen so many walkers and oxygen tanks in one place!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to gather a few friends to try out this so called hidden gem.  I have to say we were greatly disappointed!  We ordered the highly suggested Beef Roll and received what seemed to be a cold, Mexican burrito.  It was dry and tasteless.  We also ordered the steamed juicy buns, which were no more than pork dumplings.  The rest of the meal consisted of Walnut Shrimp, Tofu with Black Bean Sauce and Veggie Chow Mein.  They were ok...nothing that lived up to the great reviews.  The service wasn't much to brag about either.  The entrees came out sporadically and we weren't hungry by the time the last item arrived.  Also, the waiter was hard to track down and we had to follow up a few times for items we requested.  Our overall experience was lackluster and I have to give it the thumbs down!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: You park at the bottom. You pay at the bottom. You ride to the top. You come back down.\\n\\nI honestly believe $4 roundtrip is too much. The ideal situation would be $2 roundtrip and a free hot dog. I'd go everyday.\\n\\nGoing up, I was scared for my life. The car seemed hesitant especially at the top drop off point. I must admit that the highlight was taking pictures. It was too cold to walk around, but I may take advantage of this site in the summer with or without the hot dog deal. (I hope with.)\\n\\nOn the way down, the car was jam-packed and so very awkward. We saw a proposal occurring in the opposite car, which caused a couple to bicker. Now that's true romance.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This place has the cutest clothes! Always on trend and great pricing. The only complaint about this location is its organization, it needs to be layed out better!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Great service. As soon as you walk in the door they greet you with a great smile and are really nice. Then when you order they bring you a complimentary small seafood pancake which was nice and crispy. Then when the came out the portion was so big we ordered the tonkatsu plate. It seemed like they put three portions on one!!! I love the variety of different tofu soup we for the seafood one. It had great chunks of mussels, shrimp and scallops that hit the spot. Also just like every other Korean restaurant they bring 5 side dishes with refills!! Definitely will go again and great price for two entree we spent $24 and of course we had a lot of left overs to take home!!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Overall nice atmosphere (very blue!), However wait time for drinks is lousy.  I feel eventually people will get tired of paying the cover and spend their money elsewhere once the newness of Cathode wears off.  Also, the drinks are way over priced.  I ordered 2 drinks and my bill was over $24.  When looking at the receipt, I was charged $6 for 2 cans of red bull, however the drinks themselves require about one-third of a can.  Lastly, guard your drinks.  This was my second trip to Cathode and the second time I had more than half of my drink still in the glass when a bar-hand walked by and threw it away!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: WARNING! JUDGMENTAL BARISTA RANT!! \\n\\nWow, these baristas need some training. I ordered a 16oz Iced Latte. Nothing too difficult. The girl who served me pulled 35 second shots (23-28 seconds is the standard for espresso shots) then poured them over the ice in my cup deluding the shots, then added milk and more ice. It tasted awful... \\n\\nIf you come here just order a regular cup of coffee or tea and then get some gelato. Don't waste your money on their \\\"more complicated\\\" drinks.\\n\\n\\nRant over. \\n\\nThey do use just coffee which is a plus!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Went there late Saturday the 15th. Enjoyed the food. Service was okay too, didn't appreciate the waitress coughing at the pickup window where there were plates of food waiting to be picked up. Definitely a real turnoff for me. Hope we don't get sick!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I had maneuvered the hungry crowds waiting on Murray for admission into Pamela's over multiple weekends and decided it was finally time, as a resident of Pittsburgh, to be one of the masses waiting street side.  Fortunately I went with just one other breakfast lover and our wait was less than the quoted 10-15 minutes.  We were ushered in after about a 5 minute wait.  The service here is fast and efficient.  After binging on leftover Halloween candy, I opted out of the famed California french toast or crepe items and instead got the more savory corned beef and Swiss omelet.  It was really delicious, and I agree that the potatoes are excellent. With quick service, good coffee, and wonderful breakfast fare, I imagine that I will be a regular sidewalk obstacle for Murray weekend pedestrians.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: LoCo is always a great place to go! It's one of my fave TT spots! The crunchy fish tacos are my fave along with the salt & pepper wings! All the bartenders & waiters/waitresses are prompt and very nice. They have a ton of TV's so if a game/fight is on you want to watch just ask. Nice new seating outside with a fire out. Inside can get really loud. I frequent here often with friends!!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: If you love to waste your time and money, then this is the company for you. I should have trusted my gut when Brad actually answered the phone in the middle of  our first meeting. We tried to refinance a house through Noble Home Loans and it was by far the worst experience (the process took 8 MONTHS) and we wasted over $1,000.00. He claims that it is illegal for his company to pay for the appraisal up front and makes the customer pay for it. Which I found out later is a complete lie. We ended up having to pay for two appraisals because his staff is incompetent and could not refinance our house in the appropriate time. After 8 months, we were told the documents were finally completed and we could go sign. We were told that we would not have to come up with any money at closing. I was unsure about that and asked them repeatedly if it was going to cost us anything. Brad and his staff said NO. When we got to the signing the gentleman asked where the money was- we owed over $1500 in closing costs. WHAT!! \\n\\nWe ended up walking away and I found an amazing loan officer that same day. Our house was financed from start to finish in less than 30 days. The closing costs were very clear from the beginning AND he paid for the appraisal up front. His motto is that the customer never has to pay for something up front. WoW!\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the gentleman that referred us to Brad end up getting in a fight with Brad as well and switched to my current loan officer. Honestly, I am baffled that this company is still in business.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Hello all,\\nWhen reviewing restaurants I use a rating system that looks at all aspects of their Menu, Decor, Food, Service & Price. A restaurant can score up to 5 points per category and a perfect score would be 25 points.\\n\\nMenu:  2 Stars: The menu was available online which I really like and it was presented in a clean and easy to read format.  I am giving a low score here because I got turned off when I saw  a vegetable tempura app on the menu of a fine dining steakhouse.  Typically I like concise menus, however this menu was lacking options.\\nDecor:  4 Stars: I found the decor and ambiance of the restaurant tomb fantastic.  I really liked the look and style, it blended well with their concept.\\nFood:  2.5 Stars: Average is all I can say about the food here.  The appetizer I selected for the table was a crab stuffed mushroom which was deep fried and served on a plate with 3 different sauces, 2 on the plate for garnish and one for dipping.  I would not order this again. My salad was terrible, I am still not sure how a fine dining steakhouse can mess up a house salad and as for my entree the only thing I liked about my steak was it's size.  Although after I cut off all the fat there wasn't much meat left.  Did not get dessert as the choices were less then impressive.\\nService: 3 Stars: I liked the fact that bottled Voss water is flowing like champagne at at a wedding at no extra charge.  The wait staff was efficient but not that which you would typically see in a fancy steakhouse.  I asked about the daily specials and for a dinner recommendation and was not impressed by their knowledge and delivery.\\nPrice: 3 Stars: I would say the average entree was $25, a little high for the location and quality but not outrageous.  Overall dinner was about $40 per person with tax & tip.\\n\\nMy overall rating, 14.5 of 25 lands this place 2 Stars, as I would not return here nor would I recommend it.  \\n\\n~Signed, Las Vegas Yelper 1116\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Hair Pollution is funky and cool.  But is that all a salon needs?  No...it also needs good hair stylists.  Like, for example, stylists that listen to what you want and will do exactly that.  My stylist, unfortunately, talked me out of the haircut I wanted, and gave me a haircut that will take some getting used to.  I wanted layers.  She said layers would make my fine hair look to wispy.  I've had a 'do with layers before, and I loved it.  But I thought, what the hay, she may know what she's talking about and give me a kick-ass 'do.  I don't like it.  The bangs I had carefully selected from a magazine are only cute when combined with the layered cut depicted in the mag.  NOT cute by themselves.  It seemed like something she should have warned me about.\\n\\nIt's not a horrible cut, and it wasn't terribly expensive ($45 -- my last salon charged $55).  I'll probably go back, but I will either limit the stylist's creative license, or else ask for someone different.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I really love the experience at Joyride! The atmosphere is very fun, the decor is colorful and trendy, and there is a lot of patio seating! I'm a huge fan of their drinks, especially those on the $5 happy hour menu, and their tacos are pretty delicious too!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I used the yelp monacle to find this place, and it was right across the street from where I was. I have driven by it a million times, and never even thought of stopping there. But I took a chance. They had an awesome deli menu, and sell boar's head meats there. But I was in the mood for pizza. I ordered a large pepperoni for my daughter, her friend and myself, and it was a giant new york style greasy pizza. Just the way I love it! I have been complaining for years that I can't find great pizza in vegas, but I guess I just gotta know where to look. If you like great cheese, grease that drips off your pizza....mmmmmm..... then this is the place for you. Also, since they serve boars head meats, im sure they make some great sandwiches too...if you want something a tad healthier. :)\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: They think that they're doing you a favor by letting you eat here. The service is beyond horrible, and they food is awful. Not to mention its so loud that the waiters can't hear your order and bring you the wrong things.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Well... The food was exactly how you would expect franchise food to be.... However the restaurant was filthy. \\nWe stopped in at 8am. Our party of ten chose to eat in. The staff member handed me a greasy order number display for our table.... While waiting for our order I took my daughter to the bathroom. The entire inside of the toilet bowl had feces coating it. A human clearly had recently exploded inside the toilet. Had it been one isolated instance of nastiness I'd understand, however, filthy order display and a filthy restroom leaves me hoping that more care was put into the food cleanliness of the food prep staff, although I don't have much hope that it was.\\nHere's hoping my meal (which was prepared correctly and tasted fine) does not yield the outcome of the previously exploded restroom visitor.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: IMHO the cuisine rates 3 stars at best.  \\nI'd award it another star for the excellent service, reasonable prices, the cozily grungy dining room and good vibes ...  but I just can't do it because it's already received too many 5 stars for a restaurant that still has plenty of room for improvement\\n\\nThose red curtains outside give the wrong impression, walking into the restaurant for the first time was a pleasant surprise. The waiter/bartender was super. He was friendly, always on top of things and struck the right balance between casual and respectful. Also for once I was not driving so I finally got to enjoy a Martini fueled dinner (plain with olives for me). \\n\\nThe Portobello tower was misnamed - it was about 2\\\" tall. No biggie in itself, that was source of amusement really. The mushroom was a bit tough, the red peppers were great but the goat cheese was that generic (cheap) kind that every restaurant uses and almost tasteless as always. If real goat cheese is not in the budget I'd rather have some feta or even blue cheese but something with a little bite to it. At $9 I can only rate it OK, not bad.  2 1/2*\\n\\nI confess that I came especially for the Spinach and Cheese Burek. I'm familiar with the Greek, Turkish and my mother's Romanian version but not the Serbian. I should have read David A's review, he did warn about the Phyllo leaves. :-[\\nYes I expected crispy and flaky layers of Phyllo with sharp cheese and fresh spinach. It's been my favorite dish since childhood. Instead I was served a large artistically shaped portion of ....dough. It looked a bit like hallah but tasted like a calzone variant. The cheese was not Casieri, Cascaval or anything of the sort, probably ricotta and it was totally bland. There was not enough spinach in it to notice. I didn't expect a calzone. \\n\\nVery possibly this is exactly what the Serbian version should be like I have no way of knowing it. Simply rating it on how tasty it was, I'd say 2 1/2 stars, but the salad that came with it was very good so together I'd rate the plate 3 stars. \\n\\nThe Moussaka was not the traditional kind either but it was excellent, it was served with a very good tomato sauce -while the Lasagna gets the bechamel, go figure. Wish it had been served with a little something on the side but the menu doesn't offer any. Still I'd rate their  Moussaka 4 stars.  \\n\\nDessert was crepes stuffed with a big mound of fruits. It kind of looked like crepes but it tasted like, and had the consistency of, American pancake - only thinner.\\n\\nThe pricing is generally moderate but inconsistent. Main dishes are only $11-13 but appetizers like humus ($9.25) corn dip w/tortillas ($9) or the Portobello I mentioned are way overpriced for this venue. Plus they don't offer any side dishes, IMO the menu needs a little tweaking and I'm offering this as constructive criticism.\\n\\nAll together it made for an enjoyable dinner and I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes. I'm thinking of the pork schnitzel and the stuffed cabbage  next time.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Private entrance, friendly check in staff. Automated elevators which is cool, although they did take us to the wrong floor multiple times. Once you check in the room, they deliver tea and cookies, although i kinda wanted to get it on with my wife right away.\\nMy biggest issue, was that it was our first time there and they put us on the bottom floor. At night we could hear the club music and our view was the rooftop. now MIND you, they put up huge dioramas of asian scenery to offset this, which was AWESOME, but being a business owner myself, you always want to put on a good show for someone, the first time they use your business.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I like this place !

There is enough room for you to move around here while still keeping the atmosphere really intimate. Heritage has a  unique drink and dinner menu (with a lot of ingredients I have never heard of!). I got a cider (they have one on tap!). We also got a bunch of appetizers including a meat and cheese plate, lamb tartare, and the shrimp tempura. The meat and cheese plate included pickled watermelon rinds which I had never had before, I thought they were good but definitely not for everyone I was with. The lamb tartare was served with potato chips and the combination was great. I didn't eat the tempura (as you can expect it's not gluten free) but everyone at the table really liked it, especially since it came with deep fried, bacon wrapped cheese curds. The menu has vegetarian and gluten free options clearly labeled. I had the chicken with crawfish cream sauce (gluten free!) for my entree and really enjoyed it. We were really impressed with the wine list as well. Only downside of Heritage Tavern is that the service is kind of slow. Our server kept leaving before anyone could ask her a question/order another drink, and it took a long time for our credit card to picked up.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: When I first walked in, it took me a couple minutes to learn the format of how you should serve yourself. Immediately you face the biggest challenge of which flavor of yogurt to chose. There is  flavor for everyone, from the indulgent to the more health-conscious. If you want, you can also mix several of the flavors if you cannot choose. One of the most important aspects is that not only can you chose how little or how much yogurt you fill in your cup, but you can chose as many toppings as you want. You pay by the weight here at Yogurtland, not the amount of toppings like other yogurt or ice cream shops. Consequently, paying by the weight makes you unsure of your final price until you pay at the register. The important thing is that regardless of your budget, you can still enjoy something here, but understand you must sacrifice the amount if you want to pay the lowest price. I have always been greeted warmly by the cashier who have kept everything well stocked from the toppings to the yogurt mix. Call me dorky, but I even liked the large plastic pink spoons that you receive. This place also has a free water dispenser if your cup tastes a little too rich. Anytime I've been here, it has been busy with people and families of all ages. Therefore, it can be extremely difficult to find a seat if you want to get comfortable and enjoy your cup.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: First off, shout out to Marti, thanks for being a gracious mixologist! \\n\\nAlso to Cameron for the amazing service, it's always great to have a waiter who can make great recommendations for all our different eating palettes!\\n\\nMy team at Zappos was going to see Wicked showcasing at The Smith Center, collectively we all decided to try Triple George to start off our evening.\\n\\nWhat a great choice.\\n\\nSitting at the Bar to treat ourselves to a cocktail during happy hour was a nice experience, Marti greeted us with a smile, and when she found out we were going to see Wicked - she had to share her personal experience from having watched the show and she was genuinely excited for the 6 of us.\\n\\nThe lovely hostess led us to our table and the charming personality of Cameron just kept our enjoyment going with refreshment offerings, as well as appetizer specials. \\n\\nFrom the Bread basket with the butter and white wine vinegar to the arrival of our Caprese Bruschetta &  Spinach dip.\\n\\nThe ambiance of this place is a bit like an old English hall which has a bit of an echoey resonance, but we felt very much secluded enough to enjoy conversation amongst ourselves.\\n\\nOur waiter Cameron was helpful in giving his insightful help to choose our next rounds of cocktails, also shortly followed by our nicely plated entrees.\\n\\nFood was great, we enjoyed the staff who interacted with us, I think I will find myself here again to enjoy another evening in the near future.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Seriously, you're a bar inside a hotel and you serve a transient clientele.

They were good and he gets a star just for him.  EXPENSIVE, but good.  $13 a shot!\\n\\nThen we went to the other room, where the bartender was a complete ass.  Seriously.  He ignored our crowd, then came over and asked as what we wanted.  When we told him, he said \\\"I can't make that at this bar\\\" and WALKED AWAY!  He didn't even ask if he could make us something else.  Dude, you work in a bar in a hotel.  I'm all for employment, but you're so NOT all that!\\n\\nThe music was decent - dance music with the occasional hip hop anthem (yay for Luniz \\\"I Got 5 On It\\\").\\n\\nIt was an awesome night out, but Tabu had little to do with that.

My stove top didn't even have knobs installed and the refrigerator didn't get cold, even after turning the controls to max., resulting in spoiled leftovers.  Housekeeping failed to make an appearance until I called them.  Also, the kid at the front desk was clearly an amateur who should be warming up at a cheaper hotel.

Kinda empty. We weren't rushed but we decided to share a drink since I wasn't really hungry so I didn't want to get stuffed. We got the matcha float. The boss recommended that we add brown sugar to it to add some sweetness. It was like drinking ice green tea brewed from hot tea! It was refreshing. It maybe a bit bland especially if you like your drinks really sweet, but my main complaint is things are always too sweet and this was perfect. The boss was really nice and he does recommend things to you and gives suggestions. The people who were working up front with orders and the cashier seemed to struggle a little. But considering this place is new they were still really nice and provided service. They corrected our order because originally they gave us just an ice matcha tea without the ice cream but it was corrected in no time. We played some jenga. The owner said whoever the first winner of jenga is gets a fruit tart. I won! :D. But because I'm nice I shared it with my BF who lost twice btw ;).\\n\\nSecond visit, the place was pretty much packed and not as empty as it was the very first time. Once again I just wanted a drink! No matter what set of chairs or tables you pick they're really comfy and there are board games you can all play together! This time I came with my bf and his brother. I got the jasmine iced tea with boba. OMG the jasmine tea was so good!! I can't even tell you that it had the brewed tea taste AND it wasn't extremely sweet either! PERFECT! The boba was a little too chewy for me.

We had teriyaki salmon, and it was just awesome.  Ever since, we've been meaning to go by and try their real food.\\n\\nSo we went.  I'd have to agree with a lot of others in that the atmosphere is just a little too stuffy for my own personal taste.  It's a nice place, and you really don't have to dress up - we went in jeans - but it's just so \\\"pretty\\\".  The staff is nice, they are relatively attentive and all, but it just seems so wrong.  I'd much rather go somewhere that's a little grizzled.\\n\\nIn any case the menus were delivered and we decided to try the spring roll appetizers, and they were actually quite good.  I liked that there were two of us, and they split the appetizer onto two plates.  That's a nice touch.  Most places give you one plate and you're left to do it yourself.  Another nice thing is that the bread comes with melted butter.  That's cool.\\n\\nI ordered the sea bass, on the suggestion of the server, who said it is \\\"far and away\\\" the best thing on the menu, while my wife had a sirloin.  The flavor of the fish was good, but it was just so sponge-like I had a difficult time eating it.  The texture was just strange.  The steak, meanwhile, was really good.  Odd, at a seafood place.\\n\\nOverall, it was decent, but it wasn't cheap by any means.

When we finally got inside we were seated near huge glass windows that showed us the night view of the Strip- very pretty!  \\n\\nThere is a large international selection of foods at the buffet, and most of the fare tasted fine. Nothing was spectacular, and nothing was horrible. The deserts looked and tasted like the standard array you get at the casinos buffets. The meal came to about $100 for the five of us.\\n\\nThe casino itself is nicely-designed, although casinos tend to all look alike. The one thing that made this casino a little different was the self-service beverage station. Instead of waiting for a scantily clad woman to bring you your drink, those who prefer non-alcoholic beverages can service themselves.  Unfortunately, patrons can be slobs, so the station was sloppy. Too bad people have to ruin a good thing.\\n\\nMy opinion of M is that it is nice-looking and offers a nice off-Strip place for locals to visit. I wouldn't want to stay there if I were visiting Vegas because I'd rather be on the Strip where all the action is, but if you want to be away from the Strip and still have the casino experience, this would do. As for the buffet, though I liked it, it is not worth more than 15 minutes in line.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Wow... A good burger joint from California not named \\\"In-N-Out\\\".

I went with an al pastor and an asada taco along with a Mexican corn.  \\n\\nAs I sat in my car looking at the food, I frequently compared what I saw with what I get at El Gordo.  I feel the tacos are slightly larger at EG.  Also believe the pastor at EG is more flavorful.  Frankly, I found the TT food had little flavor.

They were  fast and efficient.  The food was good but a little over priced for the offering.  Very good wine and atmosphere.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: The only thing this place has going for it is the marketing.     The food is WAY overhyped and underwhelming.  There are taco trucks here in Vegas with far superior Mexican food.     Don't get me started on the \\\"shareable\\\" chips and salsa that I had to pay for.     There wasn't enough salsa for ME let alone anyone else.   Unless this place wakes the hell up I hope it goes the way of Agave & Dos Caminos.

One was a hockey jersey from my defunct Worcester IceCats whose jersey felt like a XXXL when labeled as L and an ASU Basketball jersey that ran too long for comfort. I went to google and searched for good reviews for tailors and alterations.\\n\\nI called three stores and received firm answers stating \\\"we don't alter jerseys\\\". When I called Smart Fit Alterations I was given a confident \\\"yes, we will assist\\\". Upon arriving to the store I saw a wedding dress in the window, sucked up my masculinity, and knew I was placing my clothes in the hands of professionals. Within 10 minutes the jerseys were sized, money exchanged, and a wait of 10 days took place before my clothes were ready.\\n\\nI had read a review stating that their phone etiquette left something to be desired. A brash \\\"Hello.\\\" with no business company tagline prompted my question on today's hours for MLK Day. Another brash \\\"Yes.\\\" was met and I got into my car to receive my clothes.\\n\\nUpon arrival my clothes were given back to me clean in plastic and altered to perfection. My XXXL jersey fit like any hockey jersey should and a shortened length to my basketball jersey were both perfectly altered. Although the phone skills leave much to be desired, you can not take away from these ladies (yes, two women run the business) on their alteration skills.\\n\\nTWO THUMBS UP! $34 + $14 = $48 saved my jerseys and I will be sure to have my shirts tailored by Smart Fit in the future as well.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Tried the Diplo- a saison I'd love to drink all day!

But, as with other hotel-casinos, it'sbeing de-themed, which to me is a shame.  After all, the Egyptian theme was supposed to be the big draw to get people in the door.  I think it still draws people in, but once inside you're like, okaaaaaaay, so this is it?  Then it's on to the next stop.\\n\\nThe casino is fine for gambling.  All the usual selections are present.  I played a Wizard of Oz machine for quite some time without an appearance from a cocktail waitress.  So moved on to the next stop to find a waitress willing  to provide me with a complimentary cool, refreshing adult beverage to quench my thirst.  Excaliber filled the ticket in that department.\\n\\nThe tram that runs between Excaliber and Mandalay Bay makes a stop at Luxor on the way back.  So that saves some time walking in the hot sun if you're out and about during the day.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Came to Vegas for a friend's birthday and was stuck in a handicap accessable room (not what we previously booked). Hotel staff wasn't friendly and always seemed distracted. Was kept up until after midnight on 10/20 due to laud music from the hotel pool. We were on the 31st floor, so I can't imagine what the lower floors were experiencing. I called down to the front desk, and their only solution was ear plugs which I already had. Called again, then they blamed the noise on the Four Seasons. No apologies, just a suck it up sort of attitude. Upon checkout, spoke with the manager and encountered the same sort of demeanor. I thought this was supposed to be a nice hotel, but my experience was anything but.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place has horrible customer service. I called them twice and left messages, no one ever called me back. I called them again and talked with someone about doing a cake for my sisters shower. I had a design in mind and emailed it to them while on the phone. I was told that they wouldn't be able to get back to me about it until after the weekend. Why does it 3 days to look at an email? I was finally sent an email saying the design was too much because it involved fondant and they couldn't help me. That doesn't even warrant a phone call? What a horrible business.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I got my tickets for $30 at the tix 4 less, sales stands along the strip.  This was something both my friend and I, really wanted to see, we are really into the vampire books.  Yes we are both straight, seeing topless women is like being at the gym locker room, no big deal.  Sadly we were 30 mins late to the show, because of the construction for those darn condos!  Ugh!  So try to leave like 2 hours before the show if you are on the other side of the strip.  \\n\\nAll in all, I liked the show.  The music made me smile because it was so rock n' roll 80's style.  The guy who sang did a really good job.  The women are so skinny and in shape, made me feel like a cow, but I still enjoyed watching them dance.  I had a great time and got to take some pictures with the cast members after the show.  I would see this play again if I could...who knows?\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I went in there today and Nancy was my esthician. She was very nice and sweet. Not only that, but she did a phenomenal job! I felt like I was at home but treated like royalty at this spa. They have a relaxation room, showers, & a hot tub. I would highly recommend going to this spa for a nice day to get pampered.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Came here for their lunch special and got the chicken bento box. Soup was included (choice of miso or tum yum) in my order and you get a choice of chicken katsu or teriyaki chicken if you order the chicken bento box. The staff are friendly and the decor inside is nice.\\n\\nThe tum yum soup was okay and the portion size felt like it was small. The price for the meal all together was around $10.\\n\\nDon't forget to check-in on yelp for the free thai tea! =P\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: While the food was not expensive and the service was very good, the food just wasn't very good. The decor is also dated, having that 1970s tropical feel to it.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This club has honestly hired the most inept people. I was thrown out for allegedly throwing beer when I was 100% not even close to doing that. Worst club I've been to in Vegas and I've been to several clubs in this town. If you want to have fun here go to marquee or hakkasan for the love of god skip this abortion of a club.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Came by the place when it was fresh and new, saw the big menu board mentioned in a review below, and saw outdoor only seating.  We were chilly by the time we approached the hostess stand, so we decided to run back home and make our own pancakes.\\n\\nBut now - totally different experience!  They are using in and outdoors - which if you ask me is ALWAYS how it should be no matter what the weather is like. I love eating outside.  Some folks have that bug-attracting-gene and never have good outdoor eating experiences.  But I digress.... so there's no more hostess stand, which actually threw us off a bit as we walked in, but someone saw us and ran right over so that works for me (pssst - I'd bring back the hostess stand!).\\n\\nThe omelets are a good size, but not TOO big.  The Belgian waffle is nice and fluffy.  They had a Banana Nut pancake special when we were there that looked tasty.  The wife really wanted plain pancakes, but only the special and blueberry were on the menu.  We saw someone else getting plain pancakes (that looked a-frickin-mazing) and asked the server about it.  Apparently you can order the blueberry pancakes and just say \\\"hold the blueberry\\\".  Good to know!\\n\\nSo, food was good, it's beautiful to look at but let me mention something here that no one else has yet.  This is a spot that folks rent out for weddings or big parties.  We first came to this place well before they were doing food when we were looking for a wedding location.  Want to know why  the wall decor is super simple and the space doesn't \\\"feel\\\" like a restaurant?  Because last night it was a pink princess themed wedding and later tonight it will be a Bar Mitzvah.  That outdoor dining space is the dance floor one night and happy hour spot the next.  This will also explain why they have a table set up near the entry with wedding photo books and other similarly themed things. \\n\\nSpeaking of that - lets talk about folks working there.  On our first time eating there a woman came up to us as we were leaving and asked if we'd finally gotten married.  Haven't seen her in at least 8 months, and only talked to her 2-3 other times before that, but she stopped to mention it and say congrats.  Heck of a memory - and extra sweet since we obviously hadn't chosen her location (though it was one of the top 3!)\\n\\nNice spot.  Nice view.  Nice food.  Nice folks.  Definitely the kind of place you want to enjoy, and support.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: What a great place! Comfortable, welcoming and most importantly; delicious!\\n\\nStarted with crab gazpacho, smoked salmon and chive grilled cheese, deviled eggs and a tomato/ polenta/avacados salad. All 4 of them were great! I would suggest all 4 of them as starters.\\n\\nFor dinner, the 4 of us, we split 3 entrees; the burger, lobster roll and tacos (three fish, one octopus). The burger and tacos were amazing. The burger, may be the best is town! White bun, great meat with the perfect amount of seasoning, the secret sauce with iceberg lettuce. Nothing fancy, but perfectly done. Friggin great!! The fish tacos were huge and soo good! Both salsas were extremely flavorful. I liked the fish over the octopus, but it was close. The octopus was meatier than I expected and grilled to perfection.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was ehhh, but take with a grain of salt, as I am not a huge fan of lobster.\\n\\nTavern only serves beer and wine. \\n\\nThis is a top-notch restaurant with very attentive service! I can't wait to come back!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: BEAUTIFUL hotel. I love the sleek, modern look of this place for both the room itself and the hotel in general. It's a good contrast from it's sister hotel Mandalay Bay (which is more sunny and colorful), this is more of a cooler, darker look. On decor and service itself, I'd give this place a 4.5.\\n\\nHere's why I ended up giving it a 3\\n\\n- Having a room on a high floor has it's consequences. The music coming from Mix Lounge was so obnoxiously loud that I could hear it from the bathroom, with the door closed. This can either be a bad/doesn't matter thing. On the one hand, it's Vegas so no one sleeps that early anyway ( I think they stopped by 2am. It was a weekday) but on the other, my bf and I had an early flight to catch the next morning so we couldn't fall asleep. It was pretty damn loud.\\n- Our shower smelled like sulfur and it was strong enough that we had to leave the bathroom and close the door. It was bad enough that neither of us would even dare use the shower. The weird thing is the bathtub was completely fine. When we called guest services to complain, we were surprised to hear \\\"we've gotten this complaints from lower floors but not from the high floors.\\\" So you're telling me you're aware of this problem and haven't done anything about it? Boo\\n- Dirty stains on the sheets right when we came in. It was the first thing we noticed because it was pretty big\\n\\nOverall, I think this hotel has one of the nicest decors I've ever seen but those problems really brought the rating down. I will say this though, the hotel staff was very quick to fix our problems (our sheets were changed within 5 minutes) and were very accommodating (they offered us a free night stay for next time, if we ever decided to come back)\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: They were very busy for breakfast and had trouble with their time management. My husband's Eggs Benedict was delivered by the manager without the ham... Waiter never checked on us... I had the baja omelet. It was a good choice.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: BLD is the one place in Chandler that I really want to like, but after three visits, I just give up. They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.\\n\\nA disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.\\n\\nNext, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.\\n\\nThe one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.\\n\\nLike the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.\\n\\nBLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Best pho on this side of town.  Not as good as the Spring Mountain location, but a really good substitute when you can't make it across town.  Egg rolls are the bomb, chicken bun is one of my faves, and the #31 is my go to dish!\\n\\nBiggest drawback is the service is kind of slow.  Food comes out pretty quick but sometimes it can be a wait to get drinks and/or the check.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Food was great! Service was spectacular! We had a birthday dinner here and they set us up in a private room. The decor is quaint and cute.  Loved the steak and Chicken Cajun shrimp, delicious! They made my son feel so special on his bday! We will be back for many more dinners.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This review is for the lunch buffet here at India's Grill.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is nice inside, modern looking with it's \\\"open pipe\\\" ceiling, such as is popular around here right now.  Soft Indian music played in the background, & both booths & tables are available for seating.\\n\\nMy server brought over plenty of hot, seasoned Naan bread as I went for some of their vegetable soup, to find that only tiny bowls were available to get some of it in!  Not only that, the soup spoons, at least the one I was given, were just the opposite...huge, almost serving spoon size!\\n\\nBack at the booth, the table was too far away.  If you pulled it in to be the right distance out on one side, you could drive a Mahindra truck through on the other side without running over Desirupa's feet!  Then, back over at the serving table, some of the foods were labeled & some not.\\n\\nOk, so 2-Stars & we're out of here, right?  Well, not so fast.  For one, the soup in the thimble ...ur, tiny bowl, was delicious!  The salad actually had SALAD DRESSING available for it (which is amazing for an Indian buffet)!  The temperature of everything was about right, the foods weren't too soupy, as they sometimes are at these places, & the taste of everything was excellent for the most part, if a little salty.  They do fix it real spicy here, so if you come, leave the kids at McDonald's & keep your glass of water (& a forehead napkin) close at hand!\\n\\nLunch Buffet $8.95 includes hot Indian style tea.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I love their service, however they were just bought out & don't offer any new activations in Vegas. I tried to get my mom signed up yesterday & they couldn't do it. If anyone knows of unlimited internet service with no contract for 50$ let me know.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Our realtor recommended Assure.  After some brief checking about the company, my wife and I had no reason to go against the realtor's recommendation.  My first bit of apprehension started when I asked to be present for the inspection and to be allowed to shadow inspector while he did his job.  This was mainly for my own piece of mind about the flipped property we were about to purchase.  I was dissuaded from being present.  I could have forced the issue but had no reason not to trust their integrity or ability.  \\n\\nDuring our walk-through with the inspector, after he examined the house, he provided us a very concise, professional and helpful report, complete with pictures and explanations.  He gave the house an outstanding thumb up, finding just a few minor issues.\\n\\nFast forward two weeks.  It was our first full day in the house and we had several contractors working around the house and in the attic.  One by one they contacted us with moderate to more than one major issue that they discovered just walking the property and attic.  The issues included duct work damage, water/dry wall damage, electrical work out of code and HVAC issues.  Mind you these contractors were not there to address those issues; they simply observed them as they jumped out to someone versed in the construction business.  \\n\\nThis type of thing continued for approximately 9 months and expanded to include plumbing, additional electric and roofing issues.  Every time we had a worker discover a new issue we heard the same mantra, \\\"Didn't you have a home inspection?\\\"  We are now over $10,000 into the house just to fix issues that other contractors agreed should have been easily found during the initial home inspection.  \\n\\nThe most disappointing part of the story is that after getting our realtor involved, who had used this company for years, the owner, Tom Sanders, refused to contact me to discuss what I thought was an inadequate inspection.  After more than two weeks of arguing, Mr. Sanders finally gave in and left a voicemail on my phone.  I returned his call less than an hour later, got his voicemail and left a message.  I never heard back.  To this day, and after several angry calls to him, he has only ever contact me once to discuss the situation.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Good food. Had the chicken kabobs. Comes w/ rice (or fries) and salad. Quite a bit of food. Could almost share between 2 people. A little pricey for the kabob plates ($11-13) but considering the quantity and quality I was okay with the value. Will definitely return. Pleasant mom and pop working the place when I was there.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I've been going to this Jiffy Lube location since I moved here almost 6 years ago.  I drive from my current home in Downtown Phoenix to go there!\\nI have a rare car.  Nobody ever has the right tool to take the oil filter out, except for this location.  I've tried other Jiffy Lubes and they've had to order the tool.\\nYesterday, I went for my quarterly oil change.  They didn't have the proper filter.  They gave me the choice of either going back in a few hours or staying put.  None of the auto parts stores had it.  Only the VW dealership in North Scottsdale.  I stayed put, and one of the service techs drove to the dealership, picked up the part AND called me when he was on his way back.  Hey, I was out of the office for this and another half hour from work on a Friday wasn't gonna kill me!\\nThey threw in free wiper blades to make up for my wait.  Changed all my filters - air, A/C AND, of course, the oil.\\nULTRA-friendly staff, service was excellent.  They normally vacuum my car, but I told them to skip it since I had to detail my car the next day anyway.  \\\"Are you sure, Amy?\\\"\\nThey knew my name, used it often during my visit, and didn't treat me like a bimbo for being a woman in an auto car place.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Not the best native, but it isn't bad.  They have a nice sized menu and a decent beer selection.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Had high hopes of finding good Indian since being jaded by blue tajs overpriced food. Having travelled India loads.. Here is my quick review\\n\\nTerrible service, waited an hour!!\\nIndian families who can after us were served first\\nGot handed a dirty plate\\nRaita and shrimp curry was alright, more South Indian style bit sweet, like sambar\\nNot mind blowing \\nTried chicken curry too just so so, stomach started feeling bit strange. \\nGot bill when we weren't done. \\nDon't recommend this place.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: My boyfriend and I didn't mind waiting the 45 min because it was Carlos Bakery.  I ordered  the mini cheesecake with fruit, he had the raspberry tart.  I kid you not the cheesecake had no flavor and the raspberry tart was two dried cookies with jam in the middle.  I wouldnt have minded paying for overpriced pastries if they were any good.  Sadly they were TERRIBLE.  Don't waste an hour of your life on below par crap.  Makes me wonder if Carlos bakery is just pure hype.  Zero stars\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Very friendly staff, nice interior of restaurant. I always judge Indian restaurants on the following:\\n-Saag with Shrimp - best saag I've had in Las Vegas. I ordered it a 0/10 for spiciness and it came out mild like I asked for. The shrimp was way overcooked and chewy, so I might order it plain next time.\\n-Chicken Tikka Masala - ok. My friend loved it. I thought it was a little sweet & tangy.\\n-Garlic Naan - very good.\\n-Lacha Paratha - terrible. They really shouldn't have served it to us in the condition it was in. It came out like some crackers falling apart. It was so dry and crumbly that we really didn't eat it. Very disappointed in this and wasn't crazy about the $4.50 price tag.\\nI liked this place overall and will come back, but will modify my order a bit next time.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I make it a point to go once a month at least... I have to admit I am a foodie... so I go to lots of restaurants. Some of them keep me coming back. Napoletana is one of them... maybe even my favorite in the city. The food is outstanding, the quality of the ingredients is excellent and it's consistent. Love it! \\n(FYI: It's BYOW)\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Stayed here with people while we were canvassing for Obama during the election time. This hotel is exactly what you would expect from a cheaper hotel in Las Vegas. The rooms are kind of janky, Wifi is not free, and it smells like smoke everywhere!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I had a deal for a facial and massage.  I walked in and filled out my paperwork.  I got right in on time to my facial.  It was fantastic.  One of the best I have ever had.  I wanted to use the restroom before my facial but the lock was broken on the door.  Anyways, I got into my massage on time.  This is where it got disappointing.  I told the massage therapist to do a 3 on a scale of 1-5 but she did it too hard.  I asked her to lighten up but it still was too painful.  I have had many massages before and this was the worst.  She also talked a lot.\\n\\nUpon checkout, I was talked to forever about signing up for their plan.  But how can I do that after that massage?  I would go back for a facial but they are so expensive compared to other places.  \\n\\nThe place was clean and it was a very comfortable environment.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Tried their guitar lessons for my child. Will never go there again. The teacher was so foul tempered, he broke the strings off my child's instrument on her second lesson; no apologies; blamed her for having the wrong kind of instrument; ranted the rest of what was left of the half hour lesson  and told her she needs to buy the second more expensive book. This may not reflect on all their teachers, but for me - this it it with music masters.\\n\\nWhat was worse is, when I reported this to the management - they were not apologetic at all until I told him I may report this.  He was justifying the behavior and said some parents like teachers to be that way. What parents are those???? :) No kiddin. \\n\\nAnyway, to their credit, he fixed the damaged instrument free of cost. He also gladly accepted the first book that I was asked to purchase on day one - for charity. Did not offer to refund, so I did not ask. Don't want anything to do with them anymore.\\n\\nI am sure there are better, healthier places out there for innocent music loving kids.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I normally want to avoid a kitschy place like this that white-washes everything. Well, it proved me wrong.\\n\\nThis place had the most outstanding service of any place, pho or otherwise, that I've been to, especially on a packed Friday evening. Quick table, ordering, and constantly making sure I was doing good. It took a little longer for the pho, but when it's a packed house, it's understandable. They seemed to work quick and hard there, even fixing up some messed up orders at the table next to me.\\n\\nHad a typical pho tai, which was served already in the broth. Again, understandable to help ease health concerns, but still trying to find a place where I can cook it to my liking. The broth is as the other reviewers have said: flavorless. I had to mix in other condiments, but I did like their version of sriracha. Price point was also a negative as well.\\n\\nOverall, it was a fine place, with the only dings being the price and bland broth, but the service really makes me like being there. I would definitely be open to future visits.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Dr Patty is the best, love her she is like family\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This is a topless show.  Thought it would um \\\"put me in the mood\\\" but definitely was not up to my expectations. Not enough acrobatic like the usual cirque du soleil shows.  Some parts were funny but not hilarious.  The theater is actually really small.  Our sides were close to the stage but it was on the side and most of the time I couldn't really see what was going on since the performers faced the center of the stage.\\n\\nOverrall just a lot of boobies.  Men were not that Hot.  I was not impressed and I really don't like Fabio looking guys with long hair. Ick!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I am a fan of Cirque du Soleil and Elvis is nice but this show just does not do it for me.  They use a lot of clips from his movies and the dancing was nice but you never get the excitement of the Cirque Du Soleil like other shows.  I would not suggest this one to folks visiting unless they do some serious rework and figure out how to tell the story but get the excitement back into the show.

{"prompt": "Sentence: My wife and I celebrated Valentine's on Thursday 2/13, always avoid 2/14, all restaurants way too crowded.  Anyhow, Don and Charlie's was crowded but fortunately, I had made reservations.  They hit the mark right on, we were seated right on time.  Because this was our first visit, Pam, our exceptional waitress, comped us the parmesan bread and it is delicious...next time we visit, I will gladly pay for the scrumptious bread.  The menu is vairied, lots of beef and ribs, seafood and more.  I won't go into what we ate because I humbly believe that whatever you order will be delicious and plentiful.  The atmosphere is a little noisy but that's OK, the vibe makes for the dining experience.  You could go crazy looking at all the sports memorabelia, if you are sports fan, any sport, you will find something to ooh and ahh over.  I have to repeat, Pam our waitress was terrific.  They were unusually busy that night because of a large take-out order that came as a surprise to the restaurant and the wait for our main dish was a little long.  Pam made sure we were informed that all was in order and to be candid, it was nice having a little time between our salads and the main dish.  I understand that a diner or two could have a less than perfect visit to any restaurant but I don't understand how anyone could rate Don and Charlie's anything less than 5 stars.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks to Pam, you helped make my Valentine's weekend.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Wow, what a turn around this airline has had.  The aircraft are in great shape and they consistently get me where I am headed in a timely manner.\\n\\nLooking forward to the first class seats on their regional jets (this is a MUCH needed upgrade)\\n\\nKeep up the good work!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Embarrassingly bad experience after parking my car 20 minutes away, pushing my way through hordes of people, and showing up to join my friends who were waiting for me inside, and being rudely turned away by the \\\"gentleman\\\" at the front door. He claimed the restaurant was closed and insisted that my friends were not inside the restaurant. Yes this actually happened just tonight. He would not let me in to show him that they were in fact there and enjoying food and drinks. The restaurant was obviously full of people, including my four friends who were wondering where I was. I will never ever go here and I will not recommend that anyone else put up with such treatment. I will spend my money elsewhere.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Definitely an interesting concept of fusing Chinese and Mexican cuisine. It is an eating experience that you won't forget, and while I have mixed feelings on the experience, overall I think it was a good one. If you're a first timer to Chino, it can be a little overwhelming listening to their 10 minute introduction on how to order and combine the different foods. The lady was very helpful in her explanation, and I ended up telling her to give me whatever she liked best. The food itself was pretty good overall, I enjoyed some of the combinations a lot more than others. I think as you keep eating at Chino, you would eventually hone your choice of combinations down to what you would best enjoy. For a visitor, I left with an experience and some pretty decent food.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: The place looks pretty promising. That changes the moment you talk to one of the cashiers. I asked her about one of the items in the menu, and she looked really puzzled. She then answered that she doesn't know at all mainly because she doesn't work in the kitchen. That right there is a bright red flag that I probably should have left. As someone that works at a restaurant, you should be well aware of what it is you're selling. Not only that but she also made various mistakes on our order. All of this was going on while manager was clearly standing next to her. He did absolutely nothing to help us or clarify anything. The food, itself, is not as appetizing especially for it's price. I do not recommend getting the sisig fries. It was pretty disgusting.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I fell in love with Lotus of Siam on previous visits to Las Vegas.  In fact I have given up Thai restaurants in the San Francisco area, since they rarely compare.  Sunday lunch brought me to a \\\"closed\\\" sign at Lotus.  Luckily I used Yelp to find another Thai restaurant.  I was amazed that Komol was so close to Lotus, pleasantly surprised that it was open, and ecstactic with the quality of the food and friendly service.  This is an excellent choice for vegetarians (60% of their business is the vegetarian dishes).  I immensely enjoyed the pork panang, and look forward to sampling the fish dishes on future and frequent visits.  I agree with the comments on the spice level; use caution, especially on an initial visit.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that Las Vegas has two excellent Thai restaurants within a hundred yards of each other, when I cannot find comparable Thai food within a hundred miles of my home.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Finally made a reservation after months of wanting to try this place. Got there a little early and was seated right away (what a plus, rarely happens). Water came right away. Service was great and atmosphere was pleasant. I planned on spending 150-200(without tip) on this dinner..Boy did I walk away happy and a little heavy in the pocket book.\\n\\nGetting right to it, I ordered the broiled swordfish with truffle fries. My gf ordered scallops with macadamia nuts and citrus. We ordered a caesar salad, spinach sauteed in garlic and shallots, and truffle mac n cheese. Wow! Meals were surprisingly plentiful and looked great. My swordfish was excellent (firm yet succulent) and the fries were surprisingly good and plentiful. The scallops were good, I've had better but there were about 6/7 large sized which is unusual. The mac n cheese was so tasty (asiago, parm, w/truffles). Spinach was excellent. Well prepared not too garlicky or oniony(such words) idk...but nonetheless, great!\\n\\nI broke down and ordered dessert (the waiter advised us in the beginning that its takes 15 min). Came out on fire, literally..A pineapple upside down cake with rum (i think), whipped cream, and a divine caramel sauce! OMG..the other table was gawking over the setting. It was incredible, a must try! \\n\\nOverall, this was a great place. Unpretentious, elegant yet casual enough..I WILL be going back..Oh yeah, 100 bucks including two glasses of 7 Merlot that was easy on the palate!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I went to Silky's Crows Nest last night with a friend as it was a gorgeous day and we wanted a nice, outside ambiance. This hit the spot! The deck was gorgeous and the view of the marina was the best of the Allegheny.\\n\\nHowever, there were several things that made our evening go downhill.\\n\\nWhen we arrived there was no server to greet us and stood several minutes with others until someone took care of us.\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to order appetizers to share around 7pm. Chicken nachos, fried zucchini slices and waffle fries. 2.5 hrs later we still did NOT have our food and others around us did (even those who came in after us). This was absolutely ridiculous!!!!  I could feel myself fuming. \\n\\nI decided to speak to the manager on duty and they took one appetizer off our bill. For all the time we had to wait it should have been free! \\n\\nWhen the food finally came it was not even that good, but we ate it anyway since we were starving...\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I like this place because it is one of the very few places that serve Illy coffee. It reminded me of a cafe in Rome. Located in the Cosmopolitan, it is convenient place to get your coffee and food to go. Also, they have quick eats here like sandwiches, salads, and pastries. The place doesn't have a table, but you can stand and get a quick bite. There is no better place for your coffee than Va Bene.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Panda Express, I wish I could quit you! Especially after I stupidly keep coming back to this location. The staff here can't multi-task. When they try to, that's when people's food starts to get mixed up and down and around. Let's focus on one person at a time. That's great that you want to help 10 people at a time but again the staff can't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you'd like a 3 item entree. *slow blinks* He's way too flustered. \\n\\nYou guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly have to remind you for the third item like 5 times? \\n\\nThe last time I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain wasn't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take our order.  Eventually something clicked up there that paying customers were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting to get service. OMG\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I have been to Oggi's many many many times. The food has always been great, the service is always helpful and accommodating but the beer is even better. You come to a pizza and beer place for just that but they give you so much more. Enjoy!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Clever Koi is located on this cool little stretch of Central Avenue in the same area as Central Wine Bar.  The decor is beautiful and well done, the staff is friendly and the food and drinks are quite good.  We tried the corn dog bites, the edamame fritters and the wood fired grilled plate for our entrees.  It was all pretty good, but nothing to rush back for.  However, the drinks were tasty and well mixed - I highly recommend the Marvin Gardens...yummy!\\n\\nI will definitely be back for happy hour and hope the menu might get changed up a little bit.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Service is bad, bad, bad. Although the food is okay portion, the staff there brings this rating way down. \\n\\nI was there during a lunch rush, although it wasn't completely slammed, a female server was heard yelling from the kitchen about how SHE IS F****** WORKING!!!! Crickets after that and everyone in the dining area turned that direction in complete shock. \\n\\nAside from this little mishap,  you can't get seated, order you meal, get your check and pay in a timely fashion at all. I almost left exact change when I got my bill, but decided tip lite anyway. \\n\\nFood is full of grease, just about everything on their lunch menu is fried. What a disappointment. \\n\\nI won't be back and I hope for the sake of this place they will consider hiring staff with some customer service skills. \\n\\nOh and WTF, FOX news is the only news network they show!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I came here on Monday to celebrate Father's Day. My brother recommended this place. We went during happy hour, nice happy hour selection! A lot of rolls to choose  from. I also liked the Hawaiian fusion they had to their food. However, maybe it was the day, but I thought the fish could have been fresher. I also ordered the fish tacos which were good but  I was not expecting them to be fried. Therefore, I would also suggest adding fish tacos that do not have fried fish to the menu.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So Opa Life has taken over the space formally occupied by My Big Fat Greek Express as apparently the parent company of Opa Life bought out MBFGE per my conversation with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed here was that they did a really nice job renovating the old space that was dingy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing.\\n\\nSadly the second thing I noticed was the sticker shock of this place compared to MBFGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up across the board.\\n\\nI got the special which was a combo deal of chicken pita, drink and a side for $9. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on the pita it was pretty much red onion and taziki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked.\\n\\nThey just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it will be hard to convince myself to come this way often.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I almost want to only give 1 start in hopes I can get seated faster, but that is my only complaint which means you are doing the simple things to perfection. Finally got to bring my girlfriend here on Saturday 8/10/13, arrived around 7pm, told a 30 minute wait, not bad in my opinion. We moved the car closer, then just decided to head down to the Waterfront to waste some time. 40 minutes later my cell rang and we were seated. Now the wait for food was much longer that I would have liked, but it was well worth every second! I don't even know where to start. I ordered the brisket, ribs and chicken apple tacos, she had the chicken and the brisket and we shared the jalapeno apple slaw and of course the mac n cheese. We wanted to try the chorizo but they were out. (just an excuse to come back and fuel my new addiction). The next time we will be getting our own mac n cheese that's for sure! I cannot say what taco was the best because they were all so good and unique in their own way. Experiment with their sauces as well. I got the Smoke 3 pepper and the apricot habanero, without any sauce and then trying one of the other completely changed the flavor profile in to something new, each bite incredible.\\n\\nThe place and the menu are very simple, but the real star is the food! KEEP IT THIS WAY! Never sell out!\\n\\nAlso, the staff was amazing, each one helping the other out, no one went without attention.\\n\\n\\nI will be there often Smoke, thank you for a new \\\"addiction\\\"\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We eat here for breakfast every time we are in Vegas. On our last trip (923/10 to 9/27/10) we decided we try another place closer to the strip and it only made us appreciate the Sourdough Cafe more! Our steaks are always cooked to order, the over easy eggs are NOT greasy and the coffee is good! \\n\\nWe usually just dine and dash but this time we were wonderfully surprised with a NO SMOKING room to play video poker! I was one happy girl with a cup of hot joe, video poker and smoke free air-all in one casino!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The manager Amy Walter on 407 E Green Street in Champaign, IL is horrible. I bought an HP ink the day before but the ink can't print, I went to the store to ask for returning and she slandered me, saying I took my old one there. I don't think I will sell my integrity for a 20 bucks ink. Ridiculous mean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I found myself in Phoenix, and the Golden Coin called out to me.\\n\\nWas it the minimal selection of only 8 or 9 options, at least two of them not at all Chinese, that brought me back? Certainly, I ate my fill of crisp wonton strips, fried rice, egg rolls, stir-fried vegetables, and the inevitable sweet and sour pork. I avoided completely the fried chicken and the french fries, and didn't regret my choice. I tried the chow mein noodles but didn't go back for more. I lamented the lack of lemon chicken, a favorite of mine from when I came here over 20 years ago.\\n\\nWas it the price? $7 and change for your fill of Chinese food and a drink is pretty reasonable by any standard, even if the selection isn't much to look at and the food itself doesn't stand out either. Service is kept to a minimum - your money (cash only please!) is taken as you enter and water and/or a soda of your choice is brought to a table chosen for you while you load up your plate. Empty plates are taken away regularly, and food is replenished periodically from behind the mysterious doors where it sounds like a lot of cooking is happening.\\n\\nWas it the ambience of a cash-only business with a single room for seating, the sounds of the cooking behind the scenes nearly drowned out by the sound of someone watching their Chinese film on a portable DVD player behind the counter? The worn tables and plastic plates that look just as they did 20 years ago, shaped vaguely like alien faces from the classic 1950's version of 'War of the Worlds'?\\n\\nThe truth is that it was all of these things. Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is neither great nor terrible. The selection is limited, the food only fair (though I love those wonton crisps!), the service is minimal, and the price is right. But Golden Coin remains today mostly like what it was 20+ years ago, right down to the worn tables and the alien-face plates. Walking in and smelling the food is a strong dose of nostalgia, and remains a consistent experience in a world filled with change.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Do not visit the GOLD LOUNGE for OPEN BaR!!!!!

I liked the jars of ingredients and its calm, hip tone to the restaurant. Fresh from playing cards from Caesars, my buddies wanted some asian noodles in the bellagio. The wait to get in was about 20-30mins. I wasn't pissed at line to get in (other people in the line were, especially a group of trekkies?) \\n\\nI mean its Vegas and gamblers have to eat sometime? \\n\\nSo, we sat down ordered and I decided to go with some spicy chicken noodle dish. It was quite hot and spicy when I tasted it. It took a total of 5 mins for them to muster it up. I was shocked at the cooking times of this noodle joint and I think I knew why.... Because 10mins after my meal, I could not hold it down. I spent prolly the next hour in the casino's well maintained bathrooms. I was hurling my brains out and spewing chunks. \\n\\nThis was one of the worst food experiences.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Make that a tray please!\\n\\nAny place that has chicken nuggets, chicken quesadillas and corn dogs has a side is a-okay with me!\\n\\nWhen I need a really good hamburger quick, Cookout is my go to spot! You can smell that grilled smokey goodness a mill before you get to the actual drive thru. Being that this location is so close to UNC Charlotte it gets pretty crowded on the weekends, so the double drive thru really helps get cars in and out. There's also a walk up window you can order at too. Like most Cookout locations there's no dine in eating area. They've got a couple of seats outside but just take your food and go home and eat.\\n\\nThe menu has a good selection of burgers, hotdogs, BBQ and chicken sandwiches. You can turn any meal into a tray, getting two sides and a drink. As I mentioned earlier these aren't typical sides, goes way above fries...the sides within themselves can be a meal. Want something sweet? They've have several different flavors of milkshake, and I use the term milkshake loosely because it's so thick it's literally ice cream in a cup. Of course they've got the basics like chocolate and vanilla but wait! They've got heath bar, Snickers, Oreo and seasonal flavors such as watermelon and peach.\\n\\nI wanna give them four stars but they lost one because they've messed up my order more then a few times. So make sure you're checking your food before leaving.\\n\\nTwo thumbs up for this cheap, delicious, and filling meal!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Now known as a new name, I believe it was called \\\"Yo Fresh\\\".\\n\\nThe inside was kind of dirty and the fro yo machines were mostly broken. The smoothie was really sugary and not \\\"fresh\\\" like the name implies. \\n\\nMy hope is that they are brand new and working on fixing the place up.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: My wife and I ate here for the first time on 10/24/14, invited by our Turkish neighbor who tries to eat there once a week.  We agree with all of the positive reviews and comments already listed here.  Food was very fresh and delicious.  We had the combo kabobs of beef and chicken skewers and they were outstanding.  Even the french fries were excellent.  Service was good and attentive.  We will definitely be returning in the near future.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This place just opened so a lot of items on their menu aren't up yet. However if you're a fan of El Pulgarcito de America this is owned by the same people (and within walking distance of the other restaurant, just on the other side of Ben Thanh). You will recognize some of the menu items from El Pulgarcito, though when we went they did not have several things on the menu yet because of the recent opening.\\n\\nLike El Pulgarcito, our server had minimal English. Fortunately I speak Spanish fluently so this was not a problem for me. The parking situation is definitely better than El Pulgarcito, too. \\n\\nWhat I had isn't exactly on the menu - it's just the regular breakfast, but they were happy to serve the eggs Ranchero style with salsa verde upon request. The eggs were cooked perfectly, over easy with a runny yolk. The salsa verde was wonderful (a tiny bit spicier than the green sauce at El Pulgarcito). The nice thick Mexican crema went perfectly too, scooping up a little crema for each bite of egg. The steak was well-done, but tender and simply (but perfectly) seasoned. The refried beans come on the side and had a wonderful flavor as well. The tortillas served on the side were thick, like they are at El Pulgarcito, but the crispy tortillas under the eggs were nice and thin. I think this breakfast is, overall, a touch better than El Pulgarcito - which is really saying something.\\n\\nThe 4 stars is both high in anticipation of the quality and goodness at El Pulgarcito (just Mexican), and not yet 5 stars since my first 2 requests weren't available yet even though they were on the menu. So this rating may change after a few visits.\\n\\nI did snag one of the little take out menus (from my last visit to El Pulgarcito, actually) so I'll scan that and add soon.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Where do I even start with this one...\\n\\nFirst off, let me say that the staff was friendly and welcoming.  And that was where the positive experience ended.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I stopped in here on a Saturday on the way to a friend's house because we were looking for a quick bite and this place had good reviews.  I love good frybread so I was excited to see what this place had to offer.  I was sadly disappointed.\\n\\nI tried the Dev's chicken dish and my girlfriend tried another dish that I can't recall the name of.  I really can't believe that what came out was the standard that this place goes by.  The frybread itself wasn't bad but was pretty bland.  The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.\\n\\nShortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.\\n\\nPlease understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.  It tasted like drinking cantaloupe juice.\\n\\nIf you are a frybread company then you should at least do the frybread really well and then build on top of that.  This place just didn't have it together I'm afraid.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: this place is a little weird, i gotta say. i've been to the others and very much enjoyed my meals/cocktails. this location is just ok. we've now been 3 times. sushi prices are pretty high, but the sushi was good on all 3 occasions so i'll tolerate the prices. there's no happy hour, which is a disappointment but there are drink specials during certain televised sports games - the specials end once the game ends.  \\n\\nthe design of the restaurant is awkward, with 2 booths back to back across from the bar and completely separate from the rest of the restaurant. the ceiling is high and the restaurant gets very, very loud on a saturday night. the saturday night we visited we stopped at the bar for a drink while we waited for our table and the bartender greeted our party of 4 with \\\"i need your IDs if you're going to sit here\\\". we of course provided them, but given that this is a service establishment a kinder and friendlier greeting (\\\"Hi, how are you?\\\") would have been appreciated, followed by a respectful request for our IDs.\\n\\nthere are a lot of tables, but there is definitely room for more. the restaurant would benefit from a professional designer. our teppan chef was less than entertaining and the teppan prices are a bit high for the area and the quality. i would say the teppan was average, as was the entire experience on all 3 days. one other note: the beers on display on the shelf behind the bar aren't necessarily available. some are \\\"decor\\\" and not available for purchase, a major disappointment. don't show it to me if i can't have it!\\n\\ni'll return for the sushi, but i won't be dropping big bucks here.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Came here every morning for breakfast while staying at Mandalay Bay.

They also offer flavored cream cheese such as honey walnut, strawberry, veggie and blueberry. \\n\\nFruit cups are fresh and the fruit were sweet and crunchy everytime.

I ordered the combo banh mi with extra pate and a coffee to go.  The dining area is huge and there was quite a bit of people that day,  they effortlessly went through the line and I received my sandwich and coffee in less than 5 min.  We took it back to the hotel and I was impressed with the size and filling.  Not only was there a decent amount of meat for me, but quite a bit of pickled vegetables.  The crunch in the bread made polish off the entire sandwich(also just finishing working out helped).  The coffee was sweet and served as a dessert.  Looking forward to coming back.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Worst dry cleaner ever, signed up for yelp just for this review! The ruined my wedding dress!!!

It was the first day of our honeymoon and we were hungry and didn't want to spend much, so we ventured into Red, White and Blue. \\n\\nWe were seated and the service was...okay. For as busy as the place was (it wasn't) I expected more than the slow service we got. Also, servers were huddled behind our table chatting with the bartenders which was pretty annoying. \\n\\nWe both had burgers which were good, but anywhere else would have cost us a third less than what we were charged. We ended up spending over $50 with tip for me and my husband, which was waaaaay more than we should have paid. \\n\\nWe left there saying that we should have checked the Yelp reviews and sure enough, when we returned to our room, we saw that we should have avoided the place!\\n\\nIf you're starving and staying at Mandalay and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, walk over to Luxor's buffet. It's still not going to be the best meal of your life, but it's cheaper and has more to offer than Mandalay's.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Very impressed. \\n\\nEven though I've only been practicing for 3 years I have been exposed to a good variety of teachers and studios across 3 states. I'm no pro and I still have a lot to learn, but yoga is important to me and I'm experienced enough to write a review. It is the studio in Las Vegas that I prefer over the others because they have a lot of impressive talent and some classes that you can't find at any other studio in Las Vegas.\\n\\nI recently tried a Mysore class - I thought anything that makes you sore is probably a good workout. I had no idea it was an Asthanga practice group doing a set sequence and not a traditional class that is led by an instructor at the front of the room. Wow it was awesome! The teacher's name is Jennifer and she helped me understand the difference between Mysore and led classes - and the difference with a set sequence of poses. She gave me the attention I needed and started teaching me to memorize the sequence. Most of the poses I had done in flow classes, but Jennifer showed me the way they are supposed to be done and it made me work a lot harder and therefore the benefit to my body has been tremendous! \\n\\nAsthanga Mysore is harder than most of the classes I have attended anywhere, and it really challenges my mind and body. I forget some poses or get them out of order and Jennifer always reminds me and helps me in a way that makes me feel like I belong with people that blow my mind with what they can do in their practice. \\n\\nAs hard as it is for me to make the classes with my work schedule I have made it a top priority to go as much as I can. I would go every day if I could. Thanks Jennifer for being so knowledgable and providing rationale for everything you tell me that actually makes perfect sense! (Im the one who keeps forgetting the closing sequence that you're very patient with).\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I tried this place at the recommendation of a friend who went here a couple of weeks ago. I'm glad I did. We came here during a day trip to Madison for my fianc\\u00e9e's birthday/doctor's appointment/trip to pick up a turtle we're babysitting. It made a suitable birthday meal.\\n\\nThe regular buffet items were probably the best I've had at any Asian buffet I've been to. Everything seemed fresh and the options I chose were outstanding compared to other buffets I've been to. My only complaint is that the fried rice was a bit bland, but it's meant to be mixed in with the other foods so that's a minor gripe.\\n\\nMy stomach was a little bit uneasy all day (unrelated to and preceding coming here, totally not anything to do with the restaurant) so I took it easy on the sushi. The few pieces I had were good, although they weren't, in my opinion, on the same level as the rest of the food. For sushi, I'm definitely still more partial to Fushimi/Fushinami on Milwaukee's east side. That said, the sushi is endless and you're free to take as much or as little as you like. Too often with sushi buffets you're locked into a whole maki roll only to discover its not quite your thing; here, that's not going to happen. The sushi area seemed sanitary, and two guys were making the rolls fresh as I browsed.\\n\\nThe service was pretty friendly for a buffet. Often, at a buffet I feel like I'm being watched by the staff; here, it felt like the staff was present but not like I was being stared down. The woman waiting on us was attentive about clearing plates and bringing drink refills.\\n\\nFinally, the price: we did the lunch buffet. Honestly, for all-you-can-eat sushi...you really can't beat this price. $8.XX per person, plus a bit for the drinks. That's just unheard-of.\\n\\nEasily a 4/5. I plan to come back on some future trip to Madison, and I could easily see bumping it up to a 5/5.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Got there on a Tues night 10:30 pm no valet parking, long check-in line, employees standing around joking.

Booked Crowne Plaza on about 6 days' notice when just about every other hotel in the downtown area was no longer offering their military rate for the dates of my trip. They have free wireless, but no free breakfast.\\n\\nWe had a nice stay. We got a room with a king size bed and balcony. The balcony was nice--not a view of downtown, but still a nice enough view of part of the city. The room was pretty clean, but there was an overly deodorized smell (that went away once I left the sliding door to the balcony open for a while, since it was a nice day). Some of the curtains, the bedskirt, and the comforter had a few little stains, but nothing worth complaining over. The bathroom was very nice, with a nice shower head, but I was a little disappointed there was no fan. The TV was an old CRT 28 or 32\\\" that was clearly on its last legs, but that was OK too since we were there to sleep not watch TV.\\n\\nThe location is pretty good--in the government district across the street from the huge county courthouse. Seemed like a nice safe area--the manager even recommended a safe jogging route in the area that began and ended at the hotel. The walk to the shops and restaurants of downtown is at least 10-15 minutes, which wasn't bad, but they also have a free shuttle that takes you up to 3 miles from the hotel, which covers all of the downtown area.\\n\\nOverall, we had a pleasant stay. Nothing to write home about (except the nice balcony), but nothing to complain about either.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: As a successful business owner and woman, I was so excited to treat myself to a wonderful dinner here.

{"prompt": "Sentence: Just stayed in a spa room at New York New York for 3 days. The giant jacuzzi tub in the room was awesome. The price of the room was incredible as well. The only downside? The wifi was terrible. TERRIBLE. To have it included in the daily \\\"resort fee\\\" was just insulting.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Given that this restaurant was 1/4 full on one of the busiest weekends (July 4) should have been a warning sign. We made reservations for 6:45 PM and were seated next to a table of 20 people with screaming kids (I am as mad with myself for not asking for another table as I am with the airhead hostess for seating us there). Given that there were more employees at the restaurant than patrons, I don't understand why the service was so poor. \\n\\nWhen we sat down they did the usual up-sell on bottled water (attention all restaurants -- this is getting ANNOYING) and we asked for \\\"tap water\\\" and I ordered a prickly pear frozen Margarita no salt. What arrived was a Margarita WITH salt. Given there was straw I went ahead and started drinking it, but within 60 seconds the waiter came to prepare the \\\"table side guacamole\\\" and he asked me if I liked the drink and I said it was OK but they went ahead and put salt on it. His response? \\\"OK\\\" ... note to management, when either your bartender or waitstaff screw up should they not try to make amends? \\n\\nGiven that I've had \\\"table side guacamole\\\" at much cheaper places, like El Torito Grill, I expected something more than bringing a bowl with all the ingredients and the waiter standing there mixing them --- no explanation of WHAT the ingredients were or if we wanted this or that in the guacamole --- so why say \\\"table side\\\" when it might as well have been done in the kitchen? And to top it off I had to ask the waiter about the two hot sauces; e.g. what were they, were they hot or mild, etc. The guacamole was OK, not the best and it was EXTREMELY salty. My guest and I couldn't figure out why. \\n\\nMy guest ordered the Filet with Cheese enchiladas and I ordered the \\\"tres tacos\\\". My tacos were probably an appetizer but I wasn't that hungry and quite honestly nothing on the menu looked that great. They also had an all-you-can-eat buffet for $29 but to my guest and myself it looked like a glorified taco bar (with a nasty looking roasted whole suckling pig in the middle -- I'm sorry, when I see something that could possibly be someones pet roasted whole on a platter it doesn't make my mouth water). \\n\\nMy three tacos were one pork which was so hot I had to take a Pepcid AC after the meal, a chicken taco that was quite good and a steak carnitas taco that was smothered in the sweetest tasting BBQ sauce I've ever had --- that one I skipped after the first bite. \\n\\nIn the meantime, table with all the brats (why do parents allow this?) kept getting louder, my guest's steak and enchiladas came. He ordered the steak medium rare and what came was somewhere between medium well and well done. The waiter was actually standing behind me when I saw my guest cut the steak in half and looked in shock at how well done it was. Before I could say \\\"send it back NOW\\\" the waiter said, ohh, that looks well done to me. So he took it back but offered NOTHING given that I was done with my meal by the time the next steak came which was BLOODY RARE. My guest and I had headaches from the screaming children and just wanted to get the hell out of there so he ate most of the steak but left the most bloody rare pieces for the kitchen staff to see when the plates were returned to the kitchen. We waited forever for the check and the waiter didn't take anything off the bill or even offer a free desert. I left a 10% tip and will NEVER be back.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: We came here on a Friday about 4:30pm and there was no line!! I paid around $130.00 for 2 people because I figured it would be the same price as a steakhouse. (I found out later that the buffett was a bit more) If you are looking for steak you will disappointed like I was. I assumed that steak would be an option because of the pricing of the buffett but I was wrong. They had other choices like lamb, prime rib and chicken. You can get most of these choices at other buffets for much cheaper. \\n\\nI skipped over to the seafood which had Alaskan crab legs and rock crab claws. The Alaskan crab legs you can get at most Las Vegad buffets but the rock crab claws I haven't seen. The reason why I was dissatisfied is because they don't have crab claw crackers. I was told they had wooden mallots but I didn't want to go in that direction because we were seated too close to the other table. I didn't want to have crab shells flying all over the place so I just had the crab legs.\\n\\nI checked out the Asian station but I didn't find anything special. It was comparable to the Rampart Casino Buffett ( which isn't saying much). The dessert bar had no real stand out items for me.  They had gelato and an assortment of pastries. They do have fresh juices though but I didn't try any of them. \\n\\nIt is a good buffet but it is overpriced for what it is. If you must try it to see for yourself then you should go but if there is a long line I would think twice.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Go glad to find Randy and this company!

Not that I crave a crowded and noisy dining experience, but it would've been nice to think we'd made the right choice eating there by seeing other diners voting with their wallets.\\n\\nI don't think our waitress spoke any English beyond what was on the menu. She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.\\n\\nThe food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken. It lacked spice and came loaded with onions (which I had asked them to leave out).\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place means business, strong smell of roasted coffee in the air, people eating late night snacks, a great selection of anything java or non java to tempt your senses!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This review is for NEW YEARS EVE ONLY!!\\n!. My girlfriend and I had an 8:30 reservation and when we arrived there was a line out in front of the door. They were NOT ready for the 2nd seating and took almost 20 minutes to finally start getting everyone in and to their tables. \\n2. I ordered a very EXPENSIVE bottle of champagne and you would have thought the waiter would have taken care of us, but he pretty much ignored us. After he poured our champagne, he placed the champagne on the piano where ANYONE could have just poured themselves champagne from OUR BOTTLE. I had to ask him to get an ice bucket and move it NEXT to our table!!\\n3. The waiter took our order for appetizers  which was about 6 different options and he would bring them to us with sauces. He brought back our \\\"order\\\" but had lobster claws and only a couple of stone crab claws. I asked for what we ordered and he went back to get more. He came back with only 4 and said this was ALL they had they were out. OUT after only 30 minutes into service!!??\\n4. We ordered a Caesar Salad for 2 and when they brought it we tried it and you could tell it was pre prepared as the lettuce was soggy and the salad was over dressed!\\n5 Dinner came and at least our steaks came out great.\\n6. The waiter brought us dessert (no choice on this huh?) and they were from a crappy pre prepared bakery complete with the paper on the bottom of both desserts. Both un edible. \\n7. This was by reservation ONLY, so for you to be so totally UNPREPARED on service, food etc is inexcusable!! For the prices you charge, you should be ashamed!\\n8. I have traveled around the world to some of the finest restaurants in major European cities and they know how to take care of their customers where you want to come back. Dominick's is arrogant and thinks they are the be all, end all. Guess what, you're NOT all that!! Restaurants are driven by customers and how you treat your customers will determine how well you will do. Unless you FIX your problems, not only will you fail for next New Years, but I can't see you being in business for long. In this economy restaurants are NOT a necessity and people will go where they are taken care of, as well as for the food. You're NOT cutting it with your customer service and for your sake, you need to take a good long look at how you're mistreating customers and change it. If not, you'll be another asterisk of \\\"and this was where Dominick's USED to be!!\\\"\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: C'est bien mais les toillettes...\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Really like this mall!

I love how great it looks from outside and the water show is fun to watch table side if you're dining in one of their many renowned restaurants. The rooms aren't that amazing in my opinion but everything is definitely high quality. Their pool is huge and looks great on a sunny day. They offer any type of gambling you may be searching for and have an endless choice in food, from buffets to restaurants.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I used to love this swim school, and both my kids attended for several years. The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy \\\"training\\\" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn't take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.\\n\\nAs a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children's safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children's lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area). Eww. \\n\\nThe front desk staff is hit or miss. Some of them are super sweet and accommodating and some are rude and standoffish. As though they are better than you. Interesting. I've overheard them gossiping about their colleagues and other friends and even clients! Talking sh*t about your clients - and their kids - is not the best idea and is certainly unprofessional. I could go into more details but I think you get the point. \\n\\nMoral of the story is - I would have recommended years ago hands down. Today I would caution to stay away.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I was referred here by my cousin who ranted and raved about how amazing Dr. Gondi is.  I reviewed her credetials and bio, I was impressed and she sounded exactly what I've been looking for: http://www.lasvegasobgyncenter.com/about.html\\n\\nThat's who I tried to get in to see, however, since she's so awesome she's booked waaaaaaaaaaay far into the distant galaxy.  I settled for Dr. MIchaels, I figured that since she was in the same office that she must be awesome too. Well, my experience was sub-par. She talked sooooooooooooooo flippin' fast, English is my first language, I'm not slow & I consider myself above average intelligence in regard to the human anatomy and lady parts. I was boggled by what the eff she was saying to me.  I couldn't understand her, not because she spoke another langauge, but because she rattled off letters and sounds I asked her on mulitple occasions to repeat herself, she did and I still left feeling confused. I did my own research and now I understand, but seriously dude, really?\\n\\nThe check-in nurse told me she didn't have any other appointments for the day and this chick still made me wait 45 minutes. \\n\\nI will DEFINITELY WAIT to see Dr. Gondi next time and make my yearly appointment a year in advance.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: No joke, the absolute best if you have a modified off-road truck.\\n\\nI have a mildly modified Toyota Tacoma and they have been my go-to shop since day one.\\n\\nI've had some repair work done at the dealership since I'm still under warranty, but even then I've had to bring it to Desert Rat to really get things sorted out.  The level of expertise and attention to detail surpasses any other shop that I've been to in the Valley.\\n\\nMost of the guys have owned and still own Toyotas so you know they are experts in that category.\\n\\nMost recent experience involved a knocking noise that couldn't be resolved.  I've been running around the Valley having the truck looked at by several shops to no avail.  Desert Rat figured out the problem within 10 minutes and fixed it in 5.  It was so simple they didn't even charge me.  THAT is beyond good customer service.\\n\\nI cannot recommend them highly enough.  Ask for Chris or Brett.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We ordered takeout for lunch for the office. I ordered a patty melt with pepper Jack cheese and sourdough bread. It was pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with the fries or onion rings. Fries were soggy and onion rings were the kind when you bite into it the onion easily comes out.  Not impressed. \\n\\nOne co-worker ordered a bacon cheese burger and cheese fries. She had ordered the cheese fries before and it had originally had cheese sauce over the fries. This time it just had melted cheddar over the top and they were definitely not as good. Consistency is very important as if she had known it was just going to be melted cheddar she wouldn't have ordered them.  Her burger was pretty good and it was very big.  \\n\\nThe next co-worker ordered a chicken Philly sandwich and it was terrible. All bread and grilled onions. The chicken had no flavor and did not look like all white meat. She cut each bread slice in half and had enough bread/onions to make a complete other sandwich. She was really disappointed that it was so terrible. She took a few bites but she couldn't even finish it. \\nAnother co-worker ordered the BLT and fries.  The BLT was good but the fries were too soggy again.\\n\\nAll in all this place is ok for burgers/patty melts/BLT but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. Becuase you can find a better burger for cheaper at a wide variety of other places. \\n\\nMost importantly I expect consistency when I go to a place. It's so frustrating to order something and get it one way one time and a different way the next.\\n\\nEven with the limited choices that we have for lunch near the office I doubt we'll be back.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: If you can afford to, I recommend you stay at the Caesars; they've really got this whole Vegas luxury and no need to leave the property thing down. \\n\\nI was set up here for a few days while attending a trade show.

Sure you walk a mile every day if you go from end to end, but who cares. You can shop without going outside, eat varying cuisines at the buffet or at their other restaurants or you can people watch at the casino. \\n\\nHaving stayed at other hotels on the strip I'd really like to be able to come back here again, but like I said, it's a matter of affording it. Caesars = serious dough!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: One of the world worst casinos ever!\\nFirst off, the Buffet was horrid! \\nWe wouldn't even eat there!\\n\\\"I'll have some of the yeller!\\\"\\nThen we ordered something to eat from the restaurant and OMG!  We ordered Bisquits and Gravy and when my husband got to the room...we thought it was joke!  All the \\\"gravy\\\" leaked all over!  So he had to take it back and then when then wouldn't refund it they gave us another one! And it as gross!  We didn't eat it all and had to take it to the trash out the hall.\\nThen, I got locked out of my room and although they made a copy of my ID...they wouldn't let me in because I didn't have my license!  The had me so mad I finally told them I'm calling the cops AND I just freaking on a stroke two weeks ago!  I was not happy!  Make it to my room (hellish version of The Shining) with Security and had to show them my ID.\\n2 towels and 1 shampoo....that's it!  \\nOH!  Also the freakin' pool closing at 8pm!  JEESH!  It's still 100 degrees here at 8pm!\\nOne more thing:  you only get like 10 channels and 3 of them of ESPN!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: We were fortunate to be able to grab a table for 5 of us for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  We opted to try something with cherries on it (pancake with cherries) but really, there wasn't anything particularly special about the cherries.  It just taked like the cherry pie preserves from a jar.\\n\\nOtherwise, food was just fine.  Sausage links were odd in the sense that they were skinny.  A decently priced ($6-7 per meal) breakfast option in downtown Pittsburgh.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Water, Water, Water-loo, loo, loo!!!!!\\n\\nMy how you have changed from my \\\"studious\\\" days as a WLU undergrad. The fine dining landscape has certainly improved in little over 4 years (or 5...my oh my I'm ageing at a rapid rate). However, with age comes an appreciation for the finer things in life such as good food, good wine, good company, etc. So I guess this is why my overall experience at The Bauer Kitchen was so amazing!\\n\\nThis place impressed me from the moment we walked in. The d\\u00e9cor was beautifully elegant while maintaining a certain rugged appeal. Dark stained wood tables paired with Ostrich skin covered seats made for a unique combination going with the overall stylish and sophisticated ambience. But don't be scared off by my description, you don't need to wear a members jacket to dine here. The Bauer is still trendy enough for jeans and a t-shirt. Lets call it casual fine dining\\n\\nThe menu was a welcome surprise as well. Catering to every taste it was very eclectic. The one thing I liked best is while maintaining certain fine dining staples, the Bauer had found was at making simple foods such as Pizza and Burgers, just this side of classy, using premium ingredients and cooking process. Yumm!\\n\\nI decided to start my meal with a pint of Mill Street Organic (always a automatic +1 star for any establishment who carries my fav beer on tap). \\n\\nFor my appetizer I had what was referred to as a Romaine salad. It was like a Caesar salad BUT with a freshly made garlic dressing, fresh croutons AND the best part being the slow cooked smoked strips of bacon which tasted the way a camp-fire smells. ..... Just drooled in my mouth a little (sorry)\\n\\nMoving on, for my main course I decided to call this restaurant out on the fine portion of their \\\"fine dining\\\" claim, and ordered their Duck Confit. I asked the waiter for his honest opinion of the dish and he said it was wildly popular and told me to it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. SOLD GAR\\u00c7ON!!\\n\\nThe duck was served exactly as promised, deliciously crispy and moist. It was served with mixed veggies, steamed and grilled, and fingerling potatoes seasoned and cooked to soft perfection.\\n\\nAll of my waiters recommendations were spot on for dinner and his service was impeccable. He even made a great after dinner shot suggestion when we asked for tequila. For any of you who have never tried Cabo Wabo tequila, do it! Perfect after dinner shot to help you digest (or make you forget you are full), smooth and actually tasty :)\\n\\nThis experience came with an expected price tag of about $60-70 per person, which I can justify for fine dining. However, if you are looking for a cheap meal I recommend you try one of the other fine establishments on King St. But if you have the extra bucks, hit The Bauer Kitchen up, well worth it.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I was really excited to try this restaurant for breakfast, but I walked away disappointed. It's mediocre (at best) food. From the orange drink to potatoes that come from a box (I saw the box in the kitchen), this place has disappointment written all over it. While it's super cheap, I'd skip Lindos and instead head to your closest Eat n' Park.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: To it's menu, vibe, and intense decor, this place is all about beef. Suggest not coming here if you are a vegetarian. Despite this joint's, perhaps overly passionate cow obsession, kyloe served me one of the best steaks I've ever had. It's not a place to come to if you are starving and want a huge chunk of meat, but it is a wonderfully tasty dinner filled with various flavors as there is a variety of cuts, rubs, marinades, and sides to choose from. Although our meal was a wee bit pricy, the food did, by no means disappoint, and I'm proud to say my short horn sirloin was awesome. Suggest coming here if you are visiting Edinburgh.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Front of the house doesn't have a clue.  Walked out on my second visit, room wasn't half full, waited 15 minutes for water.  Back of the house so-so at best.  Marsala must come out of a jar, seriously.  French dip just okay.  Less than a mile away, Bernard's Bistro & Luna Rosa are most excellent!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I definitely enjoyed the shepherds pie poutine and thought MAN, why have I never eaten this before, or cooked it every brutal Montreal winter of my life? I also loved the smoked meat poutine and discovered that mustard is a more friendly flavour than I had previously recognized.  The young couple from Trois Rivere behind this new poutinerie on the hallowed ground of the old Roi Du Plateau are holding their own, and they seem super sweet and hard-working and I wish them the best. \\n\\nThe interior is a little cold and clinical feeling, but is very clean. The mayo options for the onion rings got me excited but then I didn't love them, or at least not with the heavy (and possibly artificial) citrus flavouring on the rings. The chop poutine is apparently popular but I am squeemish about chicken in fast food contexts and the texture on this one didn't do it for me - felt either processed or slightly undercooked for my liking. \\n\\nThe joint is new and super well intentioned and there are some excellent nosh options on the menu, especially for late nights. Marie-Pier's idea that they get a BYO license is genius, this would have me coming back with various beers all the time to cuddle up with a big red bowl of the shepherds pie. Also, I heard they are getting couches - smooth moves. I think some comf, some softer light, and a focus on high quality ingredients (even if it means slightly narrowing the vast menu) will help this Trois Rivere import thrive here in Montreal. Le Roi est mort. Vive le Roi.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Love this place.  Great staff and can always find a good conversation if you hang around to enjoy your purchase.  Everyone I've met there goes out of their way to be inclusive and welcome, which is pretty unique as far as I've experienced.\\n\\nThe one occasion I've had a less than stellar purchase, Nikki went out of his way to make things right.  That, as well as their great selection has earned them a regular customer.\\n\\nThe parking is a bit spotty at the moment, but should be better in a few weeks (I recommend parking in the north lot off Camelback until November).  Pretty good eats nearby as well, and good places to grab some snacks or beverages before heading to enjoy a good smoke.\\n\\nCan't recommend Baxter's enough!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: it really depends on whos working, when the older ppl are its better. All I know is I was really disturbed by the blond girl making our food who had a shirt 3 sizes to small so her stomach was showing (is the mandatory now a days?) I dont know if maybe the teen boy she was talking to who was sitting behind me at the table while i was standing in front of her ordering had spooged on her stomach last night? And ya she was like \\\"I'll text u later\\\", I almost thought she was talking to me but in fact she was looking thru me talking to him. AND YES, THEY ARE NOT OPEN 24 HOURS ANY LONGER which is a shame, but lets face it, this area is dead.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Just like any Starbuck's.  This one has a drive through but I don't use it.\\n\\nGood wifi.  Good drinks.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This restaurant is a nightmare! Ordered 2 appetizers, both were so small it was a joke! (plus expensive) I ordered a steak, it came out raw, I had to send it back, then it came back charred to death. Waitress was rude, it was a complete waste of $$.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Bigham Tavern is a great neighborhood bar.  It's a little divey but not like its predecessor, Kaib's.  It's a great place fo karaoke (but they got rid of it - we hope they bring it back), to watch a game, or to get some wings.  \\n\\nThe wings are probably the highlight of the menu.  Bigham has at least 20 different flavors of chicken wings.  The wings are always very nicely done, and are of decent size.  I've never experienced them overcooked or poorly done.  They're definitely some of the best wings I've ever had in Pittsburgh!\\n\\nI recently also had a Pittsburgh salad (minus the fries) with grilled chicken - the restaurant offers that you can get any of your toppings (chicken, steak, et al.) tossed in any of their numerous wing sauces.  I ordered the grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and it was really tasty.  The chicken was nicely done, it was tender and juicy and falling apart.  The rest of salad was comprised of very fresh ingredients.  \\n\\nThe only reason I'm not giving Bigham 4 stars - because the food is pretty good for a divey bar - is because their service is pretty inconsistent.  Some nights it's kind of poor and other nights it's good!  It's a mixed bag.  Basically, it is one of my favorite neighborhood spots and offers people a nice change from Shiloh Grill and Redbeard's.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Sunbum here with Jill eating the sea urchin.

You need to share the experience!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We sought this place out because of the high rating on Yelp and were dissapointed. The pork is chopped extremely fine (maybe by a food processor?) not pulled pork by any means. My husband and I both thought the potato salad tasted like it had to be store bought and the baked beans tasted like canned beans with ketchup added. We smoke at home and have had lots of great bbq and this was okay but we felt led astray by the high star rating on Yelp. We wouldn't go back.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Taylor is a stellar employee who I witnessed getting verbally abused by an arrogant pompous manager.  This manager working\\nNew Year's Eve should be fired.  Taylor did a stellar job considering it was New Year's Eve but was being cursed and ridiculed openly, 5-10 feet from customers.\\n\\nThe food was good, but the harassment I witnessed was despicable and there is no place for such a travesty, at any work facility.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: If you stay here, make sure you stay away from the GeoHoliday people on the 2nd floor! They will try and scam you and get you to sign a 45yr agreement (think about how long 45 yrs is). You will lose thousands of $$$ on a horrible service that you will probably never be able to use. There sales people are liars and will say anything to get you to sign, but any promises they say mean nothing as their contracts say that any oral agreement or representation is not valid.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: J'ai test\\u00e9 cet endroit trois fois, une fois pour le brunch, pour un verre et enfin pour le souper. \\nLe brunch \\u00e9tait bon mais pas beaucoup de choix pour les v\\u00e9g\\u00e9tariens.

If you are not a Geek, you won't understand why I gave five stars for this review.\\n\\nAt your first time, you won't be sure of your choice. The external door will lead you into a basement, but this is where the experience begins: on the left, you'll see custom arcades done with Xbox consoles. Yes, that means you can take your preferred drink, and play some Xbox games... with joysticks.\\n\\nOn the right side, the tables, sofas, and chairs. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evening, you'll see a lot of people playing board games on these. They are also computers friendly, as you can go there, and work for a couple of hours with a free Wifi connection that work (non usual for coffee shop, but they understand the importance of this for us, the Geeks), and enough power outlets.\\n\\nThey have a lot of choices for drinks: coffees, bubble teas, soft drinks, beers... They also have some snacks like hot dogs, nachos, peanut butter dumpling, desserts, and more. You'll also like the Geeky decorations: picture frames of Star Wars, Futurama, and much more.\\n\\nLet me finish this review by talking about the two owners: you can always see one of them in the place. They are so friendly, and they really care about their customers. They are also big fans of helping the promotion of the Geek culture.\\n\\nSo at the end, a very nice venue to hang out with friends, work on your computer, play board games, challenge your friend with Xbox games, or just sit down, and relax in a Geeky environment. The numbers of regulars will attest the experience you can get at Fonzoo.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Food was so-so. Carne Asada burrito I ordered came with beans which I wasn't expecting. I would suggest Filibertos over this place. You won't have to wait for your food for 30 minutes like I did and the food will probably be leaps and bounds better.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Convenient location (closest intersection: Jones and Spring Mountain). 1 ATM in the front, possibly 2 in the drive thru area in the back (never used before).\\n\\nThe one time I had to go in to deposit a check and pull out extra cash for rent, the line was not too long and moved quickly (think it was a Wednesday around noon) . Staff was pleasant to interact with, just the way they were trained to do by corporate or the branch manager.\\n\\nPlenty of parking spaces whenever I am here.  So I would say this is a good branch for customers that mainly utilizes ATM to conduct their WF transactions, with the occasional in-branch visit.\\n\\nGetting out of the parking lot to head North on Jones can be a pain, if you are there during peak traffic hours.  In which case try to use the center turning lane, and Frogger your way over as needed. Just be careful of north-bound vehicles that want to turn left onto Spring Mountain Rd.  Don't want no real life Game Over head on collision or hassles with insurance companies and Five-Os.\\n\\n4 stars.\\n\\nBe safe!

She told my friend to be a big bioy and eat up they didn't have doggy bags. Then she walked away. \\nHe was very disapointed and got up and walked out. I had to get another waiter to get the waitress for me. She said oh I though I was doing a good job. UM really how?\\n\\nThis experience has ruined it for me. I will not be back.

{"prompt": "Sentence: Nitaya's food is still only okay by way of Thai food, but the service is amazing.  So much so, that ti deserves a five star.  The server there, a funny, thoughtful guy in his 20's (whose name I've forgotten--dang!)\\n\\nI showed up here yet again with Nicolle and Carol and even though Nicolle had a problem with her dish, he was kind, friendly and very cool about returning the dish for another.  He also managed to keep thte table constantly full of water or any other food items, which was fantastic.  The best part, however?\\n\\nHe made a reference to \\\"Pedagogy of teh Oppressed.\\\"  Any waiter at a Thai restaurant who can cite the brilliance that is author Paolo Friere, deserves to have his restaurant kicked up a notch.  Fantastic.\\n\\nNow, can we make the food a bit more exciting next time?\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Food is authentic but hit or miss with the flavor. Staff are friendly and I can tell they are working very hard. I went there with a couple friend's and their friends on the day classes were cancelled due to rain, and I sincerely apologize for their behavior. At one point one of them yelled across the restaurant at the cooks saying he wanted ice cream, (oh my goodness, I am so sorry, that was very embarrassing)... I saw them advertising seafood pancakes last time I was there and plan to go back to try it since I really like seafood pancakes.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The bean dip was good.  That was it.  Everything else was just bad.  To be fair we showed up for an early dinner, 4pm on a Saturday, which is pretty much the worst time you can go to a restaurant.\\n\\nThe service was slow, but I expected that due to the time we arrived.  What I did not expect was way overcooked tamales, cheese enchiladas that were somehow actually bad.  Beef tacos that were inedible.\\n\\nMy shredded beef enchilada was decent.  I know this is not supposed to be super amazing Mexican food.  It is supposed to be OK americanized and somewhat boring mexican food.  After we left, I told my wife that half way through the meal, I wondered if I was going to get food poisoning.  She remarked that she had thought the same thing.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Stopped in here for a quick drink before a show.  The hostess was very nice and the place was kind of empty, so I was able to get a seat at the bar.  The bar was nice and clean and seated a decent amount.  They have a lot of beers on tap, a lot !!\\nI got my standard Gin Martini, which was very good and under $10.00.  Not bad for a place in the Theater District.  \\nNot sure how the service would be if the place was hopping but for me, on a Sunday afternoon, I sat down and had a drink in less than 3 minutes.  \\nThe wait staff and bartenders were 20 somethings so I was privy to the trials and tribulations of a 20 somethings life, but... I found it amusing... kind of took me back to my 20's, well as far back as I can remember.  \\nI would go back again.  It was cozy and clean and they made a good drink.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: The patio at this Hooters is a nice, relaxed spot to throw back a few beers during the day. There is no shortage of televised sporting events or bright orange butts, so that doesn't leave a whole lot to complain about unless you happen to order food.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: What can I say about Groceria Italiana that hasn't already been said? \\nPLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION! The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away, I'd be here multiple times a week. \\nI stopped back to Groceria Italiana after a food tour in Bloomfield a few weeks ago to pick up a few things for dinner. I decided to purchase the special- sausage ravioli because the owner had informed us that everything is made in house. Even the suasage is ground and tested in house before putting into the ravioli. I also left with marinara sauce and pepperoni bread. \\nThe pepperoni bread was light, fluffy and delicious. \\nThe ravioli is easily the best ravioli I have ever had. Each little pocket of heaven was hand made and was slightly different in shape and size from each other. The tall tale sign that they were pressed by hand. We followed the directions on the box and BAKED (not boiled) them in sauce. I've literally thought about those ravioli every time I have had italian food since. If you are anywhere near this place, stop in immediately!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: i didnt like this place at first.  but as months passed by and i didnt wanna drive all the way to maryland parkway for some decent filipino food i gave it another shot.  and im glad i did, the food was fresh, especially the lechon kuwali, they cut it fresh right when you order it.\\n\\nand next time you go, order the pancit palabok.  best i've had. they use thin noodles which i love.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: ::::::\\n      ::::::\\n            ::::::      \\nWe looked at our entertainment book for pizza coupons and came across Domino's in some cruel twist of fate.  Since we hadn't had Domino's in easily 10 years and it was a pretty good coupon we decided in what later seemed a momentary lapse in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot.\\n\\nIt will likely be at least 10 years before we try them again.\\n\\nPizza that was on a par with those frozen ones from the grocery store and a free sandwich we shared that left us with tummy aches.\\n\\nDespite the coupon savings it's no deal for poor quality food.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Good beer and the lamb was great\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Like another reviewer here, I was very excited to try this place out. I travel to Phoenix several times a year and I always saw the place on my way to the rental car return. There are always lots of cars going through and while I waited for my order I noticed tons of cars rolling through. These are usually good signs for an eating establishment.\\n\\nImagine my disappointment when I realized that folks in Phoenix don't know what fish and chips are. I was expecting real fish and chips, not some odd square facsimile of fish. Fish filets are NOT square. If i had wanted this I could have just gone to Long J. Silvers or Captian D's. I'm not saying I'm a fish and chips aficionado but I've eaten fish and chips all over the country and this is NOT fish and chips. Go have some fish and chips in New England (anywhere in NE) and you'll find out what fish and chips should be.\\n\\n I'll admit that the sauce is good and if I had some real fish and chips to dip it in, I'd enjoy it even more. I can only chalk this up to a regional thing but I'll definitely give this place a pass the next time I'm in Phoenix.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: ER Nurse: \\\"So what happened\\\"?\\n#1 Son:   \\\"Dad took a header\\\".\\n\\nWhat actually happened was we went on a hike and #1 son tripped. Dad (that would be me) was following too closely, tripped over #1 son and dislocated two toes, broke one of them and got some nasty trail-rash on his left forearm. #1 son - a small scratch on his hand.  \\n\\nUnfortunately I came to the ER around the same time as a number of other people who were much worse off than I was.  While I didn't like waiting I was also happy that my injuries didn't warrant a higher place in line.  Everyone from the woman who checked me in, the admitting nurse, the ER nurses, the medical assistant, the xray tech, the PA who made my toes straight again and the doctor who popped in to say hi were very professional, caring and friendly.  They even went out of their way to amuse my two sons who were bored beyond tears.\\n\\nNot a good day but if it had to end in an ER, I'm glad it was this one.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Been here 3 times. I love the ambiance, the best. Like it better than Town Square,  its more cozy, stores are closer together, bettter place to walk during summer Vegas heat. I ate at Cafe Leone with my kids 4 times already and shopped at Charming Charlie 3 times. Im not tired of going to those places again and again. Most stores and restaurant are just pricy but quality.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This place is over hyped.  Every dish we ordered had barely anything on the plate. Lotus of siam, you disappoint me.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Yay, Sephora! So I can blow my budget not on liquor or gambling but on makeup! I also picked up a really great swim cover up from Bikini Bay. One of my friends got a pair of Steve Madden flats for $10 on clearance, so it wasn't a complete waste of a mall. I just wish there was a Nordstrom so I could buy my exclusive mascara, oh well. Those kiosk workers are super annoying and Nestle overwhelmingly smells like cookies when you walk by (that's how they get drunk people!) My favorite part is that we could walk partly through the air conditioning to get to other casinos instead of completely walking outside, it's a big deal when it's 110 out!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: While the company was awesome the food and service was far less memorable. The servers were uptight and stilted. The brunch fair was quite limited and while prepared with a chef's flare lacked that breakfasty feel you look for with brunch. Would not go back again for brunch.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This review is for dinner only.  I have yet to try brunch, but hopefully I'll be able to update this review in the near future with that information!\\n\\nThis is my go-to spot for a romatic dinner with the wife.  This place is perfect for anything romantic...from a first date, to a 50th anniversary dinner.  Its a place that truly transcends time and generational gaps, both in ambiance and style of cusine.  \\n\\nIn case you were confused by the last sentence above, I mean that the menu and amibance aren't trendy and contemporary enough to scare off grandma and grandpa, and yet not old-fashioned and stuck up enough to scare off the youngins!  It a perfect balance of old meets new.\\n\\nService here is prompt and unassuming.  I've never gone wanting for a thing at my table during the numerous visits I've made, and yet have never been bothered by a servers overbearing presence.  Another reason it's great for a quiet, romantic dinner.  If I want to be entertained by my server, I'll go to Ru Sans.  Those guys are friggin hilarious; just not conducive to a quiet dinner conversation.\\n\\nI highly recommend the Lemon Goat salad, and the Duck Breast with grapefruit reduction.  My wife can do a salad and crab cake appetizer here and be thoroughly full.  As for the \\\"smokey collards\\\" that comes with the crabcakes...my wife rarely gets to enjoy any, because I'm usually scraping them off her plate and onto mine before the server can set our plates down.  I'm a sucker for good ol' fashioned pork bone soaked collard greens, and this place does not disappoint.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: went last nite to see the great george jones... first stop the will call window for my tickets i gave the guy my credit card  and drivers lic. he handed me 2 tickets and off we went i new i had ordered a isle seat and down near the stage when we were pointed to our seats they were up from the stage and in the middle........i told one of the ushers and he summond a manager/head usher i told him the situation and he took my name and said he would be right back he returned a few minutes later with the right tickets and apoligized..........great service.........when we did get the right seats we were behind the band........ my wife said oh great were behind the band then he informed us the stage rotates........cool...........great show......great venue... highly recomended   ALSO HAVE THER OWN PARKING LOT VERY CONVIENT PARKING....IN AND OUT\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This place has changed over the years or do they not serve good food unless its the weekend.\\n\\nWe came on a Monday with a large group for dim sum. The shui Mai was ok. The dumplings were ok. The pork ribs were ok. The rice congee was ok. The steamed shrimp with rice noodles were day old that were warmed up with watered down soy sauce. It was gross. The chicken feet were cooked in a vinegar sauce and that was awful. The shrimp ball was old tasting too.\\n\\nThey use to be very good for dim sum but what happened? I feel bad but it must of been the case of the Monday's. lol. Don't think I will return for dim sim here. :(\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I must say I've heard a lot of raving reviews from my friends when it comes to sushi so i came here with high expectations.  I also took a lot of cues from my friends and ordered the \\\"screaming orgasm\\\" and a bowl of french onion soup. \\n\\nThe soup was wonderful, served in a clay pot with plenty of onions and cheese, but the screaming orgasm left me a bit underwhelmed, especially for the price.  Maybe I'm too new to the sushi scene to make a judgement, but I remember having a similar dish at Sushi Fever which was a lot better and for a lower price.\\n\\nIt's not to say I wouldn't try it again, but I would definitely order something else.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning (we had a craving for fast food breakfast) and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Great places, full of nice baristas\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Blessedly way off the Strip when you're in the mood for such things (um, frequently?), the biggest surprise is how uniformly excellent the beers are coming from a place whose name makes you think of frat boys brewing beer in water cooler bottles. A tasty IPA, a delicious roasty coffee hinting stout, a pale ale of near perfection, and no doubt everything they do is handled equally well. Runs a bit dark, and has a pleasant, friendly atmosphere that's a refreshing change from the general bleakness of the Chicago Brewing Company. Definitely worth a visit if you're up for hanging out and drinking good beer. And probably quite a few more visits after that. Cheers.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The place is closed, and out of business.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Good place to watch the game, have some bar eats and beers. Big patio with several TVs too. Went there recently to watch the Wisconsin game and after about 2 minutes we figured out the spot and the waitress was kind enough to change the the TV for us. Wasn't too busy, which was a nice change as some bars on game day just get ridiculously busy and it's hard to get good service. That said; it wasn't slow by all means, just a good crowd. \\n\\nOrdered the chicken nachos, which were OK. Came on separate tortilla chips with all the fixings. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but when I think of or want nachos, I want a stack of chips with the ingredients dumped on top, but that's just me. Had a bite of the wife's burger and it was good as well. Menu is full of special sandwiches and burgers as well as salads and apps. \\n\\nOnly negative was that the PBR was $2.50...now that's steep for a PBR, even knowing how much I love it.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Was there last night.  Pho was a 2.5 on a scale of 5.  I had the one that costs a little extra with meatballs, tripe, brisket. Generous amount of meat, but you know what they say, Pho is all about the broth.  That's what makes it.  Every pho is made from  beef broth even the chicken pho.  And that wouldn't be bad if the broth was flavorful. Da Vang's broth is a 5 out of 5 but I decided to compare.  I had the spicy, salty shrimp with shells on.  They were ok but I didn't realize I would be eating the shrimp's caca in the process.  My guest had beef with snow peas.  It was spiced to his liking but the flavor just wasn't there.  Their prices are incredibly low and that's why I gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one.  You get what you pay for.  Back to Da Vang for me!!!!!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Always clean, employees are always friendly. They sell everything from soda to hot dog buns to medicine.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Went for breakfast.  The firepit looks totally different in daytime.  Anyway, on to the eggs:  the biggest omelet I've ever seen.  And somehow they managed to make it taste delicious.  Great service.  Very affordable.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Took my wife and our 2 yr old to lunch today and it was horrible... I had the Chinese steak and she had the beef stew with rice, plus we ordered spicy duck tongue since it was on their chef special menu...\\n\\nBoth of our food were very salty, to the point that we were trying to scrap some of the sauces off so we can eat it.  The duck tongue, which was suppose to be spicy and hot, was barely warm(temperature wise) and had no flavor...  All I saw was a plate of bell peppers, onions, and maybe a couple of tongue in there.  This is a stir-fried dish, which should be coming out piping hot, and yet it was basically cold..\\n\\nWhen we got home later, let's just say their duck tongue won the battle and the war...\\n\\nCan we bring back the old Ah-Chung that used to be here? The decor might be worst but at least their food were edible\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I had really been looking forward to eating here and scheduled my birthday lunch here while we were in Vegas.\\n\\nThere were 4 of us and we were seated immediately for our 1pm reservation. I ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). My husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). I'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that I was going to order the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash. \\n\\nThe bread was really nice. I liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. It was spicy and yummy.\\n\\nWe ordered the queso fundido to start. It was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. YUMOLA!!!! This was delicious.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived and I cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. That's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. A solid white, runny yolk is the norm. The hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. They were clearly undercooked. My husband got the pork tenderloin sandwich and we were surprised to see it came cold.  I took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. Our 2 other companions enjoyed their Mesa Burgers.\\n\\nI sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. A manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. I cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  But the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  Why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? I can do it and I can't cook worth shite.  So, the manager came back to ask how it was and I told him I've been waiting months to come here and I'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. So he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. Nice, but not what I wanted for my birthday lunch.\\n\\nEven though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. We looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  Disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I've alway wanted to try this since my friend told me about it ever since it opened. She recommend me the hot frozen sundae. She said its supposed to be hot but it's cold because of the ice cream and the hot chocolate. She couldn't really describe it to me until I try it. \\n\\nSo now I took my friend here since it was her birthday. Our service was nice but I could have better service at Ihop. We ordered just the appetizers and the hot frozen sundae. Few minutes later he gave us our desserts before our food came. We ask him we wanted the desserts last after our meal. So he took it back. The place wasn't busy as I thought it would be. When our meal came. The nachos and the onion ring was good. As I said I could have better. When we were done with the meal, our desserts came and when we tried it. It wasn't hot as they describe it to be. It was very disappointment. After it was recommend. I won't wanna go back here again.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We have been living at the Verona property for almost a year.  The apartment is beautiful and the amenities make you feel like you are at a first class resort.  The pool, spa, and surrounding sunning area are in a magnificent setting.  There is a wonderful clubhouse and well equipped fitness center.  I would highly recommend this property.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: WARNING-strictly a happy hour review. I ordered the Alaskan rolls, Boston rolls, and the California rolls. Holy cow-SO GOOD! All of the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs gave us a ceviche dip, which was deliciously tangy and complimented the Boston rolls perfectly. I absolutely LOVED this restaurant's happy hour and I will definitely be back for the delicious food.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I clearly have a different opinion of this place compared to other reviews. this was my second visit here. the first being a few years ago. \\nI do not even know where to begin. \\nThe place is wall to wall people. So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4.\\nOur server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home. \\nThe food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden. The one shining star of the meal was the spinach and artichoke dip. it was one of the best I have ever had. \\nSave your money go elsewhere, where you can have a great meal and a nice conversation. \\nI for one will never go back.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Wow... I'm really torn about 3 or 4 stars because this is really a 3.5.  \\n\\nMy girl friend, her son and I were cravin' some Thai but reluctant to drive all the way into Vegas for our favorite joints so we ended up at Bangkok Orchid.  The restaurant was clean, service was nice and food was tasty so... what was the problem?  Well, the chicken in our dishes was a lil tough and when we ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai... though the flavor was great, there was literally only 2 shrimp on it.  With the 3 of us, that wasn't even 1 shrimp each.  Sheesh!  \\n\\nGarlic Chicken was tasty, Pad Thai was tasty and Black Pepper beef was good... loved their veggies.\\n\\nI'd go again but next time, if there's not more shrimp, it'll be mutany.\\n\\nMight see ya there.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Awesome concept, great location, terribly small and poorly laid out.\\n\\nThere are two halves of The District of so it would seem.  The Cheesecake Factory and Whole Foods side should be combined with the Williams Sonoma Kings Fish House side.  There is a major road between the two.  \\n\\nThe planning people in Northern Virginia should have been consulted on this project because Reston Town Center is awesome and this area would have done extremely well with a project like that. \\n\\nThis is OK and is home to some great restaurants so I will return.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Situated 5 minutes from my auntie's house, this \\\"local\\\" casino offers all the aspects of what you are looking for in a casino, without all the hustle & bustle of a large crowd...\\n\\nThis casino is off the strip 2 minutes up the 95 fwy.  I prefer this place as opposed to others since its more laid back, has decent table stakes, ranging from 5 to 100 dollars per bet, and the cocktail waitresses come by quite often...\\n\\nIn the long run, I'm 50-50 winning here, but thats certainly better than other places I tried to run my money up on...\\n\\nThey also have a good food plaza, video game center, movie theater, and bowling alley...\\n\\nTake a trip sometime to Texas Station!..\\n\\n-RR\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Great Food, Great Service.

At first I had my doubts, cause I was suppose to be in bed, due to working the graveyard shift.  But, I promised her I would go, and try out something new.  I'm glad I did.  \\n\\nMax Brenner, located at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is a chocolate filled extravaganza.  Its a good size place to eat, a good place to sit at the bar, or to walk by and get a snack.  It also has a second story, where you can have gatherings of any sort and I believe any size.  Well, according to Jocelyn, the sales & banquet manager, the upstairs gathering place, can fit up to 50, but with the Yelp Elite gathering, it was filled up with about 200 people.  So I'm sure they can probably reserve the place for more then 50 people.  \\n\\nNow, being there, has to be a nice feeling.  Not only for the fact that its a Yelp Elite gathering, but the Staff of Max Brenner made it special.  We had snacks, that were absolutely delicious, and loved the Chocolate Martini.  I felt overwhelmed with one of their waitress, Misti.  She made sure I had something to drink and went out of her way to make sure I had a drink.  Also it was great to meet Jocelyn, who was nice to come around and talk to us.  Despite how busy that night was, I was really impress with the service, the food and how friendly everyone was.  \\n\\nIf you're a chocolate lover, then Max Brenner is a place for you to check out.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: BEWARE: Snails at a French restaurant - escargot. How do you say ROACH???\\n\\nWent here for a group dinner on a Saturday night. It was the only steak place I could get a last minute reservation. Now I know why. Our group was seated and browsing the menu when we saw a roach crawling across the table. Being the girly girl that I am, I screamed EEEWWW and told my friend to kill it. Everyone in the dining room looked at us all snooty because of the ruckus we caused, but umm eeew roach! What would you like me to do quietly and calmly ask it to go away?! \\n\\nAnyhow, the waitress apologized and moved us to another table. We should have left, but being on a schedule and all, we reluctantly ordered our food. Our table had porterhouse steak, chicken, and a fish entree. Good size portions, some were seasoned ok while others were too salty. Overall, didn't hate it but didn't particularly like anything either. \\n\\nThe service of the staff was ok. The guy refilling our drinks and bringing our bread was on point.  However the waitress could have been more attentive given it was not crowded and she should be kissing our asses after the roach incident. The Manager never showed up at our table to apologize nor offer a discount. I probably should have complained but I don't know I just didn't. At a place like this I guess I felt like I shouldn't have to fish for a discount. I know at a \\\"dumpy\\\" chain restaurant like Claim Jumpers I'd have an apology and free something automatically. So, at $50+ per person for mediocre food, bad service, and a roach as an appetizer ... I say this restaurant is a FAIL.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: No No No... spray tan check.... bleach blonde hair check....Nasty food check...will I be back check....Hell No..    I would not have went had it not been for business... You have got to be kidding me?

We agreed on PF Changs as we both love Asian foods. Years back, I worked for Lucille's restaurant around the corner. During those days, I would frequent PF's because it was convenience. Since working there, I haven't been to PF's so I was excited to wine and dine!\\n\\nLocated in the District, once you exit the 215, turn down south on Green Valley, make the immediate right and you'll see PF Chang's. As a stand alone building, you have the luxury of private parking, but be advised, it isn't big. On busy nights, you'll have to park in the main district parking. Approaching the restaurant, you'll notice an outdoor seating area, left of the front doors. Once you enter, the main focal point is a hand painted Asian mural, which looked super cool and depicted some form of historic event. The main bar is located underneath the mural and most of the dining area is to the right. As we were seated, I noticed the mural continued throughout the dining room. There were other Asian artwork and Chinese statues solidifying the type of restaurant. The larger ceiling lights weren't as bright as you would expect and coupled with the dim red lighting on the outskirts of the dining room, it made for a great date night spot. For dinner, our server was super nice. She was accommodating and ensured our orders were correct. That's one thing I was appreciative of. She kept asking questions and I definitely felt our needs were being met. Now that's good service!\\n\\nFor dinner, I wanted to start with an adult like drink. I chose to go with the 2012 Estancia Pinot Grigio for $8 a glass. I actually liked this brand. I felt the wine was super crisp, with a fruity taste with a tangy/zesty type finish. I would recommend this wine again! For dinner, I decided to go with one of their signature appetizers, the Chang's chicken lettuce wraps for $8.95. As described on the menu, wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts served over crispy rice sticks with lettuce cups. The chicken and mushrooms had the same texture so I'm super glad they chose the crunchy chestnut texture. The flavor was jam packed in the dish, kind of borderline salty. The rice sticks were good and crispy. I felt though, the oiliness of the sticks and the oil from the sauce was a little much. I was hoping for more of a health conscious dish, but there was a little too much oil to consider this dish healthy. I know, I know, I should have gone with a salad. I just wanted to try something else! \\n\\nAt the end of the day, my meal was definitely OK. There's no reason for me NOT to return. I think PF Chang's offers a lot of great dishes. This one was just not the best I've had, but I know I'll be back to check something else out in the near future. Great spot to hang with some cool friends!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Best place to get a tattoo.

They closed the location on indian school years ago, for the same reasons.  Those reasons are many now. I stopped back in after being away from Julio G's Take out.  Had 2 beef tacos and rice....  The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years  which equals bland.  The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago.  But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups.  Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it.  Bad news one person taking orders during lunch service in take out and service said orders.  Cleanup needs to be focused on here... They have forgotten to do this.  Yes, a long term customer is seeing another location in slow spiral down the drain.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This is the 1st time I had Cane's. So what's the big deal??

I like to come by myself when I'm feeling like I need a pick me up...an escape from reality...to just kill a few hours.\\nAlways a great time. They not only have rows and rows of old school pinball machines but also pretty much any original arcade game you can think of. The guys that run this obviously have a passion for preserving these games for their patrons to enjoy and just to provide that nostalgic feeling that we all like to be reminded of every now and then. \\n\\nThere are tons of change machines for you to exchange bills. They also have vending machines that serve popcorn and soda in glass bottles!\\n\\nPinball hall of fame is operated as a nonprofit and profits from these machines are donated to the Salvation Army I believe.\\n\\nEscape reality and relive your childhood memories with your favorite games at the pinball hall of fame.\\n\\nDefinitely a gem in Las Vegas.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Today is the second day I've gotten breakfast from downtow's newest fast food establishment.

However, it is oddly located inside US Airways Center.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We recently stayed at The Mirage.  The room was ok.  Unlike a recent poster...the WI-FI was NOT free.  In addition, our television broke on our second night.  We called the front desk who said they would send a \\\"repairman\\\".  At approximately midnight there was a knock on the door from \\\"maintenance\\\".  \\n\\nIn addition, after my shower I realized there was no hair dryer.  We were in a hurry so I had to leave with wet hair.\\n\\nWhen we check out we alerted the front desk to our issues.  The girls was very defensive - and did not appear to make any note of the broken television or lack of hair dryer.  So, if you book a room there, avoid room 10190!!!!\\n\\nThe pool needs to have a better system of screening who enters the pool area.  Two  non-guests entered the pool area, changed there  clothes in the restroom and used the pool including the towels.  They had driven in for the day and meet others at the pool.

So the last time I was in the immediate area, I decided to stop in, and of course, have my usual beer.  It was early evening, so it wasn't crowded, and we got right in. \\n\\nThe inside is very nice - a very comfortable feeling, dim lights, and dark wood. There were some tables with stuffed chairs, and booths along the wall, with the bar in the middle of the space. There didn't seem to be anyone to seat us, so we just sat at one of the tables.  Several minutes later, the hostess appeared and informed us that the table was reserved - but it wasn't for several hours, and since we were only going to have a drink, that there was no problem.\\n\\nThe menu was not extensive, but offered a number of different choices.  We decided to have a drink, and just relax for a while. Midway through our drinks, the hostess again appeared, and apparently the party that had reserved the table came early, and we were asked to move to a booth.  This wasn't a problem, and we agreed.  The hostess was very nice and professional, and comped us our first round.  \\n\\nAs Mabel's started filling up, I could tell it was more of a lounge than a restaurant. The customers were very diverse, of all ages, and although there was the usual Scottsdale players, it was a very laid back atmosphere.  Great for people watching.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a very enjoyable evening. The hostess and our server were exceptional - very friendly and they alone would keep me coming back.  Great atmosphere, great food, and great service.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I ordered the 2 topping medium pizza for 6.99 deal. I was a bit disappointed.

Unfortunately, the main portion of our dinner is still missing in the kitchen somewhere, probably between the air conditioner that constantly dripped on my head and the screaming kids of one of the senior staff/owner. There comes a point where you have to cut your losses and just walk out on something you've lost your appetite for rather than drop some serious coin for a meal you've been waiting for over an hour and a half for and could no longer stomach.\\n\\nI'll be honest, what we had was good. Poutine side, really good. Endive salad, excellent. Duck pate appetizer, yummy. Their version of a whiskey sour was world class. Even the wine I was supposed to have with my entr\\u00e9e was an excellent choice, as it should be after breathing for so long. And I know it takes a long time to make good food - I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and they know how to time things out of a kitchen so that you don't lose your appetite. They also know how to own up to their mistakes. And they know how to properly set the atmosphere of a restaurant, something they have clearly lost touch with here.\\n\\nLet's start from the beginning. I tried to set a reservation through e-mail, which they said would be confirmed via a phone call. Never got the call. Yet when I finally called, they mysteriously confirmed the reservation via e-mail, yet I had never given it to them other than through the e-mail and in fact had reserved through another name. The only way they could have linked it up was via the phone numbers I gave, which matched.\\n\\nNext, the music in the restaurant is so loud, everybody has to scream at each other to be heard, driving up the noise level even more and the very knowledgeable waiter can't be heard describing virtually any of the specials. Normal table conversation is practically impossible. Add in the fact we were sat underneath the air conditioning vents which were set so cold they accumulated condensation that periodically dripped on top of my head or down my face. Except when they came by with a squeegee to mop the ceiling, which bought me a few more minutes peace. Then ramp up the noise level with two kids related to the staff who were either running around the restaurant, crashing dishes together, or crying at the top of their lungs while mom tried to comfort them when they clearly didn't want to be there, and we're on a downhill slide.\\n\\nDrinks arrived quickly, salads and appetizers seemed to be a bit slow, but hey, it's supposed to be quality, I can cut them some slack. Huge portions, you're advised to split everything unless you want a ton of doggie bag material, which is rather inconvenient if you aren't local. And then the wait started. Yes, the au pied de cochon takes 45 minutes, which they didn't warn us about, but an hour and a half after ordering it, it still hadn't arrived, I had lost my appetite for it, and my wife had had enough. We're were done. But apparently they weren't, as they proceeded to insult us by telling us it wasn't fast food and it took time to prepare. Yes, I know that, but when our waiter stopped making eye contact with us 45 minutes ago, perhaps you could have warned us that someone had screwed up and let us order something else rather than have it get worse and worse and worse. No, no, it's ready, stay, pay, and eat something you have no more stomach for, you ignorant American pigs. No apologies, nothing, but it practically took an Act of Parliament just to get our check so we could pay for what we ate and properly tip the staff, who had done no wrong.\\n\\nAs I said, I really looked forward to this, and my wife, who loves foie gras, had looked forward to it even more, but if Jon Taffer ever makes a series about successful restaurants who need a serious makeover because they've gotten too big a head, this should be at the top of his list.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Sometimes the difference between a three and a four star is a hard one.  I think what separates the difference at a museum is one thing - return ability.\\n\\nThe Arizona Science center is some where south of a science museum but makes a decent enough children museum.  \\n\\nThe best exhibit for us, actually, was a kinetic/water area as you enter.  It was a lot of fun and the only thing that was worth returning to.  The air area was very weak.\\n\\nNext up was a construction area that was slightly entertaining, but didn't hold our interest for long.  After that, we moved on to a body area.  This is where we spent most of our time. Plenty of interesting exhibits and things for my four year old to interact with.\\n\\nThe 2nd floor had a slightly fun area . . .electrical equipment and the like.  The third floor was . . .boring.  Thunderstorm, and a small exhibit at that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe water play area was the highlight.  Though my four year old was entertained. . by 2.5 hours we had saw all we needed to see.  I couldn't imagine getting a membership here. . .there just isn't enough to come back to over-and-over again.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I have been getting Brazilians for over 8 years now and I LOVE them! I was once a loyal of BOX Wax client but they moved to Tivoli which, living in Mountains Edge is just not convenient for me. A hop and skip away from me though is The Birthday Suit. I was hesitant to try this place...$35 for a full off Brazilian? Too good to be true! I later  scheduled my appointment and went in to find a cute little lobby with lots of fun zines for me to read. I was then taken into their wax room and left to freshen up- wipes readily available. I was fortunate enough to see Deanna. I gave her my wax history and she hers. We talked about the usual what do you do for a living...you know- anything to keep your mind off this pain for beauty process. Next thing I knew it was all over and Deanna lathered calming awesome lotion over the waxed area. Area btw was completely hairless and I was a happy camper! I paid my $35 + tip & scheduled my next! Been coming here since! Great service, friendly staff and email reminders! Love this place!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Tried this in NYC the first time, and was super happy to see it in LV. Ordered the same stuff, and was just as delicious.\\n\\nIf you're vegetarian, you must try the mushroom burger. Ugh. Get more than one. They're amazing.\\n\\nOh, and those crispy fries. Yes please.\\n\\nDon't forget the custard. It's totally worth it!!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: They don't deliver to the luxor.\\n\\nAfter a long night, I didn't feel like leaving the room the next day for lunch. So me and my cohort decided to order some pizza, to help save some cash over room service.\\n\\nAs usual the menu look great and was very cheap. So I placed the order on my phone and went back to sleep, hoping to wake up to banging on my door with pizza being shoved at me.\\n\\nAbout 30 minutes later I get a call from the driver claiming he couldn't deliver to the Luxor and that I would have to walk down to the taxi pickup to meet him.\\n\\nAt this point I could have just gotten lunch at the crummy Luxor food court for the same price with less effort.\\n\\nThe food was good as expected, but Dominos should really update their ordering service to let you know if you can't have your pizza delivered to your room. That is kind of the whole point of delivery... you don't have to put pants on.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Overpriced, undercooked\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Several friends and I purchased Deal Chicken coupons for the wine class and dinner.  The wine portion was really enjoyable and I learned quite a bit about wine.   \\n\\nThe food, however, was disappointing.  The crab cake appetizer was perhaps the tastiest thing - no complaints there.  The BLT soup was a fun idea and decently executed but was underseasoned.  The same can be said for the chicken, prosciutto and rice.  It was underseasoned and the presentation was terrible.  It looked like it belonged in a death march in a high school cafeteria.  The flat iron steak was fantastic and tasted like filet mignon which was impressive but I wouldn't have minded a little salt.  The creme brulee was tasty enough but was served in two small aluminium tins.  It was rather sad looking.  \\n\\nRight before the start of each course, the chef would come out to explain the dish (which was good) and tell us how wonderful it is (which is bad - let me decide for myself please).  \\n\\nI suppose it was an okay value with the coupon but I certainly would have been upset if we'd paid full price.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Herb N' Legend is an awesome store. They have a huge variety of products for good prices. The employees are very nice and helpful; plus the 20% off glass coupon code works. I would definitely recommend going here and I plan on making more purchases here.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We were hoping to eat at elsewhere in Paris, but a Saturday around noon is a bad time to go out and eat... We walked passed the line of a hundred people for the buffet, and came across Le Burger Brasserie, which we had tried before and liked. There was no wait (woohoo!), so we chose to dine here. \\n\\nThe environment is cool here because they have like 40,000 TVs with various college football games playing (Saturdays, obviously), so when your group is quiet from being hung over, there is still lots of entertainment. \\n\\nThe burgers generally are pretty good. Le Paris, the burger my BF & I both ordered, was really undercooked, and my BFs was overcooked, so we switched patties to save time. (That true love right there.) \\n\\nThe fries are intense. We had a party of four, so we got all three choices to share, and that was WAY too many fries for us. We ate maybe half. I'd stick with just the waffle fries and skinny fries next time. \\n\\nOur service was sporadic, and it took a while to get the check. \\n\\nIt's nothing life-changing, but it's a good choice for when you need some food to feed that hangover, and the line for the buffet almost ends in front of this restaurant. I'd come back.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Meh... precisely. Nice location, outdoor seating, and friendly staff. Mediocre American food. Best thing, it serves breakfast till 3 or 4pm. Basic basic American food with no twist.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Food was Pretty good, beer was cold but service was shitty at best.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Chainstore for hip clothing.  They have some good style selections, which actually included some good sizes for men's pants (32-34).  It worth stopping in for a look to see if something catches your eye like the sweet puffy vest. Prices were a little bit high, but that's probably cause they already did all the premium thrift-shop picking for you. I'll be stopping back every now and then to see what they continue to get in stock. I'm always hoping for that sweet sweater that instantly makes me giggle.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I had my first brazilian wax at Miss T's and she was absolutely wonderful. Her place is on the third floor of an apartment building in the heart of shadyside and has a 'small business charm' to it. Her lounge is immaculately clean with very tasteful furniture. I was extremely nervous for my first waxing experience, but Tu made me feel comfortable and did an amazing job. Not to mention she was quick! She also uses the hardening wax which is much less painful than other waxing methods. I will definitely be going back!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I live in Chicago and my father in law took me to Mi Amigo Ricardo when we were on vacation in Arizona. This place feels like home and I hope to go back every time with visit the Phoenix area. I was introduced to the owner and his sister. My father in law told the owner that I like to make tamales so the owner came to our table and talked to me for 45 minutes about tamales. He brought over their tamales and let me try them. Also he gave me some of their chile powder for free for me to take home. This was so nice of him and I will never forget how great they were here and can't wait to go back.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: It is good if you want to do a quick cleanse.  I have eaten here twice and within two hours after leaving I was making frequent visits to my local commode.\\n\\nIronically, or not, these two occasions were on Mondays.\\n\\nAre we reheating foods that have sat under heat lamps the previous day?\\n\\nTheir egg drop is decent.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Good nails but RUDE MANAGERS! Don't bother making an appointment!\\n\\nThe first time I went to Pink Polish was 3 weeks ago. I noticed that the (male) managers couldn't be bothered to express even an inkling of customer service. I was told (not asked) to sign in, and I got assigned a nail tech right away. She was sweet and did a FANTASTIC job--the best gel nails I've ever had. She made sure all the edges were cleaned up around my cuticles which is super important to me, as it leaves me no reason to pick at them and they last the full 10-14 days. While i was getting my mani, I overheard some techs lauging about one of the managers acting all suave. As if on command, he saddled up to me and complimented my yoga outfit and my nail color choice. I found it odd, but whatever. Just another flirt in a fedora. \\n\\nBut when I checked out, the managers were counting their profits at the front desk, and ran my card without looking at me or saying a WORD. I said please and thank you, and they remained completely silent, as if I wasn't even there. It made me think twice about returning, but my mani held up for a full 2 weeks so I figured I'd give them another shot.\\n\\nSo, about 2 weeks later, when my mom wanted to treat me to a mani-pedi a few days after I had an appendectomy, I suggested we go to PP.  I called at 10 am and made an appointment for us for 11:30. Again, no please or thank you on the phone. He said \\\"OK\\\" and hung up.\\n\\nWe arrived at 11:28 and there were about 5 girls who had walked in right in front of us without appointments. They were all tended to right away. The place was already packed (President's Day). We signed in and stood there waiting for the walk-ins to pick out their polish and to be seated at the nail bar or pedi chairs. \\n\\nFinally, a manager came back to the front desk. We told him we had appointments and he told (not asked) us to go sit in the far end of the lobby, as if we were in their way. He didn't seem to hear us say we had an appointment, so I repeated it nicely. He said, \\\"12:45 right?\\\" And i said, \\\"no, 11:30.\\\" (wtf? why would we come an hour and 15 minutes early to an appointment?!). It was now 11:40. Clearly he hadn't actually given us appointments at all when I called. This place is first come first served, without even the appearance of tending to those with appointments first. \\n\\nWe waited 10 more minutes until a manager finally told us to go sit down at the pedi chairs. The foot bath water was room temperature and felt gross. After a while, a tech came over to us and she seemed super stressed out. She asked me (but not my mom) to pick which pedi I wanted. I looked at the menu and selected \\\"basic pedi.\\\" She didn't seem to like this answer and barked, \\\"You decide!\\\" and left with no explanation. Apparently \\\"basic pedi\\\" would not allow her to reach her daily upsale quota. My mom and I stared at each other, totally shocked, and at the same time, we said, \\\"Let's go!\\\" It was now 11:50 and she didn't even have a nail tech yet.\\n\\nMy mom dried off her feet and then mine (I'm post-op disabled), and when we were leaving, my tech ran up, clearly upset that we were leaving. Like, scared for her life upset, and asked us to please go sit. My mom looked at the managers and said, \\\"We're leaving and aren't coming back. You guys are rude.\\\" The whole place heard us and the managers said nothing. \\n\\nWe then drove down the street and got our mani-pedis at a different, less fancy, less overpriced, much friendlier salon.   \\n\\nIt seems as if the managers are so obsessed with their profits that they think it's ok to treat customers like dog turds, and they work their employees into a panicked frenzy that borders on abuse. I don't blame the techs for any of this; they are sweet and work their fingers off. The managers seem like cocky slave drivers, and I refuse to support this business. I suggest you do the same. However, if you can tolerate the managers' complete lack of respect, and want to support their abusive treatment of workers, by all means, go ahead!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Eh. Food is really good for fast food but they leave out items many times.

Ordered the beef wrap and it tasted fresh. The fries seem to be frozen fries though.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I ate here with a family friend and her mother to celebrate her mom's birthday. \\n\\nUgh, unfortunately, I have to say that the folks that run this place ought to be ashamed of themselves. \\n\\nI already had a bad taste in my mouth even before walking in after seeing the large banner advertising that this establishment is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. \\n\\nWe waited approximately ten to fifteen minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad after hearing of the epic wait times for a table here. \\n\\nIt wasn't worth it. The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were \\\"improperly aged,\\\" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. \\n\\nThe pork chop that my \\\"aunt\\\" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. \\n\\nTo add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. \\n\\nThe service was cordial but average. \\n\\nAll of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner. If you need to advertise that you are the best, it means that you clearly aren't or you already had plans to reduce quality and/or cut costs.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "index": "7", "compressed_output": {"compressed_prompt": "Sentence worst customer friendly locations roaming packs if staffers stop in tracks average two cashier ' s peak times no concern about expecting line.

But this place was dive-y just to be dive-y and the food was nothing special.  I also went on others suggestions of getting the fried rice.  But it was not the best fried rice I've ever had.  I'm pretty easy to please in regards to food, except when I've made better in my own kitchen and I am not a cook.   \\n\\nmajor booooooooo\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Good sandwiches, strong 420 vibe.\\n\\nIt's hard to order anything besides the white widow because it is just sooo good.\\n\\nDon't forget to grab a homemade rice krispie treat. \\n\\nThey deliver, but expect it to take an hour if you live close.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: As I would not like to relive my night here, I am just going to say the following:\\n\\n1. Extremely rude employees\\n2. Horrible music\\n3. You will feel like sardines in a can\\n4. The dance floor is the size of a modest 2 car garage. \\n\\nNever again.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Awwwww, Cheddar Bay Biscuits! \\n\\nReally, what more can I add to Cheddar Bay Biscuits?  Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!\\n\\nOk, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  They often have great specials, like the 4 course meal for $16.99, which includes soup, salad, entree, and dessert.  Oh, and the best part, unlimited Cheddar Bay BiscuitsI   RL also has some great lunch specials for when you want something smaller and cheaper.  Most of the lunch specials are $7.99, which is pretty good for some seafood.   I always feel like I got a great deal when the bill arrives for lunch or dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is pretty big and quite diverse as well.  If you like shrimp, you are in luck because there always seems to be at least a dozen different types of shrimp.  They also have lots of other seafood options to suit everyone in your group.  Don't like seafood?  That's ok too, because they have steak, chicken, and beef options as well.  Everyone should be happy in your party.  If anything, everyone can just eat the unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Have I mentioned how amazing those suckers are yet? Yum!\\n\\nThe food over all is ok.  The dishes are ok.  Nothing is really special or outstanding, but it gets the job done.  The super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup.  It is super duper yummy and I think my favorite thing at RL.  It is a chain restaurant, so at least you always know what to expect, no matter which location you are at.\\n\\nI would normally give Red Lobster a 3 star rating because it is a-ok in my book, but I have to add a couple of stars due to my most recent visit.  I was with my mom, mother in law, and daughter after a fun night out.  When we first arrived, my daughter ran to the lobster tank, which is what she always does.  She loves to look at them and tell me all about them.  It was slow when we walked in and the host noticed how much she was en trailed with the lobsters.  He offered to let her pet one, which we totally went for.  He pulled out a bad boy and let us pet him.  I had to go first because everyone else was scared.  It turns out the rest of the ladies I was with are scared of lobsters.  Oh well, at least I can scratch \\\"Pet a lobster\\\" off of my bucket list now.\\n\\nWell during dinner, my 2 year daughter decided she didn't want to eat and just wanted to look at the lobsters.  We took turns taking her up there to stare at the lobsters.  On one of the trips, she decided she wanted a chip from one of the plates to take with her up there.  She was eating the chip and staring at lobsters when she started to choke on the chip.  She was turning red, then was having trouble breathing due to the chip in her throat.  The host and one of the grandma's was with her, and started to help her get the chip out.  She got it out all right.....By vomiting ALL over the place.  Yes, we were THOSE people.  Luckily it went all over the floor and Grandma (poor grandma) and not on other people or the lobsters.  The team at Red Lobster totally handled it, continued to help my kiddo, who was freaking out, got it all cleaned up, and gave us a ton of wet towels to get everyone cleaned up.  Several of the people even came by to check on my kiddo and our group to make sure we were all ok.  They totally went above and beyond what was needed for the incident.  I felt awful for the mess we had made, but they all kept telling me not to worry about it and they seemed to really mean it.  This was customer service at it's best!\\n\\nThanks again Red Lobster for all of the help you gave us and sorry for the mess!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have to say I did review the reviews of this place as I was waiting so I was biased but they did do a good job.\\n\\nI had lunch with my family here because I wanted falafel. I have to say that the falafel wasn't that good. It tasted too fine as if made from a powder. If that is not the case then I was a bit disappointed that they might have over ground the mix. It was good but not anything I'd return for. \\n\\nI did how ever like their fresh pita bread. It was perfect with my falafel platter which came with some pickled veggies.\\n\\nThey serve hummus on the side which was a little runny for my taste.\\n\\nThe fresh pita and hummus were a good combo but both were slightly bland. I wouldn't always necessarily say it was a bad thing but to have something not so salty but some flavor was missing.\\n\\nMy niece had a kids meal which wasn't anything special. My aunt had a chicken wrap that was good.\\n\\nOverall I would return to try some other stuff. Service was good. The young gentlemen was polite and also brought out a pita bread refill. Prices were also good.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We tried this place based on all the Yelp reviews.  What a disappointment. I feel like I threw away $40. We got 3 rolls and none of them were good. Fish was subpar.  Don't believe the hype!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Mirage was a great place to stay, staff was very courteous.  Rooms have a good layout, inexpensive due to getting 20% off on their specials on facebook.  The pool is really nice, but gets crowded on the weekends.  I hate the idea of having to pay $25 per chair to get to the other areas other than the main pool.  I should all be open, and then there would be enough chairs for most everyone to get sun.  Anyway, the beds were very comfy, rooms are nice, and we were high enough up to have a beautiful view of the strip.  Plenty of things to keep you busy here.  We also had our wedding reception here, and the staff was 5 stars all the way around.  Catering was unbelievable, reasonably priced, did everything that we asked for them.  The hotel does sneak in a $15 \\\"resort fee\\\"charge, per day,  on top of your regular room price).  You have to pay this upon checkout.  The resort fee is basically a sneaky fee that you pay to use the small cardio gym, pool, and internet.  So people that think they are getting free internet because the hotel is nice, are wrong.  I guess knowing that I would be using the internet, I would rather have it like this than actually having an option to pay for it, because if I had a choice, I would not pay the $12-15 fee for it, and be p'od that I have to pay for it.  I know, it doesn't make sense, but I didn't say I was rational.  Valet parking was very quick in getting my car everytime.  The only downside that there wasn't much action in the poker room at the Mirage.  Its the only game I play, and fortunately for me, The Venetian which is right across the road (and much more expensive to stay) and has a lot of action going on.  So it kept me pretty happy rather than having to drive to the Bellagio looking for a action packed poker game.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Can you give zero stars, cuz that's all his place deserves. Will not come back.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Ferb and I finally put down the hookahs and set aside the other unmentionable things and decided a road trip to the \\\"Sin City\\\", Las Vegas was due. \\n\\nAfter a couple of all nighters out and about it wasn't until the last day of our trip that we decided to go to Hash House a go-go. Walking in and being mesmorized by the vast amount of pictures staring back at us, we made our way to the table.\\n\\nAs we sat, we noticed a gigantic edible sombrero looking dish that had some kind of delicious food in it. Then and there I knew that this was going to be a place that would get our alcohol drenched insides back to a legal state.\\n\\nAs we got our menu, we closely examined what each meal consisted of. Even though it was late afternoon, our drenched insides were burning yearning for breakfast, with a salad on the side.\\n\\nA few words to describe that god damn delicious salad. \\\"Oh my, yum yum then some!\\\" The CROUTONS, tasted like they came down from the heavens on a lovely white cloud with trumpets blaring announcing that they have made it to the party, also known as the house salad. Word to the wise though, Do not eat, however tempting it might be, do not eat the sticks that accompany that heavenly salad.\\n\\nNot even halfway through eating the heavenly salad, Ferb's tractor breakfast combo, with the biggest pancake known to man, along with eggs, potato and a scrumptious strawberry, came to the table first.  A couple of minutes later, Phineas's mountain of eggs, biscuit and potato joined in. After stealing a couple of Phineas's food, I knew it was the start of a food coma.\\n\\nOne delicious bite after another, I came to the realization that this was the cure of the alcohol and other unmentionable things that we needed. Bang for the buck, this is the place, and we needed this after a crazy night at the penny slots. That's a whole different story.\\n\\n45 minutes of nonstop eating ended up in laying down on the benches outside the restaurant. With the strip in our sights we knew it was time for more alcohol and penny slots.\\n\\nWe are in Vegas.......\\n\\nTo be continued.......\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have been to this location and the City North location on multiple occasions. We really like the happy hour deals. My boyfriend and I went on a double date the other night and sat on the patio. The server did not seem like he was happy to be there. During our meal we decided that we should leave quickly, not because of the service, but becuase there was an employee (probably off the clock) sitting at the table next to us smoking. The smoke was blowing right into my face and as a non-smoker, I could not stand it.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I really wanted to like this place. I came here with 3 of my friends a few weeks ago. We decided to check it out after the Chandler Light Parade and lighting of the tumbleweed tree, so it was a busy night. We waited about 15 minutes for a table and were quickly served our drinks, but sadly the service went downhill from there. We didn't see our waitress but twice the rest of the evening; once to take our order and once to give us the check. We had to track down someone to refill our drinks and another person entirely brought us our food and was able to get the sides we requested. One of my friends ordered soup that didn't arrive until after his main dish even though the waitress asked if he wanted it early and he said yes. We waited nearly 45 minutes for our order to come out and when it did it was lukewarm. My friends pizza had clearly been sitting out for a while, but I will say they gladly warmed it up. The menu is huge, as are the portions, but unfortunately, they don't seem to do anything overly well. Maybe with the tree lighting they were understaffed, but Iwe weren't impressed. With San Tan just down the street, unless you are searching for a particular game to watch, then I wouldn't put this place on your must-do list.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The King of Tacos doesn't look like much, but the food is great! In fact, when I have been, the place was stuffed from the front to the back terrasse. The poor waitress was everywhere at once! A popular dosh is a bowl made of tacos, and filled with basically everything in the kitchen: veggies, meats, guacamole etc..etc.. I had the cactus salad, it was good, it tasted unlike anything I knew, but needs more cactus!  The huarache is pretty tasty as well, but I'd steer clear of the quesadillas, not enough cheese (to my taste). The guacamole always tends to be cold. odd. Regardless, any dish will plaster your stomach for the day.\\nGo crazy with the desserts, fried coconut donuts, massive churros, snacks on sale by the cashier's desk.. Aaall delicious. In fact, go crazy with everything, El Rey let's you buy guacamole by the gallon, multicoloured nachos, cacti (oh yeah!) and more (like lucha libre masks), while watching mexican Tv.

Very modern and girly fun! \\n\\nI have just gotten my eyebrows done only (so far) ;) and the wax room is exactly what you want it to be like. One review said it looked like a lab, I will admit it is white in there and very bright but when it comes to waxing and body parts I want bright lights so they can see every stray, every hair, etc. \\n\\nOwner and staff have done a great job and are very welcoming. \\n\\nUsed to have to drive to southpark area to get my waxing but no more, I found a place and I'm sticking to it!

They had some nice combinations for their pizzas and the calzone sounded good. They had no tap beers, which is pretty lame as it is the perfect compliment to pizza. They had a nice brick oven which seemed promising. Sadly they ruined the pizza by busting out a rolling pin on it and thinning it out to a cracker like crust. My wife had the veggie and I had the sausage and mushroom. They were decent. But, again they need to hand toss the crust as it was way too thin.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: good ambiance, iffy wine (the house was better than the listed wines) and the cheese was not appropriate as spreadable and quite frankly the bread was bad. stay for 1 drink and move on.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This old school low-pro lounge has a relaxed vibe that is a welcome change from Madison's frenetic bar scene.

Now we all go to Artisans Shoe Repair on Alma School, just north of Warner. The man who runs Abe's now is snotty, stingy and dishonest enough to charge sales tax on labor.\\n\\nThe last time I was in there, as I gave him my purse to have a strap fixed, I noticed that the purse had a smudge on one side. I said something like, \\\"Oh and you probably clean the outside or polish it or something?\\\" He said that would cost me X amount, because he didn't work for free.  His response was so curt  and defensive that I was taken off guard. Before I could respond, he added, \\\"Go home and wipe it down yourself!\\\" At that point, I should've taken my purse and left.\\n\\nWhen I came back to pick it, I saw that he charged me sales tax. I told him that no sales tax is to be charged on labor. He flew off the handle and started ranting about the government charging all these taxes and that it's not his fault and that I should go talk to the mayor if I had a complaint, bla, bla, bla.  \\n\\nWell I did better than that. I called the Arizona Department of Revenue and confirmed that he absolutely should not be charging tax on labor in his shop. Who knows how much money he's stolen from his customers over the years by dishonestly charging them tax? He doesn't deserve anybody's business.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Clean gym, friendly atmosphere, great routes / problems!\\n\\nI stopped by for a climb while on vacation and I couldn't be happier with the decision. Here are some reasons why you should climb here:\\n\\nProblems / Walls: \\nBeginner - Expert throughout the gym...most gyms reserve the overhangs and slanted walls for more difficult problems, but Refuge has bigger holds throughout the gym so you can still have fun on seemingly difficult problems at only a v2-v3 level.\\n\\nStaff:\\nJustin gave me some beta on a few routes that I would have never figured out and the owner Jeff actually worked one-on-one with me providing advice on climbing technique.

It had been years since my first trip, because I had dinner on my first visit and wasn't head over heels for the place.  On this occasion, friends of mine chose Olive & Ivy for a Sunday brunch.  The weather was beautiful in Scottsdale so there was a 30 minute wait to eat outside.  We were not in a waiting mood so we sat inside.  The ambiance of this restaurant is very cool and the service is good.  My frittata was eh.  It was not a meal I would rave about, which is why Olive & Ivy only gets 3 stars from me.  However, my friends really enjoyed their meals.  My friend Jess ordered the Margherita flatbread and commented that she would order it again without hesitation.  My friend Mollie enjoyed her Chicken Panini.  I almost gave Olive & Ivy 4 stars because it does have a fantastic brunch menu. Also, the pine nut pesto and bread that they bring to the table is scrumptious! I will return to Olive & Ivy again with a strategy.  I will order the vanilla buttermilk pancakes (saw them on another table and was super jealous!).  If I go for lunch, I will order a flatbread (because so many of those looked so fantastic).

Anyone who knows me knows I love a good burger, and this place didn't let me down. I ordered their special, their basic burger (aka the Ketchup Burger) with a Brooklyn Beer for 11.99. The burger was 100% Angus Beef, and 100% delicious. The beer was a tasty brown ale that went perfectly with the burger and fries.\\n\\nFor just a bit more than you would spend at Fatburger and about as much as you might spend at Red Robin, you can get a true gourmet burger. Worth checking out. (Planning to try one of their shakes next time.)\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Service was horrible. Food and beer was good, but were ruined by a waitress trying to hurry us out the door and clear plates and glasses before we were finished.

We had the papaya salad and mussumun, both were great. The fried papaya appetizer was really interesting.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: No muss, no fuss. Best feature: the Location which is fantastic being right at the cross of St. Hubert and Ste. Catherine as well as having direct access to Berri/UQAM station and is directly across from the Bus Terminal (Airport bus terminus). So for walking, taking metro, the hotel could not be more convenient - you can get to anywhere in Montreal you'd want to go pretty easily. \\n\\nBeyond that, this is your basic hotel. No super frills - Except they do have free WiFi (which worked really well) and a pool (which I did not have the chance to use). The decor is, yes, a tad dated but it's not gross or sooooo terrible. Neutrogena products are a plus. The buffet breakfast was really pretty good, also.\\n\\nIf you just want a place to crash and don't plan on spending the majority of your time in the hotel, this is a good option. If you need pampering and luxury, maybe skip this one.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Normally we have a great experience when we go to Sweet Tomato, my husband is a vegetarian, so it is perfect for us both to enjoy a meal. We visited Sweet Tomato on Saturday, 9/1/07 at approximately 3:20pm, the place was a wreck...the majority of the tables had dirty dishes on them, there were no customers sitting at them, we stood with our tray for approximately 3-4 minutes looking for a place to sit. There were four of us, so we crammed all four of us into a booth....when we went up to the food bar, the Chicken Noodle soup, which is usually my favorite, was low, I figured that they were bringing more out, after I got my breads, took it back to my table, sat and ate my salad, went back and the soup was still not filled...there had been a \\\"manager\\\" taking the temperature of the soup and that was it....the place was disgusting., kids were running around screaming, a toddler was screaming, and no manager came to the party to quiet them down......I don't know what happened that day but my party of four was not real pleased with the conditions...\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: In every city, usually across the street or within a short walk of the High School there is a neighborhood hangout. \\n\\nThe food can run from just average, to exceptional.

From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Heck, even on the inside it doesn't either. \\n\\nYes, Elmer's is a hole in the wall type place. One that probably wouldn't even make Guy Fieri's DDD list. But the food is good.\\n\\nI ordered chips, steak burrito and a drink. The tab came to under $9 and if you look at the picture of the chips, it's kind of basic. The Salsa btw comes in plastic squirt bottles. LOL. \\n\\nBut my steak burrito was the real deal and bomb!

I had just eaten a late breakfast, but I needed to check my email so my LA ATT.com dsl service add on gives me nationwide free wifi at McD's, Starbucks and many other locations. So, I don't like to go to a place and just use the wifi and not buy anything, so I bought the Angus burger swiss cheese/mushroom and it was okay, 3 stars, but I'm deducting 2 stars for the crappy wifi service... I've used McD's wifi service many times and at this location, I dicked around for nearly an hour and couldn't get it to work... So I bought food I didn't really want and so it was a big waste of time and money. I had to go to Starbucks and they saved my day.\\n\\nHey, I like the Carl's Jr, Big Carl burger better anyway and it's 40% cheaper.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Went in for the first time time today.

As it was the end of the year and there was an upcoming New Years event, the whole city was crowded.  We stayed at one of the end of the hallway rooms within Carnaval Towers.  This meant a long walk from the elevators.  I thought that a room at such a spot would be quiet but it was unusually noisy during the night as either the walls are thin or the neighboring guests were loud.\\n\\nI got lost here a few times while wandering through the hallways on our floor.  I was surprised to find out that it is directly connected with Margi Gras tower.\\n\\nOur room itself was nice and clean.  Although the TV was an old fashioned CRT,it was functional.  Our mattresses were also nice and firm.  I also liked that the bathroom was clean and functional.  All and all, it was quite a decent room.\\n\\nThe casino area on the ground floor seemed typical of what I expected of a Las Vegas hotel.  The smell of cigarette smoke lingers everywhere and the slot machines are loud on the dimly lit floor.\\n\\nOne thing that I did not like were pushy salespeople attempting to sell timeshares.  I'm not sure if they were part of the hotel but they were stationed at the doorways and said that they held their sales presentation at this hotel.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Horrible Service.  I have not been to a kona grill in some time due to gluten free restrictions I have to take into account starting a few years ago.  We were shopping in the area and seen they now have a dedicated Gluten Free menu.  When we arrived we asked the hostess if we could view the menu first just to see what options we had.  She was fairly rude, gave us one menu (for 3 people to look at) and walked away.  We decided to stay and eat and then got a server who obviously had no idea about gluten free.  We became an inconvenience for him.  He didn't know any details, didn't offer to ask, and then offered to do a side of fried rice (we've had this gluten free at other places).  About 35 min later I believe the manager, who by the way saved this from being a 1 star review came to our table.  Very nice and asked about our gluten free request.  We let him know we have to eat gluten free.  He then stated that the fried rice Is not gluten free and offered to give us something else.  What I failed to mention before is that when we ordered we asked if we could do a side of fruit with our  turkey burgers.  We were told \\\"No\\\" we don't have that as an option.  Back to the manager, he said we can do vegetables or fruit for you.  Awesome we will take the fruit we said.  We wanted to order that originally but were told you don't have that.  The manager said they do and will take care of that for the future guests to know.  The meal ended up being good, we got what we wanted, but the service was horrible and two out of the three employees treated us like we were weird people due to our food requirements.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: A favorite local breakfast spot.

{"prompt": "Sentence: Other than The Back Abbey in my hometown Claremont, CA., this place had the best gourmet burgers I have enjoyed in quit a while.  It was so good we went back twice.  \\n\\nLe Burger Brasserie has a French theme offers signature gourmet burgers prepared with chicken, salmon, lobster, lamb, vegetable and and beef.  I recommend the Le Paris and the Le Bleu burgers both 100% Black Angus beef.  The Le Paris had Brie cheese, caramelized onions and smoked bacon.  The Le Bleu has Bleu cheese, avocado and smoked bacon.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: It's not that India Garden is actively bad, but there is not much to recommend it either. The food is your typical Americanized grub, the Indian equivalent of \\\"Chinese Takeout.\\\"\\n\\nThe service is pretty unfriendly. The waiter mumbled unintelligibly over the blaring music; then, he looked impatient and put out when I asked him to repeat what he said. No one from the waitstaff looked like he wanted to be there.\\n\\nThe only highlight was that the vegetarian and some of the chicken dishes are \\\"half off\\\" after 10pm. My order of chicken saag at $5.50 probably does qualify as a bargain, but the watery saag and the stingy bits of chicken make the regular price kind of a rip off. So after normalizing for the overpriced menu, I consider the discount to be more like 20%. \\n\\nConclusion: there are better options unless you are trapped in Oakland past 10pm and starving.\\n\\n2.5 stars\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I tried a boba slushie here....IT WAS AWFUL. Seriously, it tasted so bad, I literally thew it out as soon as I stepped out the store! Sadness...\\n\\nI will say that at least they look like they have a good variety of fruit toppings...but otherwise, I'd rather go ANYWHERE ELSE for a quick dessert. \\n\\nAlso, the service when I came here was very slow (I guess on a Sat afternoon, there is only 1 older lady working here?\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I work in the area so have eaten at this location numerous times.\\n\\nThe location is right across from the Mandalay Bay so due to it's proximity to major hotels it's often very busy which means a longer wait then other fast food joints off the strip.\\n\\nThe staff do their job. Nothing more nothing less. And like most Panda's the food is edible. Nothing spectacular here.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This place is awesome. Very much impressed. It's funny I was the only Non asian person in there lol\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Huge portions at reasonable prices and good, cheap beer. Toto, we're not on the Strip anymore.\\n\\nWe came here on a recommendation from a friend, and was one of the reasons we came downtown in the first place. \\n\\nWe started with the fried mushrooms that were tasty and PLENTIFUL, at a great price. When we found out the soup was New England clam chowder, my husband HAD to order it for the sheer curiosity factor of how they would do clam chowder in the desert. The answer: Not well. There were carrots?? in it, and it was so thin. The taste wasn't bad, but   doesn't get the Bostonian seal of approval.\\n\\nMy husband had the fish and chips which were HUGE, and the cole slaw was actually really tasty. He said the fish was great, not greasy or heavy. I had a cheeseburger, and it was solid. I had onion rings with it, and they were solid but a little too much breading.\\n\\nI had the Hefeweizen and it was AWESOME, and a huge glass was less than 4 bucks. My husband liked his choice as well.\\n\\nOverall, a nice change of pace from the overpriced stuff on the Strip!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I have been in the food industry for 26 plus years, as an chef from Ireland, I have both been to France and cooked in France. This is by far some of the worst prepared french dishes I have EVER had. The brioche and I only call it that as that is what it was called on the menu looked and tasted nothing like brioche.\\n The basket of warm  sliced baguette, which is lunch bread in France, was a strange item to receive for breakfast. The one positive for me was the busboy kept the coffee cups and water glasses full.\\n\\n Over all this was a restaurant experience I won't be able to get back.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Really bummed about my experience here.  After a great weekend vacation in Sedona we stopped by Scottsdale for a night before returning home.  Our intention was a day and night of ultimate relaxation.  This place was everything but relaxing.  \\n\\nThe reason we picked Firesky was because of the pictures of the beautiful pool area.  The pool area actually doesn't really look like the pictures.  The kiddy pool is separated and kind of resembles what we thought it would look like.  However, we didn't expect a bunch of children in swim diapers. \\n\\nThe adult pool was like spring break in CanCun with a bunch of 20 somethings drinking and partying.  100 people were packed into the area and music was blaring.  Occasionally two music systems would be running and you would hear hotel music under the louder party music.  \\n\\nWe got massages hoping to wind down after a very intense not expected pool scene.  Massages were marginal especially for the price that is being charged.  \\n\\nDisappointed all around :/\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I notice mainly good reviews for the place and the rumours has it that this is the best place for fish n chips in Montreal. Unfortunately my only experience of it today was not flattering at all. The fish missed seasoning completely. Without the sauces it was completely tasteless. The same goes for the infamous burger that everyone told me to take. Tasteless again. Other than that the waitress was excellent and the environment as well.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I rate The Fountains of Bellagio 5 of 5 stars. As a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas Strip, I am also a frequent visitor to the Bellagio and specially The Fountains of Bellagio. Dancing water fountains which are synchronized to the music are graceful, beautiful and relaxing. Each show is a totally different and worth waiting until the next show! My best tip is that if you are planning to stay at The Bellagio, make sure you get a room with a fountain view! You can listen to the music on your TV while you look down on the fountains. Each show is about 3 to 5 minutes long and show times are every 15 minutes. The fountains look good in the daytime but really shine in the nighttime! Wow! Highly recommended!!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Fun place for a date or to hang with friends! Restaurants, dessert places, bars, and lots of nice places to take pictures. It's better to come here when it's not freezing cold outside though hahahaha.  Definitely recommend this place.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We live close by,and have frequented the place for some time.  We weren't happy with our recent visit.  The Miso Soup tasted like sea water.  Wayyyy too salty.  Any taste I could perceive beyond the salt was too 'fishy'.  Not good.  The rice on the sushi was either not fresh or undercooked, far firmer than it should be.  Flavor was absent on rolls, partially because the actual meat portions are less than the fingernail on my little pinky.  Far diminished from our past visits.  One of our rolls also tasted 'fishy', which might not seem strange except that it was a Crab Roll.  \\nThe service was backwards as well.  She brought out two plates of sushi, then forgot to bring the ginger and wasabi, Lol.  After she came back with that, we politely requested the Kikkoman.  We like the ambiance and location and which is so close, and we will try it ONE more time.  Hopefully the management will read this review and get their act together.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: There was about a 10 minute wait even though half of the tables were open.  I did not like the bacon, at all...too smoky and hard. My omelet was bland. There wasn't anything special about the french toast. And I can't get over the $4.50 iced tea (similar to other restaurants at Aria). The bill was about $50 for 2 people, before the tip. There are better places to have breakfast in Vegas.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Stopped by on 08/22/14 for a quick dinner on the way to Wet N Wild. Ordered a BBQ mix plate, boba milk tea and thai tea w/ boba. The teas were good but the boba was super mushy. However, for $2.50-3.00 can you really complain?\\n\\nThe food was really similar to an L&L in regards to taste and price. The BBQ mix plate comes with a couple pieces of chicken, a handful of sliced beef and a strip of kalbi. The macaroni salad was a little bland and just ok. The meats were well seasoned and overall tasty; I just wished there was more than just a single strip of kalbi!\\n\\nNot sure if the food is worth driving down here for since it's similar to L&L and any other Hawaiian joint that serves BBQ style food. I probably would come again for thai tea though the next time I'm on this side of town\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Unlike the review from the 22nd we were treated exceptionally. We are a younger couple without the glitz and glam but we were treated like royalty. Perhaps the difference was the server. In our case we had Paul and he was absolutely awesome.   \\n\\nBefore going on with the review let me back up a bit. We were looking for a place to eat that night and were walking through the Bellagio when my wife said, \\\"That Olives restaurant has a balcony but it is first-come, first-serve so we probably could not get out there.\\\". Me being the kind of guy who would rather ask and get told \\\"no\\\" than not ask at all went up to the hostess and asked about any openings on the balcony. To my amazement I was told there would be a table for two in 45 minutes if I cared to wait. With the night being beautiful and a chance to sit outside and eat we readily agreed to wait. Approximately 30 minutes later we were led out to the balcony and seated. The balcony is small, I'd venture to guess there was enough space for about 30 people. I do not know for sure but I believe the tables directly next to the edge overlooking the Bellagio Fountain were reserved for Black Card (mlife) holders which we were not. We were seated at the back of the balcony but we could still see the fountains and had a beautiful view of the strip. (We also just happened to be seated at 7pm when the fountains played every 15 minutes so we saw the whole line up of songs during our dinner...I highly recommend this timing). \\n\\nLike I said in the beginning, Paul was our server and he was wonderful. He treated us like we were special though we were not in suits, not bedazzled in jewelry, and certainly no high-roller status. We were dressed nicely though a few on the balcony were dressed very poorly even for a casual dining restaurant. We were served with smiles and warmth as was everyone else out there including the poorly dressed group though by a different server.\\n\\nPaul even took our picture for us with our camera during what he called \\\"Picture time\\\". He had an excellent sense of humor that matched ours which seems hard to do these days. He made our night. \\n\\nThe customer service, view, and fountains were amazing but the food...boy was that some of the best food we have eaten in a while. The drinks were made perfectly, the complimentary bread basket paired with the Olive Tapenade was one of a kind. Delicious! The flat bread...well it did not last long. For entrees my wife ordered the chicken and I ordered Salmon. My meal was perfect, my wife's chicken was overdone but still tasty. We could have probably requested a new one but it was not inedible and it was still very delicious so we did not. We were too full for dessert though what I saw others eating looked amazing. \\n\\nOverall, an excellent experience and I would go back if I was back in Vegas. I also highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal. If you are willing to wait for the balcony I would do it and try to time it for the more frequent fountain shows. Well worth it! \\n\\nTry to get Paul as he was amazing, though the rest seemed equally as awesome.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Solid authentic Mexican food. Close knit Mexican family. Servers are a little unfriendly, but who cares when you're digging into endless chips and 4 kinds of salsa. We were seated at the bar, which was uncomfortable because of a large edge. Great food, Coronas a plenty, and Spanish tv.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Unfortunately this place has been over rated by a lot of people who want to think they're getting \\\"real\\\" BBQ or going to a \\\"real\\\" biker bar (it's laughable that some people believe either of these things as authentic at Mac's).  \\n\\nMy suggestion? Head out of the little Mac comfort zone to experince some real time biker bars or travel some back roads to experience some real time BBQ where it's cooked without the \\\"bottom line\\\" being its driving factor.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The Hertz in Chandler was very pleasant when we first got our rental car.. when I tried to get a hold of them to ask questions about when and where to drop off the car I called 20 times got disconnected after hearing them laughing and joking in the background I got placed on a 20 minute hold with out anyone checking back with me. I also talked to Cassie would told me that her computers were down and would give me a call back as soon ad they were back up which never happened. When I finally got a hold of them again I spoke with Tyler who was very rude and wouldn't let me tell him why I was calling. He cut me off and told me I didn't know what I was talking about. I will NEVER rent from them again!!! I wouldn't even give them 1 star...\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Part of my quest to eat something that's not available in Flagstaff after lacrosse games in Scottsdale.

Extremely unorganised business and critically understaffed, we were waiting for over a half hour for a simple coffee. Only two people working on a very busy Saturday morning, they had their work cut out for them!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Olive and B.S. \\n\\nOnce again the hype outlives the product. I had lunch there again today and left disappointed again. I eat lunch out 5 days a week always at nice places mostly on business. This place does not stand up against others in the neighborhood and price range. Parking is always a hassle the valet is a mess and takes too long because the garage is a way off by Urban Outfitters. The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses. After putting my folder on the floor, no space on the table, I ordered. Veal and spinach ravioli, four very small excellent ravioli for $15, one of which was gristle and which I had to spit out. The portion was a ridiculous excuse for an entree portion. I'm done with this place and don't see going back. It's just not worth the price or hassle, especially given the 100 other choices within a three block radius.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Great place to grab a drink on the strip.  We went there on Friday night and it was Packed.  The crowd is 30+ and older.  The bartender was very friendly and the drinks are great.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I live in a Foodie town, and sometimes while I'm in Vegas I never seem to find anything that great unless I eat at an expensive restaurant. So when I do make that choice to eat expensively I go to Smith and Wollensky...mouth is salivating now thinking about their steak with gorgonzola cheese baked on top....\\n\\nI love eating here and make a point of stopping by every time I'm in Vegas. You just can't pass up a good steak...\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Rosati's was a Chicago favorite for 40 years, now expanding in Las Vegas.  This Carry out only location - open a couple of years- offers excellent varied type ( Thin, Thick, Double Dough, Deep Dish)  Chicago Style Pizza as well as Pasta, Calzones, Ribs, Shrimp, Chicken, Salads and Sandwiches.  \\n\\nWe ordered an Extra Large Thin Crust with Mushroom, the pizza was ready on time ( we picked it up) hot and tasty.  They scrimped on the mushroom which got two complaints from the family saying \\\" we dont have this problem at Metro..\\\" \\n\\nNow for the true Italian/ American test: Overall the pizza was gone in 7 Minutes. Including the self evaluation done by each member De Famiglia.  Couldn't have been too bad right? So, I recommend this as a great carry out alternative on the West Side or Sumemrlin area, but dont expect abondanza Ingredients.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Maybe I'm just not knowledgeable enough about Mexican food or something, but I really don't understand the hype about this place/chain. Everyone is always talking about how great and \\\"authentic\\\" it is, but it just seems like standard, uninteresting Mexican fast-food fare to me. Plus, from what I have always heard, although Americanized-Mexican dishes rely on mounds of cheese, real, authentic Mexican food is rarely covered in a cup and a half of shredded cheddar. I don't know, though The food was okay and the service was okay and the prices are okay, but that's really all I can say about it...it's okay. I will say that, when I was in, their salsa/veggie bar was absolutely wrecked. Maybe some quality salsa would've somehow elevated my rolled tacos to another level, garnering another star in the process, but there was no way I was going to pick through that mess to find out. Hell, maybe I'll try it again and it'll knock my socks off. If so, I'll be sure to update this review accordingly, but as of now, I'm in no real rush to go back and see.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Good grief!  I thought not being able to park here for over 7 days was my problem... now I realize that simply PARKING here is my problem.  I tried to be green by buying a bus ticket on the Van Galder to get me to Chicago.  Silly me. I drove here to catch my bus on a Friday around 10am only to find the lot completely full with cars -- folks were even double-parked in no-parking areas.  Unable to park my car, I had to sadly watch the bus come and go and then catch a ride in a gas guzzling car down to Chicago anyways. Oh, and that Van Galdar ticket is non-refundable to top it off.  So this lot is not just \\\"not-long-term-enough\\\" it also \\\"owes me $30\\\" and is \\\"waaay too-small\\\" to actually count on as an option.

Their service is phenomenal - we've been very impressed with the professionalism.  The quality of the photos is excellent, the contract process is effortless and, most of all, it is so much fun!!  Our guests from both weddings have continued to talk about how much fun the photo booth was - we outfitted the booth with hats and boas and other costume items and set up a scrapbooking station just outside of the booth.  The booth operator seamlessly worked with us to create a fun environment for our guests, the couple got very fun guestbooks, and the guests got fun photos to take home as \\\"favors.\\\"  I recommend Party Booths!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I'm not sure why they serve pickles with the bread, but they are fantastic!  I had a hard time not eating all of them.  I ordered a ribeye that was rubbed with garlic and it was cooked perfectly!  I have been to a lot of high end steakhouses and I can honestly say this steak is near the top of the list.  I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere though.  For the price, it was pretty loud and crowded and tables were basically crammed into a giant room with very little in the way of ambiance.  The service, on the other hand, was top notch.  The waiter was excellent at being very attentive without seeming like he was hovering over us.  Our water and wine were constantly refilled and the food came out at an excellent pace.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Walked in before noon time today by myself, the place was empty.  The hostess asked if I would like to sit at the bar or full service, I said full.  She put me right behind of the order machine (which I wasn't aware of at that time) where every waiter or waitress took their orders would go behind me to enter those orders.  Worst place to sit in the house!\\nMy server was okay, he wasn't very helpful when I asked a few questions.  First I asked about what type of hot tea is good for sore throat (from cold), no specific answer was given, fine!  So I ordered a tropical green tea, not bad.\\nThen I started with a cup of wonton soup, but I tried to change my order for a bowl instead of cup after 10 seconds of my order, he said too late, the order has been entered (the machine just right behind of me, ding2x).  I felt like it was quite rude to say that..., sure there's a way to revise.  My vibe was going down south from that point.\\nAfter glancing at the menu, I decided shrimp candied walnut based on one of the yelp review.  Then he asked if I want a lunch portion that came with soup or salad, or dinner (he only gave me a dinner menu).  Well..., if I knew it did come with soup, I may not order the wonton soup in the first place, since I'm not a salad person.  I ended up with a dinner portion.  I wasn't impressed with the meal, it was a cold creamy dish.  The white rice was dried, tasted like overnight rice.  Had a few bites, decided to take it home.  Since the place was getting busy, all the entire of orders just came straight behind me!!  Very annoying!!!  The manager came by and asked if everything was okay, I didn't want to make a scene out of it, so I was politely said okay.  All of these happened, I still gave 18-20% tip, but I won't be back again..., thanks to the hostess, service & disappointed food.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I have mix feelings on this place, that's it, 3.5 stars...\\n\\nTwo of us stopped at Bobby's after a movie, being my 1st time here, didn't really know what to expect, and I was in flip-flops...So here's a bit of recap:\\n\\n-Bread basket - warm baked garlic/cheese bread, definitely one of a kind...\\n\\n-Blue Point Oysters on half shelf - fresh and mid-siazed oysters, pair with fresh lemon juice, some horseradish and some tabasco sauce, this just made my day!! Surprisingly, the usual customers of Bobby's don't seem to have oysters with tabasco cuz when I asked for it, our waitress had to reconfirm, and it didn't come in the original bottle, instead was pulled into a little sauce/juice cup...just kinda of weird... But I don't mind as long as the oysters are good!\\n\\n-Cannelloni with Mariana sauce - tasty and filling, but feel like the Mariana sauce was kind of short, maybe they could pour a bit more sauce? It's a bit dry eating without the sauce...but overall it's good.\\n-Lobster linguini - many different kinds of seafood (lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels) in a Mariana sauce. It didn't give me a surprising feeling, I think it was just average, and the noodles were a bit dry and hard...\\n\\n-No dessert. What a surprise? Well, they 'presented' the whole menu on a tray. Seriously? I've seen raw food being presented on a tray to show the freshness, not dessert. I guess when I order dessert, I always wait for the excitement to come, to surprise me, I mean it's dessert, you can do so many imaginations with it, I have never seen restaurants have created a same exact look of dessert before (unless it's the standard form)... so I'm expecting something does not only feed my taste bug but also eye-catching...after I saw the whole presentation, I didn't want any, that just blew off my hopes..\\n\\nOverall experience at Bobby's was just fine. It was a very slow Sunday night, but I do appreciate very much the live music...And I just saw they have a $30 special dinner menu? Since when? Today? Cuz I wasn't told at the restaurant yesterday (3/20)...\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Hands down my favorite sushi spot in town. Great services, great food, great atmosphere.

I did get talked into the gel nails because I don't have a boyfriend and apparently gel nails will make that happen. There was some miscommunication on the price I thought I would be charged and what I ended up having to pay. It was a lengthy process as well but overall, I will definitely be back. She glitter-fied my nails. That's all that matters\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This is a difficult rating for me to give. The in-store experience was fantastic. The furniture selection is strong and the prices are fair. If I would have rated Living Spaces the moment we left the store they would have gotten a 4 or 5 from me. \\n\\nBut-- the customer service you receive after leaving the store, presumably from the corporate office, is very poor. We ordered multiple pieces of furniture, including a custom sectional. The couch arrived with one of the pieces of furniture made with the wrong fabric. They never followed up with us like they promised -- we had to call three times. It took a month to get a replacement piece. Also, the driver tripped on his way in the house ripping the fabric on another piece-- it has still not been replaced.\\n\\nBefore I received this bad service I made the mistake of recommending them to my parents. They told my parents the drivers would call a half hour before they arrived to deliver their furniture-- it didn't happen, they just showed up. When my father wanted to return a couple pieces that didn't work out, they told us they would call a day before to give us a pickup window. It never happened. We've waited all day today for it to come-- it is now after 6pm, they never showed, never called. \\\"Good bye\\\" to my Saturday, thanks Living Spaces!\\n\\nThe good people who work at the Scottsdale store are really undermined by the corporate office, it's too bad. I would pass on Living Spaces because of it. The customer service department is awful. They aren't accountable. And they apparently have no communication with the drivers. Bottom line, they just aren't ready for the business. The only reason I didn't rate them a \\\"1\\\" is due to the positive shopping experience.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place needs to be featured on an episode of Bar Rescue.\\n\\nBeyond terrible service.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: TI was is a nice hotel right on the strip. I was actually expecting more to be quite honest. The room was basic, small, but clean and nice. The casino was basic and there was one crazy bar downstairs as well. I just wasn't blown away by it. I love how the resort fee needs to be added on if you book from an outside service. The front staff was very helpful in getting me the room I wanted, that was for certain. I was hoping with a casino open all night there might be some food. The casino was fine, I just always hope the drinks come fast. The dealers were friendly and the pit bosses were nice about minimums. Still....I wasn't overly blown away. The location is great. There is a $7 shuttle to the airport (do this!! not the cab). Still, I wasn't stunned with the place.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We live in Fountain Hills, and our water softener was leaking.   We called Chris at Aqua Pro, and we were very happy with the repair he performed, as well as providing us with the name of someone he would recommend for irrigation system service.

{"prompt": "Sentence: In a town with so many options, you're not missing much if you skip jacs.  Their beer list is extensive, but that's not saying much in Madison.  I've been twice; once for beers, and once for brunch.\\n\\nBeers: bottom line, sit at the bar if you want service.  If you're on the other side of the restaurant, you might as well be invisible.  jacs appears to be one of those places where the busier they are, the more likely you are to be taken care of; it's fine for waitstaff to be chatty with the bartenders, of course, but not at the expensive of obviously-waiting customers.  If your brew of choice isn't on tap or on special, be prepared to pay more for a bottle there than you would in most other places.\\n\\nSaturday brunch: a better experience, over all. Entree pricing is in line with what you might expect elsewhere, and nicely enough, the first bloody mary, screwdriver, or mimosa you order with a brunch entree is $2.  Stick with the mimosa in this case; those received positive reviews, whereas my bloody mary was a disaster of a drink.  The mix is made in-house but is neither spicy nor interesting, but could have been saved if it hadn't been for the lethal layer of vodka floating on top.  Garnished with a lemon slice,a pickle, and a pimiento-stuffed olive and served in a small cocktail glass, this is truly an amateurish effort, and not even worth the $2 addition to the meal.\\n\\nThe food also received mixed reviews; I enjoyed the eggs benedict (the portion of ham served in this dish is both delicious and generous) and the herbed potatoes were quite tasty.  The crepes my friend had were disappointing; she said she can make better.\\n\\nAfter a couple tries, I'm done with jacs.  I was surprised to see that they've been open since 2009; the place has a nice ambience but the service, the beverages, and the food all come with the feeling of a restaurant that has very recently opened and is still working out the kinks.

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  \\n\\nNothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   \\n\\nI was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \\n\\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  \\n\\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So, being stuck at the Golden Nugget for a conference with a limited amount of time, I decided, (translation - had no choice) to give this place a try for breakfast. I wish I had seen enough of my waiter from yesterday to know if I had the same guy - and hopefully he saw too little of me to realize I was the same person, but the food and service were terrific (yes, only 2 stars. \\\"terrific\\\" is all relative).\\n\\nSat down, took my order and before I could blink....wa la! my food!.

It's like being outside in the best temperature in Phoenix, even if it's over 100 degrees.\\n\\nFood was very good.  Relatively large portions for an upscale establishment.\\n\\nMy wife had the $15 salmon, recommended by the server as the best thing on the menu, and it did not disappoint.  Would easily cost 2x at other restaurants, and probably be worth it. \\n\\nI had the Hangover cure, and it was easily enough food to take home and have for breakfast the next day.  Very tasty for $10.  And I got the $3 spicy bloody mary that came with it, which was one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.\\n\\nAt noon, on the Sunday we went, a really nice band came in and played some great acoustic rock, very nice.  \\n\\nIt was one of the best brunch experiences we've had in Phoenix.\\n\\nAdd to this the fact that all wine on the menu, if ordered by the bottle, is 50% off, and that's an outstanding deal.\\n\\nWe'll be back.  I kicked myself for not coming back sooner.  \\n\\nMy five star is a rating that is influenced by pricing.  I am a cheap bastard with expensive tastes, so I reward a restaurant that I not only feel I had great food, nice ambiance, and good service, but that I got my money's worth.\\n\\nAnd The Vig Uptown is all that and then some.  I strongly recommend it to all.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This review is for the automotive \\\"services\\\" I received there recently. I brought in my car just for a simple seasonal tire switch. My regular mechanic couldn't take me and of course being the impatient type (plus winter was TOOOO long this year) I really wanted to put my summer tires on. Well, I was greeted very nicely and told it would be an hour wait. No problem. The store itself is big, clean and well stocked. I then get paged to be told that I needed 1000$ of suspension and brake repairs!!! I had just got the car fully inspected a month before by my regular trusted mechanic since I want to trade the car and he found nothing wrong with the suspension or brakes. I told them thanks for the tip, please put my tires on that is it. Be careful, there was an Area Manager that day in the garage and they were trying really hard to upsell or promote BS repairs on a lot of customers. I witnessed another customer tell off the service tech regarding BS repairs. Honestly I rarely go to CT for automotive services, but can tell you the LaSalle branch is a lot more honest than these crooks.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Candied yams 4.1\\nFried okra 4.1\\nCurry chicken 4\\nFried chicken 3.2\\nBeans and rice 3.2\\nCollard greens 3\\nCatfish 3\\nOnion soup 2.9\\nMac and cheese 2.5 prefer al dente \\nMeatball pasta 2.4 prefer al dente\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So Juan's work is BAD ASS, Basically everything on chopper I have had done by him looks great and I get compliments on everything all the time. people are shocked when I tell them it is powder coat not paint.  \\n\\nSo why the 2 stars...as his biz grew his delivery time went to shit for us \\\"small people\\\".\\nExamples:\\n--first starting his biz a set of wheels, quoted 5 days, got them in I beleive 4 days\\n2 yrs later motorcycle frame  q\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Common Market is the freakin' jam!  If you're in Plaza-Midwood and scoping out a convenience store/coffee house/beer market/bakery, you should visit this place.  It's practically a hipster general store.\\n\\nThey have a lunch counter that is packed at lunchtime.  Your typical lunch counter staples, like reuben on rye, clubs, and paninis, but with fancier breads, meats, and cheeses.   They have a convenience store selection of chips and homemade cookies/brownies to complete your lunch. Did I mention that they are several brews of coffee?  Plus, its only a $1 if you bring your own mug!  The beverage selection is out of this world!  Many foreign brands with many, many syllables.  \\n\\nCommon Market is also loaded with hipster trinkets;  like dress-up Jesus magnets, cooler and more socially conscious-than-thou bumper stickers, and \\\"papers\\\"...he he.  So if you want to get your lunch on, caffeine on, or just roll your own...this is your joint.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Saffron Flavors of India, not to be confused with plain old Saffron on East DI, is the first Indian Chinese fusion restaurant I've seen. Though traditional dishes found on the menus of most Indian restaurants make up the bulk of the menu, some interesting plates catch your attention immediately. One dish that sounded particularly enticing to us was the Paneer Chili ($7), an appetizer of homemade, mild Indian cheese dressed in a sweet and sour sauce with green peppers and onions. I know it sounds strange, but it was actually quite successful. The sauce wasn't sickeningly sweet and artificial tasting as sweet and sour often can be, and we loved tasting Chinese flavors in a dish that actually had some heat.\\n\\nNon-fusion dishes were just as successful. The sauce of the lamb rogan josh ($15) was a deep brick red and flavor-PACKED, letting you know someone loved it for awhile. My mushroom and sweet corn masala ($13) was served in a sauce that was equally complex and flavorful, yet I was disappointed to see that canned mushrooms were used. The sauce was so incredible, however, I really didn't mind at all. Anyone who can make canned mushrooms taste so good gets a big culinary thumbs up from me. I also enjoyed the addition of corn, which replaced the more common peas found in many Indian mushroom dishes.\\n\\nFun little extras included a superb raita with crunchy chunks of cucumber and crispy onion pakora. If you love onion rings, the latter is a must try. We also loved the bullet naan ($5), a flatbread stuffed with cheese, potatoes, chickpeas, onion, cilantro, and green chilies. It made me think this restaurant could do well as the first Indian pizza joint.\\n\\nSadly, I fear this restaurant may not survive due to it's location. It's actually fairly easy to get to as it is right off the 95 at Craig, but the new strip center it's in is dead with no signs of budding life. I hate seeing these mom and pop's dissolve - R.I.P Taqueria Los Parados and Vegas Cafe.\\n\\nI hope I can entice you to go by mentioning that restaurant.com is currently offering certificates valid for dinner only. Today they have 60% off for St. Patty's Day with the code LUCKY, but if you sign up for their updates they offer discounts just as deep nearly every week. You can also same money by taking advantage of their great lunch buffet. The number of items is limited, but it's a bargain at just $8.99.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We gave this place several chances. The first bad experience was when they claimed it would be 45 minutes to an hour for our delivery. An hour and a half later, our freezing food arrived. We thought next time to just not order on a Friday. So we ordered again, and had to call and check up on the delivery after an hour. Food finally arrived, and one of the drinks was missing. We finally gave it one last shot today, and after an hour and a half, we called, and were promised it would be \\\"any minute.\\\" Twenty minutes later, still nothing. I finally called after almost two hours to cancel the order. The driver arrived in the parking lot shortly after, but who would want to eat the freezing food he had with him. Never, ever again. We will be finding somewhere else to order for our office. I put the menu back up in the break room with a note to warn anyone else off.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Pile'em up Bob's is another spot that's been around forever.  They've changed over years as far as management as the original owner was known to 'pile' your plate up with food to the point that it would barely close if it closed at all.  They're known for the burgers and fish, but they also sell breakfast food, subs, hot dogs, gizzards and the usual artery clogging foods.  I was sad to see that the new owners use what seem to be frozen burgers now but the original owner made the real deal homemade burgers from ground meat.  The food is still good and the portions though not as huge as before, is still quite a bit of food.  It is completely take out only and they do take debit cards($5.00 minimum).  \\n\\nAs an fyi, if you're fearful of going to the hood this may not be the spot for you.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Honestly, it's all pretty much hype. I like the NYC one, but there was at least an hour wait at this one, and we didn't have 3 hours to spend at an ice cream shop. So we got some things from the \\\"take out\\\" window. Which is ridiculously limited in choices. The ice cream itself is fine, but so is Dairy Queen. Definitely won't waste my time there if I'm ever back in Vegas.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This review is only for Breakfast.\\n\\nWe ended up getting breakfast here twice as we were staying at the Wynn. I am not a huge fan of buffets as I dont think that hot food can taste like it was meant to be if it sits out for a while (especially eggs). However, the Wynn Buffet is the best of the bunch on the strip (for breakfast)\\n\\nThe selection of entrees, eggs and desert is vast. You are likely going \\nto eat more than you should and regret your decesion on your way out. We did !\\n\\nAnywho, you are on vacation and dont have to work after eating here.....so when in Rome :)\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: One of my favorite pizza places!!! I usually get the white pizza with pepperoni. Very simply but delicious. I'm not a fan of red sauce so I'm glad this place offers the white sauce for the pizza. I also order the Cesar salad i love how theirs taste because the lettuce is always chilled makes the salad taste so much better. I live in California and before we leave Las Vegas we always order a pizza to go for the road.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Disappointed!\\n\\nThis place takes the high art and craftsmanship of making a Neapolitan pizza and reduces it to dispassionate assembly line fast food trash.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Its a community college :/\\n\\nI'm taking CHM I, Bio I, Ballet I this semester.\\n\\nAcademic advising waits: the last 3 times I was there:  2-3 hours long.\\n\\nThe lectures are done in decent rooms.\\n\\nThe labs can use some improvement.\\n\\nSchool Policy:\\nrely on your own resources and go talk to your instructor first.\\n(make a list)\\nand THEN they can follow up with a formal complaint if it is not resolved.\\n\\nInstructor capability: three stars on average.\\n\\nChem: Llako... recommended.\\nBio: Scott Erickson...fairly new, communication and organization needs improvement.\\nChem lab: Indu Mishra... difficult to understand/ follow, but very intelligent.\\nBallet I: Sonia Valle... highly recommended.

He even made room in his schedule, so we prepared to give him a hefty tip for his courtesy. He spoke to my girlfriend on the phone, but I was the only one home when he dropped by. After figuring out that I wasn't the one he had spoken to, he thrust the modem and cable box into my arms, and claimed that the deal was that we would set it up ourselves. We never, ever, claimed we would set it up ourselves, and on the phone he made it sound like he was going to be doing us a huge favor. Well, thanks for nothing Brett, and I'm going to use the tip you were supposed to receive to buy my coffee this week. \\n\\nI guess we had too much faith in these guys, even though Cox already has a reputation for having crappy customer service.

It took forever. I stood outside wondering...ok, not wondering, more like stumbling...when the hell they were going to \\\"take care of it\\\" and let us in the VIP! Oh yeah-there is something you should know about this club. It has two floors of VIP, so you can be awesome sauce for one and smelly shit for the other. They also don't let you give lapdances on the couches downstairs (so what the HELL are they doing there?!), and that killed even the buzz I had which is weird because I was pretty fucking hammered.\\n\\nOne of their \\\"waitresses\\\" looked like an even cheaper version of Tila Tequila. Ew. (I'll love you Dani!!!)\\n\\nThere was NO dance floor...so again, why can't I give a lapdance to my NOW EX boyfriend?!?! \\n\\nAt least the party I was with had money to buy the bottle service. Also, they had full length mirrors I couldn't stop looking at myself in.\\n\\nSummary: You want to get cheated on? Totally take your boyfriend here. Just make sure you don't go to bed at 3am, wake up at 7, spend 18 dollars on a pack of cigarettes and a lighter and proceed to tell your journal that maybe you really are in love with him and its totally something you can get passed until you crawl back into bed with him and ask him to talk to you and suddenly next thing you know he told you to pack up get out and you're flights delayed while he trys to find a computer with internet to take you off his myspace page.\\n\\nNo, I'm not bitter--why do you ask?\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Okay.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I've gone to Honey Bears now twice.

The ambiance is simple, understated, casual elegance and cozy. \\n\\nThe menu has traditional French specialities, such as Foie Gras for appetizer, and mains like Duck l'Orange, Veal, and even Rabbit. There are a few other mediterranean infuences like Canelloni and Carpaccio from Italy and  Paella from Spain, and they have several seafood selections like more than one salmon and a trout dish, as well as other popular meat favorites.\\n\\nThey have a very affordable 3 course daily  evening special, with appetizer, main and dessert for under $24 CAD (under $20 USD at today's exchange) and most of the entrees a la carte are $18 - $24 CAD,with appetizers in the $6 - $10 CAD range.  They have an adequate wine selection appropriate for their food offerings. \\n\\nService is very attentive, with the owner/manager  providing personalized suggestions and service. \\n\\nThis is mostly a hidden, affordable gem for locals, but if you are ever in Longueuil or along the south shore of Montreal, this would be an excellent, affordable choice for good local French food.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: My favorite place.

We chose Bally's because the rooms had been comped by Total Rewards, and the location on the strip is good.\\n\\nThe pros on staying at Bally's:\\n\\n1. Easy access to other properties: Paris, Caesars, Bellagio, Cromwell, Tropicana.\\n2. The room was comped, can't complain about that!\\n3. Staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.\\n\\nThe cons:\\n\\n1. Our keys did not work the first time we tried to use them.  We had to have security let us into the room for the first time and get re-keyed.\\n2. There was some miscommunication when it came to credit-card holds and pre-authorizations.  When we booked the room we were told that the pre-auth was $100.  As it turns out, it was $100 per night, which for us, was $300.  Additionally, because my boyfriend asked that I have charging privileges, they authorized an additional $300, plus some other charges we did not authorize.  We were able to get it straightened out with the front desk, but an up-front explanation would have been better and led to less frustration on our part.\\n\\nThat's really it... other than that, it's a place to sleep and shower.  I did enjoy gambling there, the dealers and pit bosses were friendly and the casino was spacious.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: The food takes SUPER long to be served.

Tried to Mousse for the first time... Wow.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have no idea how this place has such good reviews. I came here with my bf recently and once we entered we weren't greeted for a while. We went to the cashier and asked him if we just sit anywhere and he looked at us like we should've known that already. \\n\\nHe gave us our menus which was your generic \\\"vegan\\\" menu with wraps, paninis, salads, and a minuscule variety of anything else.  We opted for pasta that had fake meat and avocado in it. We got fries with cheese and tomatoes for our appetizer. The pasta came with a very bitter side salad. And drinks? We just stuck to water, there was no way we were paying for their ridiculously priced drinks. \\n\\nThe whole time it seemed like the server/cashier guy was mad at us. He kind of sighed when we only ordered one dish and every time we looked at him he wasn't smiling, unless he was talking to a regular. \\n\\nThe bitter salad came after 10 minutes. 20 minutes after that we still didn't have our food, not even the fries. We noticed a couple sitting in front of us that was already there when we got in; They looked like they were getting antsy and nothing was on their table yet. The girl went up to the cashier to ask her how much longer they're going to have to wait since it looked like they weren't doing anything in their kitchen, and he told her it won't be much longer. THEN you see them start making their sandwich and chickn nuggets. They got their tiny plate of chicken nuggets along with their sandwich and boy did they look mad! I would've been mad too if it took them almost an hour to bring out a sandwich and 5 nuggets. \\n\\nAbout 40 minutes into waiting we got our fries and pasta. \\n\\nWow, those fries were disgusting! You can totally tell how dried out and gross they must've been by the pictures I provided. It was like they chopped some potatoes,sprinkled cheese on top and left them in the oven to burn. Then took them out and sprinkled a few pieces of tomato on it. If I had my eyes closed while eating this I probably would've thought it was cardboard that a homeless person wrote on. \\n\\nThe pasta....was even worse. It tasted spoiled, like they went and left it in someone's car for a day, then took it back inside and put some fresh avocado on it. It was just sour and very bland. The fake meat on it tasted just like the pasta, it added no flavor. The only thing it added to the dish was the artificial appearance of it looking good. \\n\\nIt really bugs me when \\\"Vegan\\\" places stick to serving bland food and charging more money for it just because it has the title of being Vegan. Considering I've gone to many other REAL vegan joints, I can safely say that this place deserves one star. Their fake meat has absolutely no flavor or any texture that makes it seem real at all. \\n\\nJust go to an asian restaurant and order lots of flavorful vegan selections for half the price.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Cheese curds were good but don't eat too much because you'll have a tummy ache afterwards.

{"prompt": "Sentence: Gas service is good here as prices are less than the surrounding locations; unfortunately, service in the store is sadly lacking.\\n\\nWalking into the store, sometimes there is a security person who is watching.  Not sure what they are watching, as half of the folks walk out without having their bags or receipts checked, while the other half are asked for their receipts and to take their items out of the bags to verify the items in the bags are on the receipts.  \\n\\nThe store has more groceries and other items than the Frys at Southern and Mill; it carries less inventory than the location at McClintock and Baseline.  For some reason, there is a greater security presence here than either of the other two stores.  In shopping morning and evening, the number of cashiers varies widely...from more than 5 earlier in the day to none later in the day.\\n\\nWhen I am checking out, I like personal service instead of the self-checkout.  It is easier to check out with someone behind the register instead of relying on the computer.\\n\\nI guess I am going to have to treat all Frys stores the same way...they need to EARN my business.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Finally checked this place out during the Melrose Street Fair last week.  The selection is UNBELIEVABLE!  I even told them I would work for free on weekends!  Like High Fidelity!\\nThere is vinyl.  Lots of vinyl.  I wish I still have my record player.  That's right.  I don't say turntable :P  I'm old skool.\\nThe CD collection was awesome!  Went there with a male friend, same age as I am.  We kept shouting out \\\"Holy crap, The Tubes!\\\"  And \\\"OMG they have Black Flag!\\\"\\nPrices are very reasonable.  Staff is super-friendly.\\nGO THERE!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: One word describe my experience horrible!!! Came here for the first time, but everyone knows what senior frogs is. \\n\\nWe came in after a little wait which is to be expected, we were showed to our table which was still dirty, after it being cleaned we waited for our server for 20 mins we should have left but we had a coupon for drinks. \\n\\nOur sever Emmanuelle gave the drinks to wrong table, after noticing and people placing straws in the drinks he takes them off the table and gives them to us. Gross!!!We asked for new drinks, and he got upset. Our food was cold, and our sever never checked on us. When we tried to get his attention he told us we had to wait. We were the only table that didn't get balloons, when we mentioned it we were told we can get the ones behind the table.  \\n\\nWhat!! I get that it's popular but what about customer service?? This place has absolutely none, the manager should take a good look at their management skills, and the team they have under them. I would never go to this location again.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Very much enjoyed the croissant and apple fritter my wife and I shared. Add in a bottle of apple juice and it cost just over $6.00. The bakery had a wide selection of other pastries, tarts, sandwiches and bagels. Warm atmosphere and very friendly and attentive service.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I moved here from Washington DC a year ago. Since the move it's been hard to find a store with everything that I would need from a metaphyiscal standpoint. However,  my first love is Tarot. And, this store has an acceptable catalog of Tarot cards.   I can honestly say that I frequent this spot once a month... or at worst once every two months only because the drive is so far (I live in Ahwatukee).  The staff is always kind, knowledgeable, and I even hear they have some great events throughout the week.  Although I wish they carried more Jewelry (Amulets and Talismans) they have far more than most in the area. They also  have plenty of oils and crystals for those types of manifestations.. \\n\\n\\nI would wish for more candles ...but then perhaps I am just being greedy. Lol\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We stayed here for one day. We had originally booked two days but our motorhome broke down about 100 miles from Vegas. We still had to pay for both nights in full ($150.00+). We payed for an upgraded site. The description said closer to the pool and not along the road. We were one row off the road and way away from the pool. The place is really just a parking lot with hook-ups. There's almost no trees unless you pay a small fortune for one of the few sites with one. I don't think you even need reservations since they were nowhere near full on the Saturday night in July when we were there. The staff was very friendly and the location was great since we didn't have transportation other than our motorhome.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I've been searching for NY pizza now for four years and Tony's wins the prize, hands down. Slices twice the size in NY and ambiance feels like your home with the giant NY subway maps on the wall. And, oh yeah, the pizza is superb.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Really? 4 stars!!??? This place was AWFUL. I love Afghani/Persian/Mediterranean/etc, but the food here is completely uninspired, cafeteria-grade slop, from start to finish. Usually Yelp has some fairly reliable reviews, but the 8 or so for this place were just completely off base. Hummus was fine, the only edible thing ordered. Fried eggplant appetizer was lacking is both flavor and ingenuity -- all I could taste was oil. Lamb kabobs -- the best stateside, according to one delusional reviewer -- just an utter joke. 5 tiny pieces of dry, overcooked and tasteless lamb, one of which was all cartilage. The accompanying salad was an Albertson's-grade ruffage melange. The other lamb rice dish was better, at least not super tough or bland, and the rice was alright, but the lentils were not cooked--like at all. I know restaurants have off nights, but any restaurant worth its salt should come through with at least one or two solid dishes. I wouldn't come within shitting distance of this place ever again. To y'all believers out there, all I can say is:\\n\\nWTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!? WTF!?

You can get anything from super sweet, salty, spicy, and even savory. \\n\\nI selected a box of eight to share with the man(four types, one for each of us) at about $2 a pop. There were many great flavors, and I could have easily dropped a wad of cash and gotten the uber-large box...if I was spending someone else's money. Because I was using my own, however, I chose the  Chai Ganache and Fromage de Bleu(bleu cheese and balsamic vinegar, very interesting) which  were seasonal(the fall selection was being released the next day), and Gingered Macadamia Nut and Caribbean Fire were among the mainstays. I wanted to get a wide variety, and I was impressed. They were tasty and beautiful. \\n\\nI was also given a sample of the cider caramel that was in the fall collection--and I'll be back soon to snatch some of THOSE. Yummy.\\n\\nI only wish they had a few more hard core chocolate chocolates. You know, the stuff for cocoa lovers who mean business. \\n\\nHeads up--save the gorgeous box, you get 10% off if you bring it back to refill.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This hotel is just ok. The price was pretty cheap which is their main plus. Location-wise, it is a bit far from old town, latin quarter, etc but the subway station is about a 5 minute walk. Staff is friendly enough, rooms are dated but adequate. The TV's were very old and were spotty in their use. The parking garage is underground and a bit shady. You also have to switch elevators while going from the garage to the hotel elevators. Our breakfast was included, but I would not have paid the $12 extra if it wasn't. It included the usual cereals, juice/milk/coffee, egg/sausage, some breads/croissants (found a random chocolate one in there?), yogurt, and canned fruit. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything memorable either. If you're on a budget, stay here. If not, stay somewhere closer downtown.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Unfortunately, they do not accept American Express and this is my card of choice!  Dissappointing....especially when I had a guest with me and I was suppose to pick up the tab....then to find out they do not accept the card.  My guest and I had to scrape together cash.  Ugh.  Also, 2 other comments.....the wait staff was 'standing around alot when tables were in need of cleaning---and the boss was in the restaurant!  Second, their street tacos were hard as a rock.  Not sure if they are using stale tortillas or they nuke them and let them sit til the contents are ready---so by the time it is served the shell is very very tough.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place is great, food is great, staff is great.\\nBeen there several times and each visit everything is top notch.\\nSteak, BBQ, band, service.\\nLove the view too!!!!!\\nOh and yes don't forget the cotton candy!!!!\\nOh and the boots, boot mugs and boot shot glasses, yes, yes.\\nAnyone visiting Phoenix needs to see the view also.\\n\\nI personally go back often and take visitors and Friends each time.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Food was good but the service was horrible especially the lady with short hair. ( oldest one )She was asking me how many I said 3 but 1 more is coming then she just walk away without saying anything and go put reserved sign on the table then she just disappeared I thought she would comeback and sit me down but she was doing something in the kitchen and I've been waiting for 20 mins until I can't wait anymore I walked to her and asked can I sit down she said we have a reservation wtf????!!!??u should have told me something ??? And I saw her shake her head ?? What did I do wrong?? She was so rude and unprofessional at all then I waited for another 5 mins she sat me down on the table that put reserved sign?!!?! Who the hell reserved so now I knew she fucking lie then after we ordered they brought out all the food I swear servers never came back and check if everything ok or do we want anything else..........never refill the drinks have to call and waive a hand to her which is I really don't wanna do but seriously damn my cup of water all empty!!!! No wonder why this's place mostly is slow.. Food is super awesome but service is horrible all the times!!!!! If I could find some place that have same quality meats I would never come back here again!!!!!!!!!! \\n\\n\\n\\n0.5star for service not even 1  (to lady short hair)she could hv been better...:-(\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: If you enjoyed jumping on trampolines as a child, this is your place to go as an adult!  And I don't mean just one trampoline here, there are over twenty trampolines - all connected together! So you literally get to jump from one trampoline to another.  And they also have trampolines on the side walls too!  This is your chance to try all those aerial stunts you wanted to try as a kid.  You can jump onto the wall, do a flip and just keep on jumping!  They even offer 3-D Dodgeball and hoops for you to try to fly through.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found myself here on a Sunday night after my friend suggested this idea months before.  Sure, I've done my share of trampoline jumping in someone's backyard.  But this setup, you just can't find in someone's yard.  So, there I was practicing my front and back somersaults.  And sure, I ate it a few times...everyone needs a few good face plants every now and then.  But the idea of just jumping your ass off and getting your heart rate up reminds me of jumping on my bed until it felt like my heart was going to explode.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Open Court Jumping, you can pay by the hour on the hour or half for $8.50/hr.  (At our age, we figure an hour was plenty and it was!  It's gets super tiring jumping!)  On the hour and the half, they blow their whistle reminding those who have finished their session that they time is up.  This is when they make everyone take a mini break on the sides until everyone who is supposed to be off is gone.  And then you can resume to your jumping pleasures!   \\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, sure...I did ask my friend if we were the oldest ones there and we were.  But so what?!  We had a fabulous time nonetheless and agreed that it would have made a fantastic date spot!  See if you can drag a bunch of your friends along with you.  I'm sure it'll make it that much more fun! \\r\\n\\r\\nSide note: With no lockers, I suggest you leave mostly everything in your car or at home (hotel).  You can leave your keys/wallet at the front, but it gets jumbled up with everyone else's keys/wallets.  Bring water, Gatorade, etc. because you will need it!  And most likely you'll feel the need to shower right afterwards.  This is a serious workout!  Let me know if you try it out!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I really liked the burger, get's 4 stars. Quality meat, veggies, good cheese, cooked right.  The fries were good too.  But $11.30 for the combo, that seems a bit expensive to me.  Thus, 3 stars.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Food is average, I think it depends on what you get.  There was only 1 other table there eating other then us.  I had the beef barley soup which was pretty good, I had the beef tips (which were fatty & tough) with the creamy mashed potatoes (which were very dense and thick) and the side of spinach (which was good and had garlic in it).   Portion size was good.  My meal was $12.99 a little pricey for the quality that was served.\\n\\nI'd go back but I would definitely try something else.\\n\\nService was nice nothing great and certainly wasn't bad.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Okay so I will let you know up front that I'm an old guy at over 50 and I will tell you that this is the most fun a person can have for their buck!  Especially  in Vegas.  The staff was friendly and courteous and had us watch a quick video outlining the workings of the carts and safety rules.  You get a lap or so to get used to the kart at a slower pace and then they turn the speed on full blast.  Then, hold on to your hats because going 45mph on a small kart feels more like 100mph this close to the ground!  I saw a group before us enjoy the race with their kids.  Where else can one go and have this kind of fun with your kids?  Not many places.  Like I said before, for what you pay for a meal in this town you get a full course of absolute fun and thrills.  Don't forget to check in on Facebook and redeem your free Monster drink!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Overpriced. Tiny dishes.. Food was cold. Avoid at all costs.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Bearing in mind the slating I've given George Street in general, I'll put myself down for a \\\"pleasantly surprised\\\" vote with regards to the Candybar. It wasn't particularly great or memorable, but I did quite enjoy my time here.\\n\\nThe decor is equal parts trendy and tacky, if a bit less over the top than other George street joints, making it feel a bit more relaxed than some of it's neighbours. It's still very much in pursuit of the beautiful people, though the fact that they had \\\"all food under a fiver\\\" menus and a laughably easy pub quiz going, suggests that a less fabulous crowd is also welcome, at least during the week.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu was fairly rudimentary and full of the cosmos and French Martinis that more serious cocktail bars tend not to do anymore. I got the impression though that that's what they're trying for here, and the general lack of pretence in the atmosphere was quite refreshing. Even the staff were quite courteous and friendly, a trait practically unheard of round here.\\n\\nI'd probably steer away from the food, the low prices and fairly unappetising selection told me pretty much everything I needed. A goats cheese and red pepper wrap would have to be seriously cheap for me to even consider nibbling at it, and everything else was similarly mediocre looking.\\n\\nIt has it's faults, and they're fairly numerous, but to be fair I did find this quite a nice and relaxing bar to while away an hour or so. Due to it's location I expected to hate it, but it's not bad at all. Not sure If I'd feel the same on a Saturday night though.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: GREAT FOOD! Ok drinks, but if you like beer they have a very large selection.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I decided to go to Raffles on the recommendation of a friend.  She told me to try the Stuffed Banana Pecan French Toast...good as a concept, not so good in practice.  When I got it, it was cold (okay...maybe lukewarm, but I was hungry and I had places I needed to be and didn't have time to send it back or I would have.)  One side was burnt, as in black.  How they didn't notice this when they artfully arranged it on my plate is beyond me.  Think...burnt toast and bananas.  I didn't finish it all, because honestly I didn't feel it was that great.  Later that night me and the man were hungry and decided to try out House of Blues also in Mandalay Bay, but it was closed.  It was late, we were hungry and didn't want to go searching. Raffles was a convenient choice for us, although eating in the same place twice in one day while in Vegas was really unaplealing to me.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to give a  place a second chance, I am not going to write a place off wihen I have one bad experience.  I work in a restaurant myself, I know, not every dining experience is going to be great, if you want that, then stay home.  So despite my lackluster breakfast, I thought okay I am going to give this another shot.   \\n\\nWe perused the menu and decided okay for a late dinner this might be okay.  Well they have a late night menu, which is NOT displayed (Late being like 10:30 pm) and so the items we wanted were not available.  Not cool, Raffles, not cool.  I love breakfast food, so I decided I would try an omelet, well done, as in not runny.  It was overdone, rubbery, dry and strangly runny on the inside.  The hash brown potatoes, were gross...and I love potatoes!  He had a burger, he liked it.  He also ordered a milkshake, on a scale of 1-10 he gave it a 6.  We did however order the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and we were practically fighting over who got to lick the bowl.  It was really good.\\n\\nPersonally I just think this is overpriced dressed up diner food.  \\n\\nOur server though, Virginia was a little slow (But we were not her ONLY table, she did get a party in addiition to us and other tables, so we can't fault her too much for that.)  And she made up for it with her great sense of humor.  In fact she was probably the best part of our experience.\\n\\nWill I go to Raffles again?  No.\\nWill I recommend it to anyone? No.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: everyone has their own story of how/what leads them to bikram.  while i cannot make comparisons to other bikram studios my experience is worth reading/taking into consideration when/if choosing if byi is the place for you.  the answer:  try this place just once (it's affordable).  also, instructors are personable, nurturing and engaging.  Various classes throughout the day allow you to make the practice part of your life as often as you aim for.  indeed it is true what byi's instructors preach:  the hardest part of the class is showing up!  i appreciate this studio so much more than words convey.   even though bikram is done on a group level you internalize the ritual of getting ready for class, being present in class, even leaving class as personal.  i don't mind at all the notifications of other services and class times on holidays during savasana (byi offered classes on Easter Sunday - integral to bikramettes and their 30 day challenges) arriving to class with \\\"spare\\\" time to sit and lounge is not in the cards for me so it is during class time that i'm brought up to speed on what other programs or additional classes i may benefit from.  not once have i ever received the message as an infomercial as the message is short and brief between postures.   I appreciate the honor system when on occasion i've not prepared for class and ran low of hydration.  those few times i'm able to consume first pay later without feeling \\\"marked\\\" or hounded to bring in payment.  just hazarding a guess but IF byi had more room to develop the studio in terms of space then andrea probably would do so.  i'm ok with the quaintness of bathroom space.  if made too spacious a waiting area then it might take away from the focus which is to get in the classroom, set up bikram camp and to wait for it!  byi is functional/practical for the bikrami's wanting yoga.  i need space in the classroom, the diverse personalities of instruction (no microphone please) and consistency in operation. BYI is this place.   Namaste.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Wow, I'm reviewing a strip club...\\n\\nA friend of ours made us go to the Velvet Lion since he was hooking us up with a party bus for pretty much the weekend.  The club itself is nice.  It has a nice decor and it's clean with comfy long sofas.\\n\\nThis is so mean but the girls are not attractive whatsoever, especially for a Saturday night.  When we walked in the door, the girl on the main stage looked like she was 5 months pregnant, her belly was so big.  The girl after her was so skinny, in a not cute way.  I'm not hating.  Even the guys in our group were like eww.  And the fell on the stage and ate sh*t.  My friend did get a lap dance from a girl with really nice long legs.  And we also chatted with this girl that had a great, athletic body.  Most athletic body I've ever seen on a stripper in my life (not that I've seen that many strippers).  \\n\\nI absolutely wouldn't go here again unless I absolutely had to i.e. used the limo service to go somewhere else and had to stop by Velvet Lion as justification.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This restaurant was a great find! We love Indian cuisine and Tamba did not disappoint. The food was very good with subtle and distinctive flavor. The service was gracious and accommodating. And the quiet atmosphere was a great break from the hectic Strip. Value is excellent.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I've been to many different Morton's before and I've got to say this is probably the worst one. We went here for new years, my wife's filet wasn't cooked right and mine was over done. They sent it back and it came back acceptable, but what really bothered us was some supposedly famous person was being extremely loud and annoying. It got so bad that we had to move to another table, the waiter mentioned that they couldn't ask him to leave because he was a personal friend of the owner. Well he ended up fighting with several other guests whom all ended up leaving.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This is one of the few places in Vegas I've taken my car to more than once.  They were perfectly fine and several of their guys would take the time to show me what was going on if they recommended a repair.\\n\\nIn the last year something has happened.  A couple of their guys are outright rude, and service has gone down the toilet.  What should have been an overnight repair issue became a three day without my car ordeal and when I got it back, it wasn't even done and I had to bring it back to force them to finish the fix and not only was their manager rude about it, he lied to me about how long it would take.\\n\\nToday I took my car in and there is a repair that I was told would take two hours.  I told them to go ahead and fix it, the guy on the phone responded \\\"okay.\\\"  Three hours later I call to see if it's ready and it is not.  They guy \\\"wasn't sure\\\" whether I wanted the fix or not.  He then lied to me about trying to call me back to verify whether I wanted the problem fixed.  Now, my car is stuck there overnight *again* for what should have been done and in my hands two hours ago.\\n\\nI will not go back there again.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Best deal in the whole valley. $11 and I get a super car wash with pre-scrubbing and towel drying and tire treatment. The guys are very professional and nice. I've spent four times this price for a \\\"detailed\\\" wash that wasn't half as good. Plus, they're environmentally friendly. Love this place!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Avoid us or American airline if you can.  They will make u to check in even your 1 piece carry on :((.  And the staffs were very rude and aggressive when I politely asked can I check if there is room for my small bag bc it was raining and I don't wanna check in my unlocked bag...They said all space is filled, but when I walked in to the airplane, there was so manyyyyy space left to store....They still can store another 10 carries on but.... Very disappointed experienced and it's my first time flying w them probably also the last time.\\n\\nThe aircraft temperature was really cold, and there was no inflight blankets :((....it's a 4 hours ride but no snacks except water and soft drink.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: You want real pizza by the slice NY style the Due Amici is the only place in the area even worth a stop.   Was very happy when I found this place and try and eat there at least once a week.    It even comes with a bit of Northern attitude which some can take or leave but it always makes me laugh a bit.\\n\\n\\nTheir cannolis are amazing too I definitely think you should get em when they put em out fresh.  \\n\\nMy only complaint is no delivery but it only takes me a few minutes to get there and home so no biggie.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Didn't have much time before they closed.. or should I say the kitchen closed.  My gps kept saying I was passing it, but I could not see it from the street (passed it from both directions).  I called, spoke with Chrissie or Kristy, who gave excellent directions.  It's located in the Atherton Mill parking lot where there are a bunch of other restaurants - closest is Ice House and is located next to/across from the Farmer's Market.  Now that I know where it is, I will be sure to not get lost and get there when the kitchen is still open to enjoy a full meal.\\n\\nApparently the location changed recently and some of their offerings are no more, such as the alkaline water which was a bummer.. but they have carbon filtered water, which i'm not familiar with.. have to research that one.  \\n\\nPeople hang out and lounge even after the kitchen is closed.. it's a really lax, hip, artsy, healthy atmosphere.. good vibes!  People were super helpful and approachable.  People just came right up to me and spoke, which was really nice.  Prices are super high though.. i've never in my life purchased a pint? (approximately) of fresh juice for over $10.. that is insane!  but.. I wanted to give them a shot and support their local business.. all organic and vegetarian.  I chose the juice with beets, kale, spinach, orange, lemon, ginger and... not sure if i'm forgetting something or not.  I'll be drinking it tomorrow at work.  Never had beets before, so it should be an interesting experience.  Will update more later.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: When they are too busy flirting with the girls in the news stand next door to keep their regular coffee fresh, they fail.\\n\\nOnly reason they don't get a 1 star is that my wife's drink was made okay. BUT, the regular bold blend was old and cold... Seriously, all you have to do is brew a fresh pot every half hour or so!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This is a beautiful complex! Office manager and staff are great and respond to issues and questions quickly and accordingly.

Kudos to Ashleh and Erin except on this last occasion during the evening. We brought clients in and one brought his wife and they loved the food and servers EXCEPT the pervert manager justin (I used lower case cause he acted like a a minor who cannot control himself) who kept looking down our \\\"future client's wife's breast\\\" this is ridiculous and to top it off he hit on her! Well this upset the husband and they will never go back to any hooters nor will we and we generate ALOT of business for the owner of this location! \\n\\nFYI if he does this to customers who are married imagine what he does during business hours. If the owner wants to speak to our company he can BUT we will NOT take this review down. I debated about giving it a five star based on the previous servers; however, this manager needs to be reviewed on his conduct and probably more. I have been in business for 20 years and never witnessed this BEHAVIOR to a customer and then in front of the spouse? He is a walking liability.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: The waffles have bacon in them.\\n\\nDid you read that? THE WAFFLES. HAVE. BACON IN THEM. What the crap?!\\n\\nThis place was so very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. A must try at least ONCE whenever you got Vegas. The portions are huge and that is an understatement. I would recommend sharing a meal with a friend.\\n\\nI got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedicts and a friend got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles...heaven.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Its an Airport, it is okay but not the speediest to get out of.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Shockingly disappointed!  We went to SDC last night for dinner.  Good meal as usual until it came to the bill.  It would appear as though the Spotted Donkey now has a mandatory 20% gratuity for a party of 5 or more.  This came as a bit of a surprise even though we typically tip 18%-20% for their good service.  What was really surprising was that our \\\"party of 5\\\" consisted of 3 adults, a 4 year old and a 20 month old.  What was a satisfying meal of a sudden became marginal.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: A big, beautiful museum in a gorgeously renovated historic building: what's not to love? The permanent collection and most of the rotating exhibitions are totally free, and there's usually one paid exhibit on at any given time, as well. \\n\\nCurrently one of the free exhibitions is the BP Portrait Prize, which is always one of the highlights of the year for those of us who love contemporary portrait painting (and if you don't, come on, why are you bothering to read a review of a portrait museum at all?).\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Arrived at Excalibur at 4am with a 2 year old who was very fussy and tired as a last resort, cheap room until we had to check in to the Mandalay the next day. When we first arrived, 2 agents were both with different large families who were complaining about something. I waited in line for *45* minutes along with many other frustrated people. There were two \\\"managers\\\" on duty, or whatever they were just standing there looking like idiots. When we would ask them for help, keep in mind some people were just asking for new keys because they wouldn't work, they put us back in line and didn't apologize for anything. As I finally came up to the counter, the woman gave me a bitchy look as I asked her if she had any half day or special rates, (we were staying for 3 hours) and she snapped at me! THE RATE IS 80 DOLLARS, IF YOU WANT TO GET A CHEAPER RATE, BOOK AT HOTELS.COM. So my fiance went and called hotels.com, and after being on hold with them, walked back and was told that they don't do same day reservations since it was before 3 am. Went to sit back down and my daughter was screaming at the top of her lungs and throwing a fit. They kept staring at me, and did not care to help, after everyone had ending up walking away because of the wait. I am not impressed at all. I can appreciate the atmosphere of the Excalibur, however the customer service is terrible, and they should be ashamed that they would ever treat guests that way.\\n\\nVery unprofessional.

I had ordered a Grilled Vegetable Wrap that came with amazing fresh daikon fries along with a Leafy Green Berry Blast Smoothie and my husband ordered a Vegan Burger along with Delicious Tofu Fries with a Wellness Drink Smoothie.  Everything we had ordered was so tastey.  So we went again the very next day and I had ordered the same thing and my husband ordered the Vegan Pizza and Carrot Juice.  The smoothies are seriously really healthy and so refreshing!  We are not Vegans but wanted to try something different and healthier.  The cafe is set up very nicely with TVs.  The place is next to the gym LVAC where you will see a lot of fit people coming to eat after the gym, also we saw people on their laptops as well.  I give it 4 stars because the prices are pretty expensive.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: My family and I have been coming to Lorenzo's since they opened.  So, why only 3 stars?  After all of these years, I finally think I can write a justified review.  First I want to say that we love the Grandma's Pie..best in the city or maybe anywhere else.  If you notice, all of the previous reviews talk about the pizza.  So, I am going to talk about what they are not taking about..First - the wine is horrible.  I've suggested many times that they get better tasting wine and up their price.  Right now they charge $5 a glass for the worst tasting wine in the world.  It's gotten to the point, that if I'm in the mood for a drink with my pizza, I'm going to one of the other Ballantyne restaurants to have a good drink with dinner. Tonight we ordered the house salad.  Thinking back on the house salads recently, the tomatoes are not ripe and the lettuce is iceberg that is more white than green.  My son likes the kids spaghetti and meatball (one meatball), which is a good size for the child.  He also likes garlic knots.  These are not knots, they are pull apart rolls that have garlic and butter on them.  However, the sauce that comes with the garlic \\\"knots\\\" is very good.  Tonight we ordered the special, baked ziti with eggplant.  Unfortunately, while the ziti and eggplant may have tasted good..it was hard to tell since it was drenched in tomato sauce and one huge slab of mozzarella cheese.  The sauce was just ok and tasted like it was out of a jar with no seasoning.  How can you make a good sauce to go with the \\\"knots\\\" and not have good sauce on the ziti.  Thinking back to other entrees we have had, they were also drenched in sauce that could have been much tastier. We also had ordered the meatball parm sub.  This was done very nice - 6 medium size meatballs on a sweet soft roll.  So, to sum it up..if you are looking for a good pizza head to Lorenzos, but you'd better not want to have a good drink to go  a log with it..Just stick to pizza at Lorenzo's.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Terrible, tasteless food\\nChicken Asiago sandwich was bland, dry, tasteless.\\nChocolate ice cream cup melted\\nFrench fries over salted and cold\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Not a bad place, but I would go for a seat inside the restaurant.\\n\\nI visited Il Fornaio with a group of seven who were in from out of town.  For some reason they really wanted to sit on the \\\"patio\\\" which is really just the area outside of the main restaurant right next to the slot machines.  As you can imagine that made for a really loud meal and the main thing that kept me from rating Il Fornaio any higher.\\n\\nWe were here on a Sunday night, and had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  Like any Italian place, you get plenty of bread with vinegar and oil to tide you over while you decide on what to have.  I went for the margherita pizza, which was more than I could handle.  If I recall correctly it was in the 10-15 dollar range.  Most of the other entrees are a bit more pricey.  The wait staff was friendly but a little too attentive for my taste.  I don't need to be asked every 4 minutes if I'm ok, or have someone reach through my conversation to refill my water that's not even half gone.\\n\\nIf I go back here, I'll definitely get inside seating.

I could hear them in the back laughing it up while I was in the room frantic for my pet and all I hear were obscene language. These people don't care at all for you pet, even the doctor by the name of Baker is a real class act! He has no sympathy and no bed side manner and just treats you like another number. The receptionist with the bob Adriene I believe is over the top on fakeness and acts like she cares and understands what I was going through that night, plus she is very odd. Over all this review is not based on pricing because I would do anything for my pet money is no problem, it's the crappy staff that wear their \\\"I care for your pet\\\" hat like toilet paper stuck to your a$$. Seems this place has a huge turnover rate and staff that is completely incompetent. Do yourself a favor and go to Sonora Veterinary Specialist, they are right down the way on 40th St and Cactus and they are exceptionally better and educated. DON'T waste your time or money on VCA, this place is full of unprofessional slackers that rush you just to get you out and going. Idiots!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Overall, not that impressed. I've only been to one other buffet before, at the Bellagio, and I prefer that one over the Wynn. We went on a Tuesday night, after a long day of hiking at Zion National Park, so we were starving. To be honest, I didn't feel like the buffet was that big. I went back 2 times for a heaping of crab legs & shrimp cocktail, which are the only foods I really enjoyed there. They have some dim sum like dumplings and such at the Chinese food station, which was awful. Most of their cooked fishes were overcooked and not impressive. Their cheese ravioli in their pasta section was good, as was their miso soup.\\n\\nThey have a huge dessert section, but to be honest, none of the desserts really impressed me. One of my dining companions loved their coffee ice cream, as he is a big fan of coffee and it tastes very very strongly of coffee.\\n\\nI would not go to their dinner buffet again. Also, it is very pricy, comes to about $37 with tax per person. A friend of mine said their breakfast buffet was great though, and only $25, so would be willing to try that sometime.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Never had a bad experience.

For those looking, it's on the side near where B of A, Starbucks and is right next to Pizza Hut.  \\n\\nThe one thing I would change is the stark-white tables and chairs. Not a good mix with kids coming in. It seems to be becoming an industry standard with Fro-Yo places and this place is pretty sterile. The neon colored spoons are fun though and there is a wide variety of mix-ins to add to your Fro-Yo if you so desire.\\n\\nA piece of advice--I hope that Razzleberriez will remember--when the snowbirds leave, your best customers are going to be us residents and we have kids so don't forget to appeal and cater to us as well.

Obviously their theme is anything beach and Jimmy Buffet related. It's actually pretty neat on the inside. There's a section of booths that looks like the back of fishing boats. Their music is pumping for the party that's usually going on on their balcony most nights. Not terrible but it's a little distracting. Their margarita menu is large and the two we tried were well mixed. There was a lot of tequila but it didn't detract from the taste. That being said, the alcohol content did sneak up on us and we felt a little tipsy after one drink. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Next we had their chicken volcano nachos. This thing was huge and was clearly meant to serve more than two people. We picked at the plate for almost an hour and still had to take some of it back to our room. Admittedly after the drinks and appetizer we were done so we didn't have any dinner items. If you've never been I'd say give it a try. It's an expierience. However I don't think anyone would be clamoring to get back for another visit.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This place is HORRIBLE!!!\\n\\nInn-Termission Lounge is pretty much a dive bar in every aspect, except for drink prices. As noted in previous reviews, the drink prices would reflect those of an upscale club. Which this dump most definitely is not. As well, it's nearly impossible to get a drink from the bartenders. They will literally look right at you, and completely ignore you at the same time. Once you finally do get served (at one point, it took me 20 minutes to get a beer), it's like they've done you the biggest favor in the world by serving you. \\n\\nI have seen some places use increased drink prices to weed out \\\"riff-raff\\\". But it fails to work here. Countless homeless dregs wandered in and out of the place, right past the doorman. Then they hit total strangers up for a drink. I guess it's OK for them to come in, so long as they ask for drinks and not money? They also brought their dogs into the bar with them-which is a major PLCB violation. I was catching a show in the back room, and noticed a puddle on the floor. At first I thought someone spilled a drink. But then I saw that one of the homeless guys' dogs was squatting and urinating on the floor. Lovely. \\n\\nI like a good dive bar as much as the next guy.

Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.\\n\\nLast night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.\\n\\nI've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  \\n\\n4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. \\n\\nIf you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: reasonably priced with some decent options. Portion sizes were pretty good.

I requested the VIP service and added on the leather conditioning for the seats. I was in one lane and after specifying what wash/extras I wanted, someone else came over and said I could move to another lane where it'd be quicker since nobody was in that one. So I moved lanes and went inside to pay and wait. After I waited to pay (while the cashiers were just sitting in the back talking with each other as a line formed behind me), I noticed that whoever was supposed to be vacuuming my car, was on a phone and kind of glanced in my car while holding the vacuum hose then just shut my door and tossed down the hose. I assumed it was because they were done with that part of the service. \\n\\nThen, after my car went through the automated part of the car wash, I proceeded to wait outside and my car was parked behind 3 other cars to be finished. By the time mine made it to the front and was finishing up, I had been at the car wash for an hour. I've never been at a car wash for an hour! If I had know it'd take that long, I wouldn't have stopped. The times on the cars behind me showed that most had only been there about 15-20min at that point. Then, I asked about the trunk/storage area in the SUV, if it should have been vacuumed or not. The guy working on my car didn't know but the guy working on the car behind mine told him it should have been- that the whole car gets vacuumed. Well, it wasn't so he took a little blower to try to get the stuff out of the storage/trunk area and it didn't work very well. I also noticed that the windows/windshield weren't cleaned very well and I had black stuff on my rims after they \\\"cleaned\\\" them. And they only vacuumed the driver's floor mat- no place else in the car was vacuumed! Also the cup holders weren't wiped out. I didn't bring it to anyone's attention besides the two mentioned because I had already been there an hour and was just wanting to get out of there! Plus, I saw their \\\"answer\\\" for vacuuming my car that didn't work so I still wouldn't have been happy until they used a real vacuum on it. Will NEVER return!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Thank God for tourists and trendy people wanting trendy cupcakes. Without either this place would flop!!!\\n\\nI always see a line out the door and figured that Sprinkles cupcakes HAD to be amazing. I live right down the street and find myself walking by quite often, but after 3 visits and 3 mediocre cupcakes I realized why there is always a 15 minute wait; the teenagers that work behind the counter are ill trained and take longer to put a cupcake in a box, than it does Starbucks to make a complex specialty coffee.\\n\\nTo top it off, each time I visited, the overprices cupcakes were hardly stocked and I had to settle for my second choice. The cakes tasted decent but were a touch dry. \\nFun to look at but not much more.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love cupcakes as much as the next 30's something hipster yuppie, but had it not been for an extraordinary location with a high volume of tourist based pedestrian traffic, Sprinkles would not be making it based on the quality of their cupcakes. It is a good thing for them that everyone that walks by this location is transient. The idea is great but this company would not survive on local business alone.\\n\\nThe owners are very fortunate that they have been able to ride the coattails of other trendy and worthy cupcake companies. Had the cupcake trend not existed before Sprinkles opened, they surely would not have started the trend themselves, and would have fizzed out within months of opening\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I was nervous when we got there because the French place next to it was packed and this place was pretty empty.

The haircut came off without a hitch, #1 buzz all over, but the shave was a bit lacking.\\n\\nHonestly I felt like he was a bit rushed during the shave and I didn't come away as smooth as I thought I should. When I get home there was visible stubble and several longer hairs that he'd missed all together. I had to break out my razor and finish up the job he'd started when I got home.\\n\\nI would return for a haircut, clipper cut's aren't tough, but I would hesitate to get a shave from the same gentleman in the future. For $40 for a shave and a haircut I think you should come away smooth as a baby's butt and not look like you have trucker stubble in patches on your face and neck.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: First, I have been a customer of Tags since the 59 ave and Bell restaurant opened.  I have seen the evolution of this family owned restaurant and then their expansion in opening two other Tags in the valley.  The poor rating I have to unfortunately give Tags has not been my experience until recently, say the past year or so.  Much of their problem I think can be reduced to poor managment and consequently poor oversight and customer service.  The past three experiences I have had at Tags have left me wondering if I will return again.  On one occasion I ordered a margarita and was delivered what is called a tag margarita, something that was not what I wanted nor ordered.  The waitress told me that this particular drink was the only type of margarita they offered, for 8.95.  I got the impression, rightly or wrongly that this was an attempt by the waitress to pad the bill.  I later went to the bar and asked the barmaid if they did in fact make a traditional margarita to which she told me they did.  On this particular occasion I ordered their Romano Chicken dish and was served an entirely different chicken item.  The server realized the mistake once she placed the meal in front of me.  Then my wife found a hair in her meal that she ordered.  I normally would chalk all this up to simply a bad experience that needed to be weighted against all the previously good experiences we had had at Tags.  \\n\\nMy wife and I again returned to Tags about a month ago, hoping that things may have improved.  I think it is the one establishment that we would give second, third and fourth chances to.  We sat on the patio and ordered a half order appetizer of their calamari.  It was obvious to us that the portion size was considerably smaller then on previous visits, as we normally would order the calamari appetizer.  When our orders arrived again, I did not receive what I had ordered.  When the waiter placed my meal in front of me, I asked him what I had ordered.   He said, \\\" Penne noodle, rustic roma sauce, and it looks like...hhhhmmm...meat?\\\"  The poor guy couldnt even read his own writing, so I guess I cant fault the kitchen staff for making the wrong meal.  I had ordered a pasta bowl of penne nooodles, rustic roma sauce and mozzerella cheese.  He asked if I would have liked to send it back, but my wife already had her meal and had I sent it back she would have been done by the time my meal was served.  There was no offer of taking the meal off the check or getting the manager to visit our table to see how things were.  Again, I think this goes back to some management issues with this particular restaurant.  Due to Tags expansion, many of the more proactive managers, Rhonda being my favorite, were sent to the newer restaurants to manage them.  Unfortunately that has left  the 59th Ave Tags with a manager that is not proactive in his customer service nor congenial in nature.  It seems that this is reflected in much of the staffs attitudes also.  \\n\\nIt is my hope that Tags will return to its previous place as one of our favorites, but I wont be one that will hold my breath until that happens.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: So go here once just to say you have gone, but it's not that exciting.

I took it through the wash and when they were done wiping it down, the glass repair guy who was affiliated with this car wash told me I had a crack in my windshield. I drove this van every day and knew there was no crack, but I thought there might be a possibility that it may have happened that day and I just did not notice this dime sized crack right in front of my face.\\n\\nSo the kid from Romania told me he could give me a great deal at $80. I told him no that i was selling it and I was not going to spend a penny more on it. He did not want to lose money so he brought it down to $60, then $40, then $35. I repeated that i would not spend money on it. He gave me an offer of $25 so I accepted and told him that i would use him in the future if I have any windshield repair work.\\n\\nWhile he was repairing my windshield he realized I was a locksmith and asked me if  I would make him a key to his mid-90's Honda Civic. I remembered it very well with super dark tint, primered and appeared it would was being prepped for painting. \\n\\nWhen he finished he asked me for my name/number/ADDRESS for the invoice. I found that odd since I was paying cash. He assured me it was standard policy and I would not receive spam calls or mail.\\n\\nA week later after I purchased my new Chevy Express van, I was in the front of my house and noticed this same kid driving his Honda Civic by my house that appeared to be looking for an address. He came to a stop 1 house past mine and looked at me and then took off abruptly.\\n\\nThe next day I was on my way to a job and noticed a crack in the windshield on a van with less that 200 miles on it. Immediately I suspected this kid from Romania who also works with a bunch of family members that own the company. He must have done it at night under the cover of darkness.\\n\\nI called the 16 st location and revealed my suspicions who in turn told me to call the owner at another location. When I spoke with the owner he thought it was the most absurd thing he had ever heard. He conveniently disconnected from the call and when I called back it went to voicemail.\\n\\nI had a large credit on my prepaid card so I was going to use it and had gone back for another wash and spoke with the manager. I told her my story and she assured me she knew this family and that she trusted them and that they would never do such a thing. I had no proof so I could only argue my case to a certain extent without sounding crazy.\\n\\nThe next time I had gone back the Romanian kid was there and I was cleaning the mess out of the cab so it could be vacuumed. I was throwing everything valuable in a  plastic bag to sort out later and had a trash can to throw the junk away, so I know this kid never examined my windshield.. I WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM DOING SO..\\n\\nThe kid walks up from behind the back of the van and told me that I had a crack in my windshield. I just glared at him for about 5 seconds without saying anything and told him not to worry about it. There are two things that made this kid guilty. 1) like I mentioned before I would have seen him examining the windshield if he did. So the ONLY  way for him to know if there was a crack is if he did it himself. 2) If he had examined my windshield he would have noticed that it had ALREADY BEEN REPAIRED. That's how I know for sure he did it, but still I had no proof.\\n\\nI had let my van go a couple months without washing it and the next time I came in I asked a random worker what happened to the Romanian (windshield  repair) family. The worker told me they were being watched due to other customers who were suspicious and that he was caught with a spring loaded punch cracking a windshield. So the owner let them go....\\n\\nAfter all that you would think they would apologize and give me some credits to make up for it, but they did not.\\n\\nThe last straw for me was when the Ultimate car wash did not appear to give a wax coat along with the appearance of the machine and worker not doing a thorough job of cleaning. When I asked if I could take it through again the kid gave me a hard time.  After taking it through a second time I noticed bird dropping that were still there so I just took it upon myself to finish the job myself.\\n\\nI'm glad I only have a few dollars left on my prepaid card. Since I have no reason to go back, I will be finding a new car wash from now on.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Yet again I am disappointed with Arizona's selection of ethnic food.

This place is well worth finding.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Tourist trap #2.\\n\\nOnce again the decor is much more pleasant to stare in awe at than the actual food! It looks like you're in a glamorous room this time instead of a kid's play room like in Serendipity. My girls and I came here for our last meal in Vegas. Wasn't too hungry so we got the 2 appetizers and a main dish: Ahi Tuna Sliders, Mac & Cheese Balls, and the BLT Sandwich. \\n\\nThe sliders were alright. The ahi tuna was not the greatest because it wasn't entirely fresh. The sliders were also super DINKY! 3 sliders for $20? rip off..... It sort of lacked a certain taste I was looking for. Almost too savory! \\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese Balls were okay. Clever! Fried balls with mac & cheese in the middle? Once again it was like 3 balls for like $15. \\n\\nThe sandwich was pretty good! Took a bite out of it and it was HUGE! Almost too hard to bite into. The fries were addicting! But then again you can't really mess up on fries. \\n\\nTheir fancy goblet drinks are what makes this place known. If I had a bigger appetite that day, I probably would've opted for an actual meal with a drink! Like Serendipity 3, I think I even saw some frozen drinks! \\n\\nThis place is cool because it is open 24/7! A nice classy place like this always open? Plus! Also it's sister stores Sugar Factory is next door selling baked sweets and other delightful goodies!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: WOW. first AND last time i'll ever stay at Aria.\\n\\nOk, so I don't know whose genius idea it was to update and take offline the reservations system the day before EDC AND during a Manny Pacquiao weekend, but all systems were down when I attempted to check-in Thursday.\\n\\nOne thing I've noticed lately about my visits to fancy schmancy places is that management or the highers that be are seldom as great as the employees that support them. The bellhop that greeted us and helped us with our bags and the front desk agents that I encountered were WONDERFUL and the saving graces of a hotel that is quickly spiraling down like pennies into a barrel for the make-a-wish foundation.\\n\\nhow can i sum up aria in one word? butterface.\\n\\nI liken Aria to the butterface of the strip. For a definition, see http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=butterface \\n\\nYou see, Aria is HOT. It's shiny, it's pretty, it's relatively new. for the city center uninitiated, and from the glossiness of its glossy photos from its glossy website, i thought that aria would be a classy joint in a classy plaza, but alas, everything is good but. her. face. \\n\\nif you will, let's imagine that the exterior (architecture, art, tables, fancy rooms with remote-controlled everythang) is the body. Judging Aria by its cover, DAMN the girl is banging! But when you factor in a 3 hour wait to check in (i knew all those suits huddled in the middle while sorting through stacks of paper wasn't a good thing), and the lack of communication between staff members...she ugly, yo.\\n\\nFor being inconvenienced, aria was giving away room comps. they told us to call the next morning for our comps, and so i did. guy said i would get X amount, and that was that. when i went to use it the next day, however, the person on the other end of the line said that it wasn't good anymore since i had already checked out.\\n\\nwell, damn,  if i KNEW i couldn't use the comp after i checked out, I WOULD'VE USED IT BEFORE I CHECKED OUT. i told her that i was never informed that i had to use it prior to checking out, and like an elementary school shouting match, she kept snapping \\\"well, you had to use your comps before you checked out.\\\" hey, beezy, i ain't deaf. i heard you the FIRST TIME, and so i repeated with, \\\"yes, you just SAID that, and I just said that i wouldn't have checked out if i'd known. the gentleman on the phone FAILED. TO. MENTION. THAT. TO. ME.\\\" her, \\\"well, there's nothing that i can do.\\\" me, \\\"this IS a casino. can't you write up a comp?\\\" her, \\\"we. don't. do. that. here.\\\" \\n\\noh, damn, fancy pants Aria is too fancy to write up comps?? \\n\\nluckily, the cashier took pity on me and suggested that i go see a manager, so i went downstairs and straight to the front desk.  explained to james, the young asian gentleman (in case Aria management would like to promote an excellent employee) at the desk my predicament, and he went off to talk to his manager to see what he could do.\\n\\nhe comes back about ten minutes later with a comp double the size of my original one. when i saw the paper in his hands, my eyes widened and i squeaked, \\\"SHE LIED TO ME?!\\\" james, \\\"excuse me?\\\" to which i had to explain to him what had happened only moments before (the extremely unpleasant exchange). James then apologizes for the mishap.  it wasn't even his fault and he apologized. i have yet to hear an apology from the snarky trick on the phone. \\n\\nbottom line: there will always be a bigger, better, and brighter mega-casino popping up on the strip, but what keeps them in business is their staff. with inconsistent service, from the kind and friendly to the vitriolic, Aria won't be around for long unless it starts to quality check its services & employees from the top--down.\\n\\ni, for one, am done with Aria, and the experience has actually turned me off from the strip. Thankfully, i spent 3 days at the lovely Golden Nugget downtown, and will be frequenting that casino and its downtown sistas & bruthas whenever I come to vegas from now on. does that mean i'm getting old, or does that mean i've finally wised up to the sheer pretentiousness that often occurs on-strip? who knows...one thing i can assure you of is that i will stay away from aria's nasty ass face. no matter how cool that one button control is.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Red Lobsters Biscuits is what drives me to dine at their restaurant. However, now that they sell their brand of biscuits at Costco, I fail to see why I would ever dine here again. \\n\\nI love seafood. It's my favorite food. However, Red Lobster seems to think that the best way to cook a good seafood dish is to drown it in garlic and butter. My goodness, it's ridiculous how much butter and oil is used in any given dish. I am (was) a huge fan of their Salmon New Orleans. It came with wild rice, broccoli, broiled salmon and shrimp covered in a tabasco butter sauce. I always got the sauce on the side because again, the add too much butter/oil. Since the dish is super easy to make, I decided to make it on my own with less butter. Viola! Dish turned out better than Red Lobster (IMO which is very bias I will admit) For what you pay to get a good meal, the food is very average while being coated in nothing but butter. Even the salads are iffy. \\n\\nTheir food is nothing special. The most decent cooker can make anything on their menu. I never understood why the lines are always out of the damn door when I drive by on a weekend. Convenience? Must be. However, people must REALLY like it considering the wait time on a Friday or Saturday night can be up to a hour. \\n\\nIf I am to leave one positive comment, the service has always been great in my past experience dining here.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "index": "12", "compressed_output": {"compressed_prompt": "Sentence Middle Eastern food favorite food group bottom of pyramid inkling love restaurant before stepped foot. expletives shouted throughout meal owners Kabob grape leaves best in Charlotte. new dish with Muhammara bathe daily hummus - combination of roasted red peppers walnuts spices molasses smoky sweet.

The patties were fine and cooked correctly but unremarkable, and the toppings were varied and included some interesting choices.  The potatoes (sweet potato tots and regular fries) were more of the same.  Not bad, but nothing terribly interesting.\\n\\nBut the service.  My God, the service.  I don't know that I can remember all of the things that went wrong, but I can assure you this stands out in my mind as one of the top three worst service experiences I can ever remember having.  We were seated for about 10 minutes before anyone came by to say hi.  We had some salads and burgers and we were here for over an hour.  This is not a fine dining establishment, and we were not loitering.  My burger came out with no fries.  Nothing, just a burger on a plate, and no one thought \\\"Hey, that looks funny.\\\"\\n\\nAnd it wasn't just us!  The couple seated next to us sat down about 15 minutes after we did.  They probably sat for 15 minutes before anyone came to take their orders.  They got a couple beers about 15 minutes later, and by the time we left, they STILL had no food in front of them!  We told our waiter when we left that these poor people had been completely ignored all night, and we hoped that would maybe get some attention to them.  For all I know, they're still sitting there silently, waiting for someone to give them some food.\\n\\nThe food was fine, but not in a million years would I come back here to be disrespected and ignored just to have a burger and fries.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I took my Mom here for her birthday in December...

Very overpriced, we ordered one combo platter one cheese spaetzl dish, 2 deserts to go ($10 each) and 1 cocktail and soda. Total was almost $90. Another negative, This place is listed as good for kids and I must say that even with my 7 & 9 yr old who love to be around music and noise, but this place is unbearably loud. Can't even talk to one another or hear the waitresses, and I'm not exaggerating either. My kids looked like they were drowning in the noise, both were slumped in their seats almost falling asleep because of the disturbing noise of drunkenness surrounding this large room of hoorah and screaming. You literally feel trapped. Women were being spanked with paddles by the employees, while men cheered on.

However, I was disappointed.  The cantonese style  sweet and sour I had was certainly nothing to get too excited about and the friend rice I had alongside was also fairly unspectacular, although still fairly nice to eat.  The prawn crackers were also very similar to those that I could buy from the supermarket for about half the price.  \\n\\nThe saving grace was the curry sauce and noodles that my girlfriend ordered.  The curry sauce was deliciously smooth and not grainy as is often the case. The noodles proved to be jammed tight into the foil container, and as a result the portion was very generous. The prices seemed fairly standard: they did not strike me as particularly cheap but they also did not make my jaw drop to the floor as other Chinese takeaways have done.  \\n\\nOverall, if you're nearby and are desperately craving a bit of Chinese takeaway, this is fine. However, if possible, shop around first to avoid too much disappointment.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Over priced,low grade food. Owner moody and miserable. Better value at Taco Bell.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Big fan.  Not traditional mexican, but more like Nuevo mexican.  The flautas are the best.

I wear a 10.5W and usually end up in an 11.  No 11s.  No wides.  I actually have better luck finding stylish wider shoes at Macy's and Dillars.  (dillards has a store brand that runs wide and comes in 11s)\\n\\nI won't ever buy from Zappos again because of their discriminatory hiring practices so I'm saving tons of money by NOT being able to find my size and style.  (OK... so I thinned down my shoe collection from 120 to about 40 so I really don't *need* any more shoes!)\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place had some seriously amazing Louisiana style sea food dishes.  Too bad i showed up off-season for craw fish, but other than that, it was total class.  \\nThey seated me and my friend in the corner but we end up having a great view of the place, and seemed a bit more intimate that way. This also gave us a great view of the outside seating area to people watch as well.\\nThe food itself was very rich and delicious.  I don't remember the name of the dish but it featured baked oysters.  Every bite was delicious.\\nI am definitely coming back there if I am looking for a nice seat down in the West Valley.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The only reason I ever come to this mall is because it happenes to be close to work for me.  I really dont like going there though, there is always some family causing a scene in the middle of the walkway, and most of the stores dont interest me.  It also smells funny even though it seems to be pretty clean.\\n\\nI will say that this season I found some cute bathing suits on sale at Macy's but you can go to any mall in the valley and find the same thing.\\n\\nBonus that fiesta doesnt ever seem to be THAT busy when I'm there during the week in the middle of the day.  \\n\\nOther than a very few positive points, I'd go elsewhere for a memorable and successful shopping experience.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: My Mexican food standards are pretty high and everyone SWORE by this place so I finally tried it a few months ago.  If I'm going to suffer the plight of diarrhea, I'd at least like some flavor to make it worth it.  I would truly prefer eating frozen burritos over this place.  \\n\\nI'd also like to know who provided this restaurant with a single dollar sign.  I paid $12 for a soft tortilla on the bottom of my taco salad, bland meat and sparse, tasteless cheese sprinkled on top with a side of the nastiest salad dressing I've ever had.  Oh, and a small drink cup.\\n \\nI had to shout my order across the noise to the person making my order and could barely hear the questions being asked.  I might have verbally agreed to the assassination of someone being held hostage in the kitchen, I'll never know.   Normally, that sort of thing doesn't bother me with this style of  restaurant (the shouting, not assassination), but this was worse than a bar on a Saturday night hosting 5 21st birthday parties.\\n\\nAnd the atmosphere?  Kids everywhere, kids screaming and kids dropping their food and crying. I'm not a kid person, but the parent to child ration was 1:3 and that could shake anyone trying to eat lunch.  The tables were so close together you had to ask the guests behind you to scoot forward so you could get out and the tables were built around the waiting line so the people in line had the pleasure of watching you eat and you had the pleasure of being uncomfortable.\\nI could go on and on, but you get the gist of it.  \\n\\nEvery offer for free lunch to this place has been declined every since that first visit, I will never eat there again.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Ate with a large party, so only saw limited menu. Steaks were excellentt, had Filet, very tender. Vegetables were slathered in butter, kind of nasty. Caesar's Salad very good, nice tasty anchovies on the side. Cheesecake was good, but not great, crust not thick enough.  Service was very slow, sat with empty wine glass most of the dinner.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This hotel now feels really outdated.  It's just a little, I don't know... old and out of shape.  It was cool before, but on my last stay I started noticing small things like slightly peeled wallpaper and less than great decor.\\n\\nWith all the new hotels around The Strip, this place needs a major upgrade plan if it wants to stay competitive.  Otherwise it's heading down the road to being just another cheap outdated LV hotel/casino.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Love the Lobster enchiladas; not on the menu, special item usually Saturdays. The flan is excellent. Family run business, very friendly people. Recipes have been handed down for generations.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: How does one rate a place that serves tasty food that sadly makes them deathly ill the next morning? \\n\\nWell, let's begin with the facts. I came to this establishment with three guests. \\n\\nThe decor was nice. The atmosphere was quiet. I believe we were one of two tables being served on this particular night. \\n\\nMy party and I all tried a shrimp dish, which was one of their specials. The flavor was good.\\n\\nService was slow, especially since it was a fairly slow night. \\n\\nThe next morning, all of my friends were sick, as was I. Coincidence? Perhaps. \\nOr it could have been the shrimp.\\n\\nIt will take me a while to gain the courage to give George's a second try. Right now, I can't even think about it without feeling nauseous. \\n\\nLuckily, it seems like this was perhaps a fluke, for some of my other friends have had good experiences here. No restaurant is perfect.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Worst dinning experience I have had of that caliber. We went there three of us here late on a Friday night for our pre-party grub. \\n\\nOur waiter, which I'm glad I had forgotten his name already, had the worst attitude. We asked him to suggest items on the menu and he was pressuring to order items he suggested standing over the table, and wouldn't leave until we asked for a couple of minutes. \\n\\nThe kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life. \\n\\nThe food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas. \\n\\nMost overrated, perhaps the only redeeming factor to this place, which got us in there in the first place is its decorative interior, but don't be fooled, it's got nothing to live up to it.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: We had a delicious meal. The ambiance was very nice. The tables were a little close together. Our bus boy Sean was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  Jason was our server who was also very attentive   The general Johnny stopped by our table and when we praised Sean and told him how much we enjoyed the food he promised to bring his business card. So we could call him for future reservations. He disappeared and that was the last we saw of him.  Sean services was the most positive aspect of the meal.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I'm a big fan of good ribs and this place fell short of good ribs. The price wasn't bad because of the $10 for $20 coupon I bought on Yelp but they quality just wasn't there. The ribs weren't tender and a little cold I used extra bbq sauce cause the taste of the ribs wasn't very good. I do want to say the service was good though.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This restaurant originated in Heber.  I spent lots of time up here as a teenager, and Heber brings back lots of good memories, so I liked this place before I ever set foot in the door, and when I did, oh my.  \\n\\nThis place is fan freakin tastic.  Food was great, service was great,  there was even a mariachi band on Saturday night.  \\n\\nThe amount of food you get, we both had another meal the next day.  We both got the taco, cheese enchilada and red burrito plate that comes with rice and beans.   Red chili meat was plentiful, very tender and tasty.  Taco had lots of tender juicy shredded beef.  But the best part of this plate was the cheese enchilada.  OMG it was good.  The enchilada sauce was definitely homemade.  I plan to go back to this place soon.   Rice and beans were good too.  Hot sauce was very spicy, and they had another option that wasn't as spicy too.  And we both got a soda.  Bill was under $27.  \\n\\nI'm serious, try it.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I am for Chuck box  being a great place. First of all . In my opinion I Believe that chuck box is a great place for lunch and dinner , because a lot of families are happy when they are at chuck box second , the chuck box is off campus it's near to ASU. Third , the quality of service is good and staff at chuck box is so friendly . Finally , for there reasons I think chuck box is good place to eat . :)\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I really don't like this gym. I haven't had much luck with ever coming in when a friendly staff member is working. Most of the people seem either uninterested in their job or uninformed about what their job is. It smells sweaty when you walk in. The locker rooms are not good- no tv's, no swim suit dryer, and no privacy if you need to shower. Please renovate and hire a more enthusiastic staff!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Great rolled tacos and machaca burrito. But, the smell of pine sol was too strong. Wished there would haven been outdoor seating.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Debating to write a review about this one, but people has the right to know what other people think of the place.  Giving this a 2 star might be to generous. \\n\\nLocated off Decatur and Ann in the corner of the Smith Parking lot, is a bar and grill called Bilbo's.  The place looks nice on the outside, it is decent on the inside.  But kind of felt a bit awkward coming in, since there was no one to really greet us and wasn't really much of a sign to either wait, or take our own seats.  So we just sat to the closest table that was near the door.  The table itself was kind of sticky, I was contemplating to move to the table next to us but didn't want to be rude.  \\n\\nThe waitress finally came over after a long while, to give us a menu, which there was very little to choose from.  The wife and I, mainly had the same thing and thought the food was at least edible.  Wasn't great, but edible enough to eat.  Refills on drinks were slow as well.  What kind of got me is that, the place wasn't as busy and it took a long time to be checked upon.  Mainly, if it takes more than 15 minutes to check up on some people, that's way to long I believe.  I can probably understand if they're busy, but 2-3 people in the bar, 2 other couples at the booth.  Shouldn't take a waitress long to check on people.  I'm sure it may be lack of staffing and other situations, but lack of customer service doesn't help the business.  \\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't come here again, but if you end up going, it's probably good for beers at the bar, where there should be some one there majority of the time.  I wouldn't suggest to eat there cause it looks like they don't clean their tables very well.  But if you really have no other choice, don't expect much from it.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Extremely caring practice. The doctors and staff are very good with our kids.

Instead, we opted to just go to the window thinking it would be quicker than to wait for a table, but I was wrong.  There must have been less than 8 people in front of the to-go order window, and it took 20+ minutes to ORDER.  I have no idea what took so long to take people's order, but then you wait AGAIN to actually pick up your order.\\n\\nNow, the frozen hot chocolate... it was good.  $10 good for a regular size? NO WAY.  Definitely overpriced\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Airport location, Monday, 6am.  10 minute wait just to be seated, when the restaurant is 1/4 full. 10 minute wait to be served, at the bar.  20 minute wait until the food came, right as I decided it had taken too long and I had to board my flight.

Sure the menu might be $$$ but we were not disappointed with flavors :)\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I visited Wicked Spoon 2x this year. Once in August for Sunday Brunch and once for the Monday brunch after Christmas. From what I remember, the Sunday brunch in August was SO much better than the Monday Brunch.  I understand that weekend brunches is when they have better food (and thus higher prices) but we were charged for a \\\"holiday\\\" price and it was not to the standards of a normal Sunday brunch but cost like $10 more! HMPH. \\n\\nThe good: I think it's really cute that they put some of their entrees in mini pots and pans pre-portioned. And their mini macaroons are super cute! There were lots of gelato flavors and the guy scooping it was funny/quirky. Their smoked salmon was really good too. \\n\\nThings to improve on: they need to expand their salad bar and cut more fruit.\\nMake smaller portions of the pancakes? I felt bad cutting the pancake and taking only a quarter because I knew no one was going to get my sad leftovers. \\nCoffee was horrible.  I couldnt drink more than a few gulps. \\nWaiter services was pretty slow. We were left with empty drinks for quite a while until we saw our waiter again. \\n\\nLine wasn't too bad ~1 hr.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: No windows, so it's kind of dreary inside. Fancy lighting on the walls that changes color. I had a breakfast skillet that was mostly potatoes, the sausage was cheap skinny link sausage that had been sliced into discs, and flavor was lacking somewhere. I needed to add salt and ketchup, and I don't even like ketchup on my breakfast foods. Too many potatoes. And the price for a dish was about a dollar or two more than it should be.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This is a real fast food place, BUT Kosher. The 4 stars is not for the food which is fine but really because mega is actually serving kosher fast food and keeps the place clean and offers lots of choice (for a burger joint).

I hope this place lasts...\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Despite being a Marriott-brand hotel, Courtyard Pittsburgh Downtown's service and room qualities were not up to par with the Marriott standard but still charged Marriott price.\\n\\nI had a bad impression of this hotel before I even entered. I made a two-night reservation for a business trip, but I was stranded in an airport overnight because of cancelled flights. I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying. Eventually, I had to get my project manager to resolve this issue. \\n\\nBoth the room and the lobby were not spacious, although that's understandable given that the hotel was in downtown. What's not understandable was the creaking floor throughout the hotel floor, which amplified no matter how light my steps were. Good thing that I was not living below night owls, but that would not matter because the AC unit was too loud to get a good sleep anyway. Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me.\\n\\nSeriously reconsider if you decide to live here. Aside from sub-par room and service that are unusually low by the Marriott standard, note that the only available parking nearby will escalate the unjust price that you have to pay to stay in this hotel.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Ive brought a bunch of pants and jeans I bought from Nordstrom here to be hemmed and couldn't tell that they weren't factory hems.

The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.\\n\\nShortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.\\n\\nPlease understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.  It tasted like drinking cantaloupe juice.\\n\\nIf you are a frybread company then you should at least do the frybread really well and then build on top of that.  This place just didn't have it together I'm afraid.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Experience:  I came with a group of folks to try this place out. There were about 10 of us.  \\n\\nService:  the waitress was pretty friendly, but the star was the one of the owners.

She made me want to pull up a chair and drink a beer with her. \\n\\nFood: I'm not sure why so many people said negative things about their food. Maybe I caught them on a good day, maybe they caught them on a bad day, but I really enjoyed the food. \\nI ordered the two meat plate with pulled pork and sausage links. My two sides were mac and cheese and potato salad. I liked everything on my plate.  I even tried some ribs off my friends plate and enjoyed those too!!!  \\n\\nFacility: this place is on the smaller side, but we were able to fit our group in good. \\n\\nOverall review:  Since I haven't tried too many BBQ places, I have to claim this as my favorite BBQ in Vegas.  Even if I find another place, this will still be one of my fav spots!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Just moved into the neighborhood, and walked over with our 6 year old for some pizza.  I hate to be negative, but it wasn't a great experience.  We had a 10 minute wait for the \\\"family section\\\" (which was okay, no worries there) but once we were seated it was a good 10 minutes more for a server to acknowledge us.  Once she did, she asked if we were ready to order, and seemed disappointed when we only ordered drinks.  Drinks delivered, and we ordered pizza.  She never once checked on us to see how we were doing - it was 1) take drink order (and be disappointed because we didn't have food order ready) 2) take food order, deliver food and 3) bring check (at which point I asked for another beer - and missed happy hour because of the delay.  Sorry, but horrible service.  It's almost like they don't want us there.

When the doctor came in he looked at my foot for a minute and said that it was probably a blood clot and I needed an ultrasound. A few minutes later a nurse comes in telling me to sign a form so I can be transfered to the ER at UMC, WTF? So I asked if that was really neccessary and she said yes so off I went. Got to the ER at about 8:30 pm and didn't leave until 3:40 am! The waiting room wasn't even that full but I was out there for 2 hours before they called me back and then was sent back out again, this happened a few times. I was finally called back and taken for my ultrasound around 12:15 but I didn't even realize that was where I was going till they parked me in the hall outside the ultrasound room, then I had to wait because no one had the paperwork for me. When the ultrasound was done they came and wheeled me to a room and then just left me with no explanation about what was coming next, oh and the guy pushing me said he would go get my husband but he never did, I had to get up and ask a nurse if he could come back since he didn't know what was goin on with me at that point. So got to the room and waited and waited and finally after about an hour a doctor comes in (doesn't tell me his name or anything) and starts asking me what is wrong, hello isn't that on my chart at this point, but ok I go through the story again and he says that it probably isn't a blood clot but he will have to look at the ultrasound and then *poof* he is gone and never to be seen again. After another 1.5 hours I'm really tired and getting really pissed off so I look for a nurse to ask what is going on and when I find one she asks me if the doctor is discharging me!?! How the hell would I know, so I tell her I haven't seen the doctor for 1.5 hours and last I heard he was supposed to be reviewing my ultrasound. She says she will go check with him, yeah you do that, so I go and sit and wait and then another nurse comes in and tells me to sign the discharge paperwork. Ummm so what the hell is going on with my foot, \\\"Oh there's no blood clot but you knew that\\\", so I ask how the hell am I supposed to know that if no one tells me. So fine what is wrong with my foot and what do I do to get it small enough to fit into a shoe again? She literally shoves a prescription for 800mg ibuprofean in my face and says take that and keep it elevated. At this point I am either going to start crying or hitting people so I just take the paper work and leave since it is now 20 to 4am and I have to be at work by 9. \\n\\nThis is the absolute worst health care experience I have ever had and I just pray that neither I nor any of my loved ones have a true emergency and get sent to this hospital.

I do not come to this nightlife amalgamation for 8-1/2.

I like even less the crowd that such an atmosphere attracts.  And this is the crap that 8-1/2 plays all the time.  \\n\\nThe decor isn't bad.  I like the draperies over the couches.  They have a pool table and a Pacman machine.\\n\\nI'd describe the people who hang out on the 8-1/2 side as \\\"gay douchebag lite.\\\"\\n\\nI hate the damned bartenders, though.  They are notorious for their inability to set consistent drink prices.  I've bought well vodka sodas for $5, $8, and $7 over the course of a single night, ALL FROM THE SAME BARTENDER.  They also charged me $3 for a soft drink.  Criminal.\\n\\nPiranha, on the other hand, plays dance/trance/house, has great gogo dancers, and a happenin' dance floor.  Be cool, like me.

The one main downfall was that at 1AM seemingly every door was locked and it took a trip around the building to finally find someone who happened to be walking out and we had to yell at her to hold the door open for us.

After seeing a physician, whose treatment was not effective, I saw Dr. Vaughn after reading his reviews on Yelp.\\n To make a long story short, I got in promptly and he gave me advice on how I might possibly avoid an injection into my foot, which advice I very much appreciated.  That advice helped, but did not resolve the problem so I returned for the usually unpleasant steroid injection.  Let me tell you, I never felt the injection or the manipulation of the needle.  A great experience and I believe that my problem is over.I would very highly commend Dr. Vaughn  to my friends.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I visited The Living Room tonight for the first time after hearing a lot about it from several of my friends. Upon approach I noticed the exterior is well kept and seems classy; when you walk in, it's spacious with a a very nice, warm decor (evidently it was recently remodeled and it looks great). The atmosphere is very inviting.\\nI sat down with my friends at the community high top table in the center and we were greeted almost immediately, from that point on the service went down. We informed the young lady that greeted us that we weren't sure which wine we'd like yet so we would take water for the time being. The water never came but by the time she returned we were ready to order wine and appetizers. \\nThe bruschetta, sliders, and the pretzel we ordered came out very quickly (we actually ordered them all at separate times throughout the evening and each time the quick delivery time was equally impressive).\\nThe biggest problem was finding a server to even notice that we needed to order food and/or drinks. Each time our glasses sat empty, pushed off to the side for a minimum of 5 minutes before anyone would even acknowledge us and inquire as to whether or not we would like more, despite the fact that we were constantly being passed by servers. The servers seem to share the entire restaurant and I think that creates confusion as to who has or has not been helped; they just assume that someone else is taking care of you.\\n\\nTo recap, I'll just say that the food was delicious, much better deserving of a four star rating, and their wine selection was equally good. The service, however, is a major detractor and in my opinion is the most important part of any good dining experience. As Benjamin Franklin said, \\\"The handshake of the host, determines the flavor of the roast,\\\" and I've had much better service at Postino's or D-Vine.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Super busy and unhappy waiters \\n\\nFood comes nothing like their pictures on the Manu.

One had a hamburger, which he said was very good, and had similar praise for the sweet potato fries as well.\\n\\nOther friends we saw at another table, said the liver and onions were delicious...and they are hard people to please.\\n\\nService was excellent. More iced tea delivered even before a glass was empty. Owners help deliver the food, and all servers seemed to be doing a very effective job. \\n\\nThe other thing I liked is that the server told us what the special of the evening was, instead of assuming that we saw it on the board, on our way in. Many restaurant servers \\\"assume\\\" that you know what the specials are, and don't bother telling you.\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars was because we all asked that the garlic butter sauce be left off of the salmon. Two of the 3 dishes came with the sauce on the salmon. The server was very apologetic and offered to take them back, but the 2 people kept it. \\n\\nWe'll definitely be back.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I emailed this letter to the store;\\n\\nHello:\\n\\nYesterday afternoon I found myself in the unfortunate position of being 350 miles from my studio without a piece of equipment.  While I was driving into Phoenix from Los Angeles,I realized we had left a posing stool. We called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one. We were told yes. We then set a course to come to your store immediately.  Unfortunately, coming from CA we didn't realize you we're 1 hour aead of us.  We called once the realization hit. We had 75 minutes to travel 60 miles.  We made every effort to arrive by 6:00, as we were told rather rudely, that the store was closing at 6 sharp.  At 5:55, from about 4 blocks away, we called again and asked if they could ready our purchase, that we would run in and buy. We were told NO, that we better arrive before 6, that \\\"You have 4 minutes\\\".  I cannot begin to express the frustration and anger that your store couldn't accommodate a simple request, and was completely unsympathetic to the fact that we were driving straight from LA to you.  In fact, I arrived at 6:00 on the dot, as Randy I believe was locking the door.  He could have cared less. While part of me says, \\\"the people who run this store don't care about anything, why write this email\\\", as a business owner and potential customer, you deserve to know why I will make it my personal mission on every review site, website etc to let other potential customers know, just how much you value our business.\\n\\nI have never been treated like that by any company or vendor, and as a fellow business owner, I'm appalled by the blatant attitude and disrespect. I don't know any other company who wouldn't have gladly tried to help us or offered a solution acceptable to both.\\n\\nI wish your business luck for the future.

We are really excited to have them in the neighborhood and hope they get everything worked out soon.\\n\\nSo first, our orders were messed up, we got the wrong mussels (Horseradish instead of bacon blue cheese) and as it turns out, the Horseradish mussels were not good. I'm known to protect mussel broth from being cleared until every last bit is sopped up into crusty french bread, and this recipe allowed the bread to stay put in the basket.  When we asked about it because we tasted no bacon, the waiter said, \\\"oh yes, that's right you did order the bacon ones.  Do you want that taken off your bill?\\\"  Awkward....\\n\\nSecond,   we ordered pasta dishes and the waiter made a point of recommending linguine, which was fine because pasta shapes weren't listed on the menu and we never would have thought of requesting a particular one.  What made this strange was that when we asked him about it when both our dishes came out wrong, he told us the kitchen was serving whatever pasta they could put out quickest and was that okay with us.  Oh, you linguine tease, you!\\n\\nSo, to wrap up, nothing that can't be fixed and the place will be a great addition to the neighborhood.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Unless you are prepared to spend $30-$40 a person on food in vegas, like at Outback steakhouse, horrible casino cafes, buffets, or even more on fancy restaurants, like Craft, or Spago, then Greenberg Deli really isnt too bad.

Little to her knowledge, my girlfriend works for a federal agency and makes reservations for the big wigs who come into town. Guess where they will never be referred to?!? She offered no discount or anything to accommodate for the major inconvenience. The plan was to stay down on Fremont for the day but by the lack of customer service she had the day was cut short.

I can honestly only give them 2 stars. It's horrible that I can't run over there for a salad when my kids insist on McDonald's because I know I'll wait forever and that my nearly $10 (with tax) salad won't have bacon or will be so small in its plastic to-go container so as to make me say \\\"never again\\\" and \\\"I'd rather pay $5 for the Grilled Banch Ranch Salad at McD's. Ugh, I hate that I just wrote that! But at least they have my food ready right away and NEVER forget the bacon.\\n\\nMy first experience was way back when they opened and I loved their pancakes with bananas and creme fraiche and peanuts, but the side of bacon wasn't quite cooked right (I should be able to request \\\"fatty bacon\\\" and not get snappy-crisp bacon, right?) but since then, every time I've had them since, it tastes like the batter wasn't mixed thoroughly and I taste the egg... if I wanted eggs, I'd order them. And I have. The farmer's veggie omelet has always been to my liking and the coffee is fine.\\n\\nThe croque moiseur is quite good as well.\\n\\nBut overall, I'll agree with many of the reviewers in that the quality does not quite justify the expense, especially when you consider the wait time (25 minutes for a to-go salad and there was no one ahead of me on line!) and the generally indifferent staff.\\n\\nI don't plan on trying them for dinner because I'm assuming I will come away with the same \\\"meh\\\" feeling.

I have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied. You could not pay me $20 to eat the food I ordered again.\\n\\nWe were starving. Neither of us had eaten all day. The first thing we did was order the Nachos. It came with \\\"Nacho\\\" liquid cheese you find at gas stations and sporting events. I am talking the pasty orange processed shit, pun fucking intended. They dumped this shit all over a giant plate of chips and sprinkled on some seasoned ground beef and charged us $9. \\n\\nN-I-N-E FUCKING DOLLARS. If I'm paying $9 for tortilla chips and cheese, I expect actual cheese, not processed liquid cheese that I can buy at Costco in eighty pound bags for $15. That's 10 cents an ounce. There was *maybe* 3 ounces of cheese on my chips. That's 30 cents of cheese which is arguably the most expensive ingredient of the dish. The entire plate of nachos probably cost them $1. \\n\\nWe did not finish them. We each ate around six or seven Nacho cheese coated chips before we were saved by our entrees. Lucky us, or so we thought. Apparently \\\"smothered\\\" burritos actually means fucking coated with Nacho cheese. Fuck. You can tell I really hate this shit. Let's move on.\\n\\nMy $14 entree consisted of 2 tacos, 1 mini burrito, and a chimichanga. The beef in my tacos was ground fine. Real fine. So fine that you could no longer tell what part of the cow a particular granule came from. All I can say was that it was better than the refried beans of the \\\"just add water\\\" variety. Not joking. The beans were the texture of a watery soup. I think the cook added too much water to mine because when I got the plate the beans were on the left side. By the end of the meal they had oozed across the entire plate like a thick viscous creature. Like all \\\"just add water\\\" refried beans of jail cafeteria quality, it tasted like cardboard.\\n\\nThe chicken taco was edible. I think. I ate it at least. I was starving though. Again, we hadn't eaten all day. I didn't touch the Nacho cheese coated burritos. I tried the chimichanga last. I had two bites.\\n\\nThe rice was the best thing on the plate.\\n\\nThe service was as good as it possibly could have been. You could tell the servers did not like working there.

Save yourself the frustration and stomachache.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I was so excited to take my boyfriend to Cartwrights after I had a wonderful dinner with my mother several months ago. After sitting down I noticed right away they completely changed their menu. No longer can you pick your steak sauce and sides, and you are bound by set selections. Not only did they change their main menu, but the chocolate cake I was so excited to get as dessert has now been changed to a gluten free VEGAN cake! Vegan cake?! Who the heck comes to a steakhouse to order a vegan dessert? Come on Cartwrights why did you change something that was so wonderful? Needless to say I was disappointed in the menu change, and we headed to Mastro's for dessert to have a real chocolate cake.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: They have the best grits in town, in my opinion. However, there other menu items are often flavorless or overcooked. My biscuit was dry and bland, very dense and not fluffy like a good biscuit should be. Also the service tends to be hit or miss. But for the price, it's ok and they do offer a good bit of healthy fare.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I have been eating here since I was a young warthog, and I have never had a bad meal here, the food is out of this world phenomenal, I suggest the shish kabob plate, and the service is awesome as well. When it comes to comfort food, outside of the home kitchen, this is the place. Now quit reading this and go!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This place is GREAT if you're looking for a tasty, quick lunch like a sandwich, burger, or salad. I've been here twice so far. The service is real quick, the food is delicious, and the staff are friendly. Everything is convenient. Fountain drinks are self-served as well as some of the sides (such as pasta salads, fruit cups, etc). Haven't eaten inside yet but I would like to some time, because the place is nice and cozy. A bit short on space, but the interior decor is fun and a good place to eat with a couple other friends. The only thing I'd say is that there isn't a whole lot of variety on toppings for a sandwich or burger, usually just lettuce and tomato. Pretty typical stuff, nothing really \\\"Rusty-unique.\\\" But...maybe I just don't know yet, need to visit more!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Beautiful hotel. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  \\n\\nWhere to begin? \\nThe first night we checked in, Aria charged my friends debit card for the full stay of 4 nights, no it didn't pend- they charged it & she wasn't told nor given a receipt. When in fact they were suppose to use my debit card, because that was the original plan. Another issue was that the amount that was taken, didn't match the price I was given. In the meantime, my friend & I are trying to get her money refunded  and the permission from Aria to release the funds back to her bank account, which took forever because they (aria) kept transferring us to different workers and saying they were going to call the bank and they didn't even do it right away. Finally, the bank called her after hours of waiting, saying they got permission from aria to return my friends money. The worst part was that my friend wouldn't even receive her money right away.. it would be between 1-3 days before she saw her money again. That would basically be our whole stay in Las Vegas. I felt so bad for my friend, but there was really nothing I could do for her.\\n\\nAside from that. We got a weak room on the third floor which is a non smoking floor, but people were smoking anyway--even smoking weed. We had a view of the roof entrance which was crap & even had workers walking on the roof, which caught us by surprise because we were getting ready. We requested a different room, but of course that didn't happen.\\n\\nThey didn't even clean our room one day, even after we requested turn down service by calling. \\nBut one day we did come back and our room door was OPEN for some reason! WTF! Luckily nothing was stolen or missing.\\n\\nWe ate at the CAFE which was crap or at least the philly cheese steak I ordered was. It tasted like cardboard without salt or pepper, but the service at the CAFE was great, just NOT the food.\\n\\nAnother night we were getting ready for bed and an employee entered our room, we didn't request anything and they said they were just checking to see if we needed our room cleaned. Why would we need our room cleaned in the middle of the night? When my friend look outside of our door there was no cleaning cart, so i don't know why that employee went into our room, that was bizarre.\\n\\nI do not wish for anyone to waste their time, money, thoughts on Aria. Maybe in a few years the service will be better.I hope they hire a manager that knows the basics of customer service, because Johnny (who is a woman) doesn't contain the skills required to run a Las Vegas hotel.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Food ok, but Mint is so close, I'm not sure why I'd ever bother again.\\n\\nWait...why DID I come here?  That's right, the yelp \\\"deal.\\\"  They seemed extremely put out to have to handle with my take out order and their annoyance only increased when I mentioned my \\\"deal.\\\"  I apologize that you had to take my money, India Palace...I promise it'll never happen again!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I go to this location once in a while since its closest to my work, the car dealer where I get my service done, and a Trader Joe's. \\n\\nThis one isn't all that different from the other, but its not all that spectacular. I don't really dig how the place is so wide and spread out. Nothing is wrong with the layout, it just feels strange to me. The good part is it does have a few more benches than the Scottsdale road location I usually use, which is a big plus.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I love this place! We come here so much its like Norm walking into Cheers. They have great Sushi and the food is awesome. If you haven't been here you got to try it once. If you try it you will fall in love with how friendly they are here. Come see how good it is!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Good quality food ...\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We had a group of 20 which I knew would be a little problem, but didn't expect to see what happened:  1.  Table was set for 16 - guess 4 of us would sit on the ground, plus not enough silverware for 20 either.  Had to share menus because they didn't have enough.  2.  Food arrived haphazardly and cold.  Had to repeatly ask for silverware making our food get colder and colder.  One of our party was served a salad in a dirty bowl - server took it back and all they did was wipe off the rim - didn't even bother to replate it - big mistake, but manager did make it right by comping her meal.  Server seemed more interested in those of our party drinking bar drinks and keeping them filled because those of us who had soft drinks were never offered refills, even when our glasses were empty!  3.  I'll definately not go back!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Since the renovation, I have had two poor experiences there.  I got turned onto their seasoned chips by a coworker which are wonderful.  \\n\\nWhen they were freestanding in front of Quail Corners the service was excellent.  I could pass up a $5 bag of Lay's Tostito's at Harris Teeter for a huge bag of theirs for less than $3 being in and out before my groceries started defrosted.\\n\\nWith the new layout, there is no way to \\\"jump the line\\\" if all you're getting is chips.  I have spent upwards of 15 to 20 minutes shuffling down the line after saying all I wanted was a bag of chips to go behind other customers having their order assembled.\\n\\nBottom line, love the chips but hate being subjected to a cafeteria line just to get them and pay.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Great place to go if you don't want to wait for a table at the other food spots.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: You absolutely, positively CANNOT beat the prices!  \\n\\nI usually take my 2 chihuahuas to VCA Spring Mountain but when they're charging north of $400 to get spayed and another $400 for teeth cleaning, $90 for spay and $150 for dental cleaning is MUSIC TO MY EARS!  You can also add on services like nail clipping and anal gland squeezing.  Vaccines are only $12.  \\n\\nMake an appointment and then bring your dog in sometime between 7am and 8am the day of.  They can either call you or text you when your dog will be done.  The staff is really friendly, informative and helpful.  If it weren't for this location being on the other side of LV for me, I would make this my go to veterinarian.    \\n\\nHopefully this will be the last time I use the word \\\"anal\\\" in a Yelp review.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This place really surprised me. So peaceful and relaxing inside, the private rooms were excellent, the beds even have a heater if you want that option, and my masseuse was great. Seriously, Im surprised it can be this good for so little cost. Will definitely be coming back.\\n\\nThe two downsides to my experience were 1) i waited half an hour for my 6oclock appointment, and 2) I was quoted $25 per person over the phone since we had a large party, but when we went to pay, they charged $30 per person. Just a little irksome.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I had the worst experience of my life back in January. \\n\\nI booked an appointment with CWH because I found out I was pregnant Christmas day. The front staff was so rude on the phone. The girl I spoke to treated me like I was an inconvenience and how dare I call in to book an appointment. I should have cancelled at this point but I was excited with this being my first pregnancy. \\n\\nOn the day of my appointment I had to wait over an hour for my appointment to start. Then once I was taken back I had to wait another 30 mins for someone to see me in my room. Tracy came and was the nurse practitioner. She was amazing but I hear she is not longer with them. \\n\\nNow to the tragic part. I informed them that I would be having my 8 yr old son come in for the ultra sound because we were trying to make him feel like his apart of the process. Dr. Nelson came in. Dr. Nelson has no bedside manner what so ever. He proceeded to tell me right in front of my son that I was going to miscarry. He drop the bomb with little to no bedside manner. He could have asked my son to step out and then tell me. Then he walked out with out explaining anything and basically just dipped out. \\n\\nObviously I was devastated. I came back two days later to give blood work . Again the front staff was rude and dismissive. The girl told me that they MIGHT call me back the next day and if not give them a call whenever. I don't feel this is satisfactory for someone who is terrified waiting to hear if there baby is not going to make it. \\n\\nI ended up going with another OBGYN to have my medically induced miscarriage. CWH with out a phone call to follow up with me proceeded to send me a $7000.00 bill for a pregnancy that they deemed was not viable in the first place. You would think it would have been written down somewhere that I was no longer going to need prenatal care after I told them I was going to go somewhere else, my new doctor's office called them, and they DIAGNOSED my miscarriage.\\n\\nOver all this place is extremely unprofessional and is not a good choice for a first time mom or any mom. They obviously do not have the bedside manner to deal with a difficult pregnancy or with a woman who has to deal with a difficult decision.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Apparently this place is well-known for their wines, but we did not have a chance to try it.  My friends and I were super tired and wanted to eat somewhere for dinner before going out so we decided to stay at the hotel and check out one of the restaurants. By chance, we gave D.O.C.G. Enoteca a try. Their food was not bad, but not exceptional. Their salads are tiny and really pricey. Definitely not for sharing. I do recommend their pizzas, however.  We ordered one measly two-bite salad and two pizzas among 5 girls and it came out to about $60.   The service here was not as great either. Our server was nice, but very nonchalant and did not seem to be too happy to be either serving us, or working, or both? We compared the outgoing, loud server to ours at the next table and were surprised at the different experience the other diners were having near us.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: It's steep so you get some good exercise going up the Playfair Steps. The Assembly towering up is very impressive and you can see down over the Scottish National Gallery and Princes Street. I really hate it in the winter when it's icey though.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Dr. Natalie is amazing.I had some neck issues and after seeing the many great reviews on here I settled on her. I was super nervous since I'd never been to a chiro before, and she was pretty good at telling me exactly what was going to happen and put me at ease. After only TWO visits she had me being able to move my neck! I was amazed! Long story short, I'll continue visiting her as needed.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The prices knocked us back a bit, but the flavors were worth it. I fell in love with something simple as the fried scalloped potatoes (largely because of the duck fat), and the charcuterie plate was standard but good. We all raved about the house red wine, which is quite a deal at $20/bottle, and came out to about two glasses each.\\n\\nIt was charming, and felt just like a real French bistro, with tables spilling out onto the cobblestoned street. They were very accommodating, though we walked in forty minutes before closing.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: -----------------------More Like Sweet TomaNO's-------------------\\n\\nThis Location has major cleanliness issues.\\nMy family went in one night looking for a light dinner and what we found was stomach turning.\\n\\nThe Red trays at the start of the salad line were filthier than Red Foxx!\\nWe took tray after tray from the pile and they were clumped with wet napkins and food, as if the staff had just piled them in the dishwasher without removing the former diners debris, and they just got wet , not cleaned. I mean come on, PILES of these things were literally clumped with nasty wet used napkins! I finally found a napkin spitwad-free tray and \\\"Thought\\\", \\\"oh I found a clean one guys\\\", NO.... It had weird black grease on it, so we all just left assuming if they cant get cleanliness down by the tray phase , then it would probably be best to not risk illness with the rest of the establishment. Buffet style restaurants NEED cleanliness , or its just plain foul.\\n\\nNo thanks, Ill pass on the 10$ a plate funk-athon.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This is not the salon I typically go to, and I don't have unreasonable standards when it comes to a manicure/pedicure.  I had a gift certificate for man/ped, so I chose this location to redeem it.  The staff is friendly and there are many colors to choose from.  However, the floor looks like the way a night club might look at the end of the night when the lights come on.  Slick and dirty.  The tools used to scrape and trim my feet and were not clean, the water in my foot bowl was cold, and I truly could have done a better job myself.  The man who did my feet was harsh and hurt quite a bit. \\n\\n I hate to give such a negative review, but I would warn others of this particular salon.  I can't speak for the other locations.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This is my usual grocery store- especially for produce.\\n\\nPros:\\nProduce\\nBulk dry goods\\nOrganic stuff\\n\\nCons:\\nRestocked during the day\\nSometimes I see moldy produce here\\n\\nI hate it when I forget my reusable bags since you get 5 cents off for each one you use.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: AWESOME. Don't waste your time walking up and down State Street trying to decide where to eat... go STRAIGHT to Takara. We were so impressed... the food is creative, refined and delicious. HIGHLY recommended.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Ooey Gooey Cinnamon Bun - that flavor alone is worth 4 stars.  Trust me.  The price is a little higher than Menchie's, but I found the flavors to be a lot richer and, well, flavorful!  This is my new favorite froyo place.  Why? Ooey Gooey Cinnamon Bun!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Gross, this place is gross. It is cheap, but that is obviously for a reason. Some fast food places nearby are even worse, & not even as cheap though, so no surprise they are still in business. What is it about fast food places not serving healthy food, seriously what is so slow about an apple, or banana? Healthy alternatives to what this place serves up may even be more affordable in some cases, organic bananas sell for 69 cents a pound nearby. For those who believe depopulation is necessary, this place is highly recommended for you first.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I ate the \\\"Value Gyros Meal\\\" which consisted of a Gyros, fries and a fountain drink.. The fries were fresh and well done with no greasy taste.. the fountain drink was fine... but I came for the Gyros and what can I say.. the portion was ample but the meat was lacking in taste and a good gyro's got taste.. and as they say..\\\"the Chef is in the sauce\\\" and honestly the yogurt and cucumbers were barely discernible on the gyro.. Having lived in the area of Tarpon Springs, Florida for 25 years I ate a lot of good gyros and this was not one.. There are better ones in the Valley..\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Pretty decent for airport nachos. The $7 coronas are cold but come on. Oh yeah - it's in the airport.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I am writing this review strictly on the cupcakes, I have not and do not wish to try anything else, but the cupcakes are amazing.  \\n\\nMy friends and I had a cupcakes and champagne party for my birthday - everyone brought cupcakes from different places around town for a side-by-side taste test and Tammie Coe's Ooey Gooey's won hands down.  Warning: If you do not like frosting, you will not like Tammie Coe's Cupcakes.  There isn't a ton of frosting, but a fair amount so if you are one of those that likes scant amounts of frosting, this isn't for you. \\n\\nOther notables from Tammie are the Coconut and Red Velvet - they are always crowd pleasers.  Great frosting, great cake and wonderful colors/designs, Tammie Coe's are great to take or have at a party....or even have LGO deliver to your car on your way home from work. :)\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Their thin crust pizza is really good.  The crust is a little thicker and \\\"doughier\\\" than most, and the sauce is very tasty. \\n\\nIf you like hot wings, try their hot wing pizza...it's pretty good!\\n\\nI also thought their hot wings were pretty good for a pizza joint.  Their boneless wings were so-so.\\n\\nOverall, it's one of the better pizza places in the East Valley.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I'm glad I am writing a review now, because this place won't be in business very long.\\n\\nLet me do start on a positive note; Cecelia is a very good and personable server.\\n\\nThat's about it. \\n\\nAs you can discern from the name of the place, it is very Gringo.\\n\\nI ordered a combo plate of Tamale, Chile Relano, and Carne Asada Taco. \\nThe taco was better than Taco Bell or Del Taco, but not as good as fast food favorite, La Mexicana and not even in the ball park with Taco's Del Gordo.\\n\\nThe Tamale was dry, and nowhere in the class of Dona Maria's, or for that matter, any decent catering truck. \\n\\nThe Chile Relano, was soggy, and low on cheese.\\n\\nVery Gringo, and I'm with Heather as it was very disappointing.\\n\\nI had a \\\"buy one, get one free coupon\\\", and I wish I had never used it. \\n\\nA free meal doesn't always taste better.\\n\\nNo returno!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: YUCK! I ordered general Tsos, Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup. I used to like this place. It tasted like my food was 5days old. It definitely wasn't fresh. The hot and sour soup tasted like dirty muddy water with Siracha added to it to spice it up. The general Tsos chicken was disgusting. It was all breading and no chicken. The sauce they used was gross. My dogs wouldn't eat it. The only thing that was 1/2 decent was the Mongolian beef. It was edible but the beef was gummy. They made Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. I really think my food was prepared like several weeks ago and RE heated and served to me. Ughhhh...now I have to search for another Chinese take out place.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The good: The rooms are nice (especially the 2 room suites) and very clean. The hotel is in a good location, right across the street from the Westgate Center and University of Phoenix stadium.\\n\\nThe bad: Internet is wireless but extremely slooooooww. I think dial up is faster. You can pay for \\\"premium\\\" wireless internet (very pricey) but it's not worth the cost. I decided to pay for the \\\"premium\\\" service only to find out that there is no noticeable difference between the free and \\\"premium\\\" internet.  I called the front desk to complain and they credited back my account.\\n\\nThe outside patio and pool area is very nice but it's shared with the Spring Hill hotel directly across, therefore, it always seems to be busy with kids running wild.\\n\\nOverall, it was just ok for me.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This is a huge favorite I have been going to for years.  The dive bar next door is a great place that only serves beer, has great bartenders and sometimes rocks live music - and you can sit in there and they will bring your food over.  Or take out or dine in their area.\\n  Now for the food, at first all I would get was a shredded beef burrito- enchilada style.  They do it right.  Then I saw someone with a steak quesadilla one night and we have been hooked on those ever since.  And I never order quesadillas - not something I generally dig - but the way they do it - with the cheeses they use - fresh, peppery steak, epic.  Their red salsa that is on the bar - not the hot - but the one with bits of cillantro in it - I don't know what they do to that but it's just wonderful and has a great flavor.  The shredded chicked in the tacos or burritos is always flavorful marinated mostly white meat.  The fish tacos are excellent.  They also make a chicken finger taco in a simelar style to fish and it is a uniqly addictive treat - especially for late night folks.  And that reminds me - they have a midnight special- after 12 they have a list of dishes you can get that comes with two beers from next door for $5.  The best deal going anywhere!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: My brother and I visited Bily Kun during a recent long weekend in Montreal. We took the Metro to the Mont Royal stop and it dropped us off right near the place. It was a very cool spot, crowded with locals. We probably stood out like sore thumbs but the bartender was very welcoming and even came around the bar and did a shot with us , of what he explained was some sort of  Czech cinammon schnapps. We also indulged in a 20 oz. Tchech-bec. A beer that he explained is only available at Bily Kun. It is brewed in Czech, dehydrated, shipped to Montreal and then re-hydrated with local Quebec spring water. Delicious ! Take the trip and enjoy the atmosphere at Bily Kun !\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I purchased three rooms from theses guys. Byron Copeland was referred from a friend. Unbelievable the experience I had and am still having...\\n\\nWhen I checked in for reservation, it showed that it was not paid for and hotel told me we had to pay again! Byron never responded to my phone calls until after the weekend was over! Fu$& up! Gave me some run around about how it was some wholesale mistake and his office was closed. You don't own a hospitality business in Vegas that is closed over the weekends! F'n ridiculous. Super embarrassing to tell twelve of my best friends that, apparently it has not been paid for yet! I showed email receipt to concierge, but since there was no confirmation number, nothing they could do. No confirmation number! Also a big red flag as to how shady this mofo is. \\n\\nSaid he was going to refund my card, which took a week, but the refund was processed as a charge and not a refund! Going to have to dispute with amex and fraud dep. the entire amount. ridiculous. \\n\\nShady shady unprofessional business. This dude is a joke, the office number online has been disconnected and I haven't been able to get a hold of him. This guy ruined my best friends bachelor party weekend and still has me in fights with my friends. \\n\\nDO NOT BOOK with these guys! Super shady, unprofessional, full of sh*t, and illegal business activities. I am in the hospitality business for a living, so this review should serve you well. \\n\\nA+ Better Business Bureau rating my ass!!!\\n\\nStill have not heard from him or gotten my refundS\\n\\nF$?* Vegas Hotel Escapes!\\n\\n\\n-Jon\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Had an MRI done here on an early Saturday morning. Facilities are clean, well maintained, & convenient free parking. What I didn't like was walking into the office to be greeted by a gentleman who was sitting at his desk eating a McDonalds deluxe breakfast with his pancakes and eggs spread all over his computer area. Totally unprofessional. And smelled like a fast food joint, I know it's a Saturday but come on. My insurance is paying big money for this test at least offer me the coffee that was brewed. He also failed to mention I needed to undress from the top, he seemed totally distracted, probably didn't want his food to get cold.  \\nThe technician was awesome & made me feel extremely comfortable. I was very nervous after that first impression in the front but she eased my fears.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I had a decent experience overall.  I stayed for four nights while attending a conference at the University of Illinois, and the price was reasonable -- not a fantastic deal or anything, but a fair value.\\n\\nI'll start with the good stuff.  First of all, their free breakfast is the best I've ever seen at this kind of hotel; they have the standard cereals and pastries and stuff, but they also make custom omelets and hot dishes like home fries, bacon, and sausage, and the coffee is totally decent.  They have a free shuttle to and from the airport, and if you ask nicely, they can sometimes be convinced to shuttle you to other places, like your conference venue.  The rooms are pretty spacious, and they have soaps and shampoos and stuff from Bath and Body Works, which is a step up from the usual.  Oh, and I saw another reviewer complain that there was no wireless in the rooms, but there is now -- I had no trouble connecting.\\n\\nNow for the not so good.  The walls are apparently paper thin, as I could clearly listen to my neighbors' televisions, discussions, phone calls, and erotic encounters.  The bathroom is incredibly tiny.  And what the hell is up with the water pressure?  I get that they're trying to be green and conserve and all that, but it is not possible to thoroughly wash and rinse one's hair with what amounts to a fine mist spraying lightly from the shower head. \\n\\nOh, and one other thing.  This place managed to screw up my reservations TWICE, despite the fact that I was travelling for a conference that had a whole block of rooms reserved, presumably for the correct dates.  I called to confirm a few days before my trip, and they had my dates all wrong.  I had them fix it, but I was suspicious, so I called to confirm AGAIN the day before I left, and guess what?  Wrong again.  Seriously.  I'd probably give the place four stars, honestly, if it weren't for the difficulty making reservations.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I'm so sad to read allll the bad reviews about this place. Either they have really stepped up their game or you guys are talking about a different clinic! \\n\\nDr Parker and Rachel were excellent! They made Harvey and I completely comfortable, worked with him even though he has some aggressive issues (and gave pointers!), answered my questions, examined him for the issue at hand (that is what I prefer in doctors) and I will absolutely be back if we need them :)\\n\\nI have been to many different vets, Petsmart, on base, even other civilian clinics.. No one has ever treated Harvey as well as Rachel & Dr Parker. I recommend these two for anyone else weary about this clinic.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I just stumbled upon this place this Feb, I can't believe it's been here 20yrs, and I've never been.

{"prompt": "Sentence: My burger had a fried egg in it, totally hit the spot after a night of drinking. The vanilla milkshake was probably the most delicious item there. The fries were delicious when dipped into the chipotle ketchup sauce. The decor was a lil boring but the food was great.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We had the Shogun burger, salt and pepper garlic fries, and chili fried chicken. \\n\\nShogun burger was just okay. It was very plain, and came with a little plum of some sort which did little to enhance the dish. The flavors were not at all complimentary. There was nothing that stood out about the meal AND you have to order your fries separately.\\n\\nI ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries because I love garlic and expected the salt and pepper to add a little kick. Ok...there was no garlic but there was a generous amount of ginger, which I really didn't expect. It was also under seasoned with salt and pepper. \\n\\nMy chili fried chicken was extremely salty. On the salty scale of one to 10, it was at an 8. They were also not as crispy as much as they were soggy and oily. \\n\\nOverall I was disappointed. I heard about this place on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives. That being said, I wasn't expecting to be blown away but I certainly expected a decent meal.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Our first visit to this store was to go to the bakery to see if we could order a last minute carrot cake for a birthday the next day.  The staff was friendly and helped us right away - No problem!\\n\\nWe picked it up on time and we were shocked at how low the price was.  It was THE BEST carrot cake we have ever eaten!  It was for a 6 year old's birthday and the kids wolfed it down and wanted more.  The adults were shocked at the value.\\n\\nActually it is now the next morning and we just ate some leftovers (breakfast dessert is ok, right?).  Still awesome!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This place was OK but not nearly as good as I thought it'd be. The Wynn is one of only a couple places I stay when I hit up Vegas, so I like it too much to give their buffet a 2 star. So I thought when I dished out $190 for me and 2 others to bypass the massive line and walk right in that the food would kind of blow me away. Wasn't really the case. It was whatever, but not worth the price. I honestly thought the Mirage buffet was much better. I probably would've been much more satisfied just hitting up Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood and saving myself $180. The crab legs were probably the best thing there. Stay away from the Sangria.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Disappointed!!!! My daughter and I went today for the weight loss program. You can only go certain days for this doc as he is the only one who can give the pills. Well after an hour and a half they came in her room and said well the doc left can you come back later or tomorrow, well she was already late for work so she has to go all the way back to their office. They didn't even offer any compensation what so ever for their POOR customer service!!!!\\nYou should be ashamed of yourself Urgent Care Extra!!!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: i'm a fan! \\n\\nthe red velvet pancakes was DELICIOUS. not too sweet, just cooked to perfection. the short stack was just the right amount cause otherwise i'd be in pancake overload. the bf and i also tried the kahlua pork benedict. i wasn't a fan of this dish. the pork was bland and the hollandaise sauce was whatever. the seasoned potatoes was okay, could use more seasoning. hah. overall, if it wasn't for the red velvet pancakes, i probably wouldn't go back.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Sometimes you're better off with a happy memory of something than the reality of how things are in the present. I haven't been in Madison for a while, but remember how much I liked the food and service when I was a starving student and they were pretty much the only place on State Street that wasn't serving Gyros, Burgers, or Pizza. \\n\\nOur party arrived around 7PM, midweek. It wasn't crowded- there were maybe three other people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes or so for anyone to greet us. When we were seated, our tables hadn't been bussed and we had to ask for someone to clean them and bring us some menus. Things picked up when we finally got a waitress to notice us. The food arrived fairly quickly- I had a combo platter of soft tacos, with mole on the side. The tortillas and fixings were good for the most part, but the beans and rice were dried up to the extent where I wondered if it had ever been cooked completely, or just sat out somewhere for a few days. After getting our food, the waitstaff vanished. No water, no follow-up, no nothing. We actually had to look around for someone to give us our bill. Well, someone else's bill. We did get things straightened out, but sheese, how can you not want to get paid what you're owed?\\n\\nI probably won't ever come back again if they're somehow still in business next time I'm in the area. All in all, a very disappointing visit.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I'm not much of an Asian foodie but came to check out this new little place. Since pizza is not very Asian I went for that and I must say I was pleasantly surprised as it was so tasty and delightful!  And a girl gotta have her desert so I chose the 5 Spice Carrot cake...OMG it was amazing!! The staff was the best part so helpful and a joy to be around, really enjoyed my time at BBD!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The food and ambiance at Stack were great, however where they excel in food, they lack in service. The 3 star rating is based purely on the food. \\n\\nWhen we were seated, it took the server a bit of time to greet us. When she approached the table, she seemed a lilttle overwhelmed. There was a quick introduction of herself and her partner. We ordered drinks and they took a while to get to us - our friends weren't drinking and only got soda and that seemed to take a while as well. Once we ordered our apps and meals, we didn't see the server for a while. We wanted another round of drinks, but since we never saw her, we weren't able to order a second round. She didn't even deliver our entrees, it was her partner along which another gentlemen. When my boyfriend received his steak, he commented on how large it was. Her partner (I wish I remembered his name) stated people usually don't expect it to be as big as it is. A few minutes later, the server approached the tabled and asked my boyfriend if he wanted the steak for a single or 2 people. Before he could answer, she stated she forgot to ask. I found this a bit odd. My boyfriend said he ordered the dry-rubbed steak and she immediately knew it was for a single, but it wasn't what she entered as the order. She simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away. \\n\\nWhen we received our check, we were charged for the steak for 2.  My boyfriend didn't want to make a big deal about it, so he went ahead and just paid the bill.  As her partner came to run our card, my friend was going to say something, but ended up stopping mid-sentence. Her partner, noticed there was some awkwardness and stated he knew what we were debating about and said he would fix it. He clearly read our cues and responded quickly. He ended up bringing the check back without charging us for my boyfriends steak on it and apologized for the inconvenience and mistake that took place. We thought it was a bit much, but he insisted. We were floored by his customer service for a mistake he didn't cause. As I was signing the check, the female server came back and said she was going to fix the check. When I stated her partner had already taken the initiative to fix the check, she stated that he didn't know what he was doing  and didn't know what was going on. She removed the check presenter and went back to charge us for the steak. Basically - threw her partner under the bus. \\n\\nLet me make it clear, we didn't care to have to pay for the steak, but the customer service aspect of this server was frustrating. Her partner was wonderful, but she just seemed to busy and overwhelmed the hostess should have probably stopped seating her. We still tipped 20%, but only to ensure her partner would get his fair cut. After the initial mistake, she never once apologized nor seemed to care that she made a mistake and failed to provide great service.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So my buddy's wife accidentally knocked over 2 beers. The girl working the bar, Dawn, would not replace them. It was a complete accident. It's understandable that she did not believe me, however Vegas bars give away free drinks all night long. To bit replace our beers after an honest mistake is absolutely ridiculous. Dawn should have incorporated her manager to find the root of the situation and provide good customer service by offering to romance the beers. She did not ask any questions. She just said I could purchase more beers as a solution. No thanks. On to Monte Carlo.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: The atmosphere, the service and the food were are all fantastic!! We were there last Tuesday and the weather was still cool outside. You walk inside and there is a cozy, inviting fireplace. \\n\\nWe took the recommendation of our waiter and started with the goat cheese & artichoke flat bread. It was so thin & crispy with the right amount of toppings that did not weigh it down. I had the mesquite grilled garlic shrimp that came with polenta and asparagus. The shrimp were topped with some sort of diced, cured meat and green olives. I don't eat meat so I picked it out. The olives added a nice saltiness. If you are on a low sodium diet I would not recommend this dish. My husband had the steak & scallops, it wasn't on the menu but our fabulous waiter told us about it. \\n\\nWe finished off the meal with a pecan pie mousse and a key lime pie, both were delicious and very, very sweet.\\n\\nI love that Seasons does not have fried food on the menu, all dishes are less than 250 calories and they offer a wide variety of seasonal and vegetarian dishes. I look forward to the spring menu.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: For $20 I feel I got ripped the fuck off. For a third of the price, I could have got two subs at jimmy johns. Whack. Dude took a $3 tip then spilled my soda. Oh. And dude also didn't bring me a fork, so I had to wash a fucking dish. Fuck that.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: My experience was beyond exceptional . The service was great. I felt welcomed , and the tasting course was a beautiful artful expression of food made with class. Flavors were there and you are not leaving hungry . The plates are small but they keep them coming ! I truly enjoyed this restaurant and will be back !\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: For the longest time I thought this place was called The Brass Rail. (insert gay bar joke here) It's actually not a bad place to chill with friends.  Totally unpretentious downtown Las Vegas lounge, just as it should be.  It's not hard to find.  Just look for the comically oversized \\\"world's largest pint glass\\\" toward the end of the Fremont Street Experience and head upstairs.  On weekends there's usually a DJ spinning, making it easy to do a little dancing.  But if you just want to head out to the patio and check out the balcony view, that's cool too.  I'm only giving this place 3 stars because it's nothing spectacular, but it is a little more fun than going to your neighborhood bar.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Completely tasteless broth... maybe it was water.\\n\\nGo to Lemongrass down the street.\\n\\nVery dissapointing.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: If it is not allowed for people to park in the handicap parking lot, why is it okay for people to sit on a handicap seats.. And there are tons of open seats out there...\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: i hate to give this place only two stars because the service was great and the atmosphere was very cute.  i wanted to like it, but the truth is i was very disappointed. \\n\\nthe food was NOT great, especially for the prices!\\n\\nwe started with the strawberry avocado salad, which was okay, but i could have made it at home in about 2 minutes, and the dressing was nothing special. \\n\\ni got the garbanzo bean stew, but apparently they were out of garbanzo beans so they asked if some other bean was okay. when it came it was luke warm and looked like they poured these white beans out of the can  5 minutes before. gross. and it said it came with \\\"eggplant pilaf,\\\" which ended up being regular rice with maybe one tiny smidge of spice for color, with one tiny chunk of eggplant which got lost under the white bean stuff. \\n\\nmy boyfriend got the seafood soup and it looked watery and unexciting. there were a few chunks of carrots and peas floating around in there, with not enough seafood. \\n\\nsorry, bon appetit. i still think you're cute, but i'm not coming back. \\n\\n(i heard through the grapevine that the chef is moody and if he's in a good mood then the food will be great but it's always a gamble, so you never know what you're going to get).\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place is the epitome of diamond in the rough. Back in my underage days, a few girlfriends and myself ventured to our friendly neighbor to the north for spring break (we couldn't afford sun) and made it to the city of Montreal. We met a local on the Metro and he gave us the suggestion to hit Bifteck.\\n\\nI can safely say, we had one of the most fun nights of all time. This bar was amazing for making new friends, Molson Export flowed like water, and the drink specials were unreal. I'm not sure how they are now, but screw it, they have free popcorn and plenty of TV's. They had these 5 for $5 shot specials going on with risque names for the shots, which only got funnier the more you drank them.\\n\\nAlso, to all the womenfolk, this bar for some reason attracts the best looking men. This bar was SO much fun, that the next night we went out dancing, and all we wanted to do was go back to Bifteck for more drink specials, friendly great looking people and awesome bartenders.  This is a bar that I will never forget and fully intend to revisit each time I travel back to Quebec.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I never realized how much fat this place packs into their food until I really had to look.  For being Chinese, what the hell??  \\n\\nIt's nice that they have their nutritional values online, but so scary because then you realize what you're actually eating.\\n\\nTastes mighty great tho.\\n\\nService is ok at this location... it's been a hit or miss.  The prices are WAY too high.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We struck out big-time here. We were introduced to the original \\\"Original Pancake House\\\" in Portland, where this chain started. The breakfasts there were sublime. The breakfasts at this outpost were at the opposite end of the spectrum. We shared a Denver omelette, that was 50% more cheese than egg. Not only that, it was tiny and hardly had any veggies or ham. They charged us around $9 for this omelette. I'll happily pay that much for an omelette at the original OPH in Portland, because they are delicious and have more eggs than cheese. The chocolate pancakes were OK, but how can you not have excellent choco pancakes? This is a no-fail recipie...\\n\\nIt's also good to know where to park. This seemed like it was hidden in the back corner of the building, about 1/2 mile from our car. I hope there are closer parking spaces than we found...\\n\\n(I originally posted this review for the other location of this place in Las Vegas - my error)\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Ready to listen to the middle schoolers rock out in band!  Here we are in 117 degree heat to check out a bunch of 5 year old hip hop ballet stars.  This is so cool.\\n\\nThe UNLV Performing Arts Center and Hamm Hall is AMAZING.\\n\\na.  Parking - Huge parking structure right next to Hamm Hall, great for the heat and so close to the center. Amazingly convenient. Who could have planned this better?\\n\\nb.  The Facility - Awesome seating. Every row and seat has the right amount of space.  The acoustics and sound is balanced.  The views are all great from all seats.  This is first class.\\n\\nc.  The Stage - Just right, esy to see, and the right size for a variety of events.\\n\\nThis is 4 star across the board. If you ever are invited to an event here, you will be happy with the facility.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: After an afternoon at Hillend, The Steading is an attractive proposition. Right next door and offering a decent looking menu of 'pub fayre' and beers.\\n\\nThe beers are good. They have a few real ales on tap and frequently rotate. Unfortunately their ales are warm. Not just 'cellar cool' (which is ideal) but warm. Which might have something to do with the radiators being on at full heat all the time.\\n\\nThe menu is nicely varied. But when I say it offers 'pub fayre' that is exactly what I mean. Maybe even being a little generous. I have been two times now. On the first occasion I had mediterranean 'Vegetable Skewers with Cous Cous'. It was incredibly bland, I don't know how it's possible but even the chargrilled onion was absent of any flavour. The rest of the plate was just as unremarkable, if i'm being kind. \\n\\nSecond time  I ordered the 'Tuna Nicoise'. It was a definite improvement on the veg skewers. Consisting of a very generous serving of lettuce, baby potatoes, a few green beans, one boiled egg, masses of pickled anchovies, a mountain of tuna and a smattering of vinaigrette. All of which, without doubt, came out of a tin/packet/bottle/jar. 'Meh' sums it up.\\n\\nPleasant, but not worth recommending.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I am from the East Coast and this is the closest to what we get back East for excellent Chinese Food!  Every other place I tried since moving here was horrible!  Staff is super friendly and after going here only for a few weeks begins to recognize you!  It has become a weekly outing!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Jordan's is seconds away from my office and I was craving cheap, run-of-the-mill Mexican food so we ran to Jordan's real fast. Expecting the typical Mexican restaurant with the typical wooden booths and plastic covered seats, I was surprised to find the interior was actually really nice. I was even more surprised to find the menu prices weren't as nice. Looking to spend no more than $7 on some tacos and rice and beans, I wasn't thrilled when I saw entrees for $12-$15.\\n\\nLuckily they have a killer (but limited) lunch menu for $5.95. To your table in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Of course, it came out in less than 14 minutes. And it was pretty good. I should have asked for soft tacos instead of hard but the meat was good and the toppings were decent. The salsa was odd though. I'm used to thick and chunky but this salsa reminded me of pasta sauce and that was odd but I ate it.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: If I could give no stars I would. Danielle was horrible.

We came here annoyed, hungover, burnt out. The table took MUCH longer than promised but once we sat down, all was great. The server we had was amazing! He was such a sweet guy. All of the servers were great actually. I got the prix fix $40- DO IT! Its everything on the menu and so MUCH FOOD! If you like a particular item, they will keep bringing you more.

It seems to be mostly locals and a slightly older crowd as a result.  They have some pretty good acts that come through here, and people usually get enthusiastic enough to dance to the music too.  Why only 3 stars then?  I would actually like to give 3.5 stars.  It's better than OK, but not amazing. It's casual and comforting, but there's nothing particularly special about it to me.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I tried the sesame chiken and got food poisoning.

The Eggs Benedict Maricopa with sausage sans Canadian Bacon are fantastic.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The sandwiches are pretty good, I believe I had the Ham & Swiss on my last trip there. The food portions are bigger than I can eat and the sandwiches are nice and melty. The shop itself is small- order at the counter and they'll call out when your order is ready.\\n\\nSubFactory isn't my favorite sandwich shop, and I probably wouldn't ever pick this place to eat, but I wouldnt be opposed to going if someone else wanted to.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Went here for the first time when my parents came in to visit for the weekend. We had originally planned to go to the Old Fashioned because I'd heard so much about it, but the wait was over 1.5 hours! We all LOVED Graze. My parents are really picky about loud places, and we found this place to be not loud at all. I've read some other reviews complaining about the noise and it makes me wonder if we were in the same restaurant? We had an easy 30 minute wait, during which time we sat at the bar and conversed with the bartenders over wine and their homemade bread basket ($4). My mom was super impressed with the bartender, who seemed to notice that she has been deciding between some red wine and their seasonal punch, and brought her a generous sample of their punch on the house. The entrees that we got were the mac and cheese with pork ($12), pork3 ($22), and trout (maybe $18? can't remember). We had nothing but praise for all of these! They were all fantastic and we were very impressed. The food being from local farms only added to the experience. Everyone was very friendly and not pretentious.\\n\\nNot sure about the other low reviews on here, but we had  fantastic time. We were glad the Old Fashioned was full so we got to try this place instead.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We have dined at WCG about 20 times in the past and it has usually been a consistently good experience, regarding service and quality of food.\\nFast forward to tonight.....our 7th anniversary.  Hubby says lets go celebrate at WCG.. Usually this would be an instant YES....but after our last visit there, I am reluctant and hesitant to go, but willing to give it another try.................\\nWait staff is always excellent and attentive.  We always order the same meal.  Mine is Salmon (perfectly grilled salmon)... Hubby is French dip sandwich with fries. \\nI order a 1/2 salad this time and broccoli ...al dente' which I have to explain to the watiress is just barely cooked and crisp (after a blank stare when I say Al dente').\\nDinner is served...............no salad, and the broccoli is overcooked and mushy, with way too much seasoning and not acceptable.  Salmon is getting smaller and smaller each visit as is hubby's sandwich which is the incredible shrinking machine, along with miniscule fries that used to be heaping!!\\nHello waitress.............the broccoli is not acceptable and with apologies, another order of broccoli appears by another server we have never seen before.  The difference in what was served with the fish and the plate brought out is huge!!  I ask to see the manager because the difference is worth noting.   She agrees with our issues and apologizes as well as agreeing it was not up to standards.\\nWe finish our meal and the waitress approaches and acknowledges our anniversary and offers a desert.  We refuse as we were not planning on having desert and were full.  She brings us the bill and they have taken off the dinner, only charging for the drinks.  Now we feel guilty as we told the manager we did not expect anything other than knowing we could come here and have a great consistent dinner as we have experienced in the past.  We pay the bill and tip for the full amount.  Waitress is busy and possibly avoiding us?  Not sure, but feeling pretty uncomfortable by now.\\nWill we come back.... hmm, good question.... I guess trying for the third time is the charm type of thing is what we will strive for, but at this moment, not too sure.\\nQuestion????  Why is it so difficult to have quality control in the kitchen??  Maybe if the person taking the order would also serve the food, they could make certain the order was filled properly and the customer was satisfied.  That might help.  \\nLike I said before, the service has always been good, Just wish the quality of the food would remain what it has been in the past.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Not to pleased with this visit.  We aren't sure if we will come back to this location.  \\n\\nTo start we ordered the crispy rice app,  which never showed up and had to ask about at the end of our meal.  She said she was sorry and forgot to put the order in.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Lotus Roll, the first time we ate here it was our absolute favorite roll.  This time to our disappointment the lobster was under cooked and even a couple pieces were completely cold in the middle. \\n\\nNext we ordered the seafood hibachi and asked if we may substitute the clams with more shrimp.  Which they said would not be a problem.  The menu pictured 6 shrimp on a skewer and they showed up with only 6 pieces.  I asked about the extra shrimp and she apologized and said she would be right back with it.  10 min later she came back and said it only comes with 4 and they added 2 more.  Then proceeded to change the subject quickly and ask my date about here hair color and advice on coloring hair. \\n\\nIt was just a poor experience overall.  Very disappointing for our 2nd visit and we don't really have interest in going back a third time.  Especially that location.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: If you are looking for a wall of good beer, a  lengthy list of tasty wing flavors and bartenders who actually seem like they give a hoot I suggest you head down to Sutton House.\\n\\nParking may seem a bit rough, but be informed, you can park in the Berrybrook Farms lot after hours. They have roughly infinity TVs including in each booth, so as they claim on their FB page, your game is always on. \\n\\nThe wings are nice a meaty and they have upwards of two dozen sauces, all that I've tried were tasty though be warned their hottest is a touch chunky. If you are a fan of the craft beer you won't be disappointed. They rock the likes of Southern Tier, Founders &  Great Lakes, but if you need big 3 beer they have it too.\\n\\nI have never gotten anything but chummy service. The kind that makes you want to pull up a stool and spend a football evening. Sutton House rapidly climbed my game day list and I suggest you add it to yours too.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I find it hard to take the time to write an adequate review about places that bore me so this is all I have: It's not a bad Mexican place; there's simply nothing special about it.

We had been to both locations numerous times and loved the food. The management was very helpful in planning the event, picking out menu items, reserving the private room, etc. At the rehearsal dinner (the night before our wedding) everything went wonderfully, all of our guests had a great time and enjoyed the food... UNTIL 10+ of our guests came down with horrible FOOD POISONING the night of our wedding! Both of my parents, my sister, my fianc\\u00e9's mom, members of the wedding party, and friends from out of town, all became severely ill, to the extent of visiting the hospital emergency room! My family was so ill that they were not able to see family and friends that had come in town for the first time in years.  Once we realized exactly what happened we called and spoke with the restaurant manager who, when first hearing the story, did not seem all that surprised. He offered to speak with his boss and get back to us. When we finally heard back (after having to track him down) he offered to do NOTHING!  Not even an apology!

{"prompt": "Sentence: My girlfriend and I went last night.  She was craving sushi and it was close to our apartment, so we said what the hell.  We have been going to Kabuki off and on for about 2 years, until now.  Never again.  \\n\\nWe ordered a Teriyaki/Tempura platter with 2 rolls, a Spicy Tuna Crunch and Lobster Roll.  Both rolls tasted very 'fishy' which should never be the case.  Even my Beef Teriyaki lacked the punch I was looking for.  The beef was so bland.  The rolls were so loose, that it was almost impossible to eat the whole piece at one time.  It just fell apart.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, I wanted to just leave a $20 because that's about as much as I thought the meal was worth, but ofcourse, you just can't do that.  It's sad, because when I first moved out here, it seemed like Kabuki was pretty damn good.  Having lived most of my life in CA, I know I am spoiled when it comes to sushi.  But this place is just not good any more.\\n\\nToo bad, so sad.....\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Dose moved my husband and I into our Phoenix apartment after a  1700 mile move from Illinois. They finished with a previous job early, so they called to see if they could come to our place early. Even then they didn't need the full 2 hours we booked them for. They were friendly and polite the entire time, even finding time to joke with us despite with arms full of boxes. Loved them and I'll recommend them to anyone moving to the Phoenix area.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: 3 1/2 stars really. The food is fab, but the atmosphere is kinda weird.  Tables are close together and it was fairly bright in there for a steak house. \\n\\nTry the scallops, they are divine. So are the brussel sprouts. \\n\\nCorkage fee is $35\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Meh decent food, it really throws me off when my food isn't Hot, My wifes was on point heat wise but mine was obviously waiting on the side til her's was done, cold toast luke warm everything else witch means the cook has no timing witch means to me you don't take pride in what you do, The service was good though\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I had a Groupon and I wanted to try out the place. It's very clean and has a nice atmosphere. The food was really good, but the prices... Not so much. It costs extra if you wanted to have meat or fish with your pastas. I think it was too over priced. We were the only people there, which also made me question the place. But I can see why there were not that many people. If they just lowered the price a bit, it would attract more customers. Overall, the food was great!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Really! This place is worse than the previous incarnation - Hibachi Grill or whatever it was called. I was hoping that new name/new management = much better buffet. No dice. It was like eating at a bad cafeteria - vegetables oversalted, meat overcooked, and everything just generally bland. And the worst part is the Grand Opening banners are still up. Is this the best it's going to be? It was also quite pricey per person. If I'm paying that much I might as well go to Pacific Seafood Buffet. Pretty pricey but much better quality.\\n\\n\\nMeet the new buffet\\nSame as the old buffet\\n\\n\\nI'll take a bite of the sweet orange chicken\\nTake a bowl of the spicy egg drop soup\\nSmile and grin at the fools all around me\\nPick up my tab and pay\\nJust like yesterday\\nAnd I'll get on my knees and pray\\nWe don't get fooled again\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I have a hard time giving 5 stars but their orange chicken is probably what a miracle taste like. OMG. They run out it's so good. I always call ahead now to make sure they have it. I guess it's because there's a long marinating process.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This is the quintessential mom and pop bar / restaurant on a lake. They specialize in cheap beer and great food. Staff is friendly and down home, but you'd better leave your big-city attitude at home.\\n\\nWe went for a Friday night fish fry. I live in Seattle these days and was not about to miss the opportunity while in town.\\n\\nStarted with a couple of Spotted Cows (on tap!) while the rest drank Miller Lite. (Told ya...) There were five adults plus a 12-year old.\\n\\nWalleye was excellent, the waitress was too. We made reservations and the table was ready well ahead of time. Our one tactical error was sitting in the bar for the view. It was LOUD! Think that the dining room is much quieter.\\n\\nNotice that I am not saying much about the food? Here's the deal:\\n- It was Friday\\n- It was Hot\\n- The beer was Cold\\n- The fish fry was exactly what you would expect in a place like this: great walleye!\\n\\n'Nough said...\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Disappointing...not really what I had in mind. I thought it would be more of a market experience and less of an overpay-for-OK-food experience, so perhaps it was my own prematurely high expectations for this place that did me in.\\n\\nFirst, parking is silly. You either have to park two blocks down, or pay $5 to park in Vincent's lot. No exceptions if you are a paying customer of Vincent's...you've still got to pay for the opportunity and privilege (!) of walking in their door to buy something. I've never seen a business take that stance before. It's not about the $5...it's about the experience of not seeing the \\\"pay to park\\\" sign (honest mistake!) and then getting chased down by the parking lot guy to pay him NOW or ELSE. Even if it was just 25 cents to park, I would have still moved my car, to not give more money than necessary to a place with such weird business practices.\\n\\nIf I had been going there by myself, I would have just called it a day and gone someplace else. I wouldn't have even bothered with a Yelp review, either. BUT... I was meeting up with a group of people and didn't want to miss out on seeing them, so I ended up becoming one of Vincent's customers that day. The combination of being accosted in the parking lot and moving my car two blocks down to just walk right back again, plus the disappointing atmosphere and food quality prompted me to actually get on Yelp for this.\\n\\nI had heard good things about this place and so skipped my usual breakfast in order to brunch here. I was starving. I looked for the least expensive thing I could find (yes, I was still disgruntled about being yelled at in the parking lot, and didn't want to spend too much at this place). Despite being ravenous, I thought the pastry I bought was just kind of OK...and doesn't food usually taste 10x better when you're really hungry?? But it was just.....fine. So I paid $9 for a so-so pastry and an OK cup of coffee. If I wanted to pay $9 for over-hyped mediocrity, I would've gone to Starbucks. And Starbucks wouldn't have kicked me out of their parking lot. \\n\\nAnyway, I suppose if my expectations had been a little lower, and I had know about the parking situation beforehand, it might not have been such a disappointing experience. ON THE PLUS SIDE, I discovered Carmel's down the street after leaving Vincent's, and Carmel's is amazing!!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We went here for my daughter's birthday a few days ago. I was really interested because I've been to some very modernized Red Robin's in my day. The only thing my 4 year old wanted was Mac 'n Cheese and there's is good. \\n\\nWhat do I like? I like the bottomless steak friends (believe me, they are bottomless!) and the bottomless speckled lemonade. Yummy strawberries in the drink itself! \\n\\nTypically the burgers are good and I am picky, but this time mine was under done and that really bothered me. Also, our waitress was not very fast at all. She barely even came and when she did bring more lemonade, she just dropped it by without asking if we needed anything else. \\n\\nThey do have a free sundae for birthdays, but they didn't try to upsale dessert to the rest of the party before bringing it out (they could've made a few more bucks if they had!)\\n\\nOverall, not bad, but I've been to better.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: closed!!!!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: The good egg on Central is a very relaxing peaceful place to go very, I described it as very green I mean there's lots of trees and the outdoor seating area that's really nice there are newer good egg restaurants but I don't think they are as relaxing as this restaurant it is older and could be remodeled a bit but other than that it is an excellent place to go for breakfast once you're done you can go next door to the Starbucks for coffee and the  food has always been excellent at this his location.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Good food, great service, fun atmosphere. \\n\\nThe mussels melt in your mouth. Order extra bread to soak up the delicious wine sauce!  On the specials menu, the Alaskan char was described as somewhere between salmon and trout. Luckily I love both.  It had the flavor of a mild lean salmon filet but the texture of buttery trout.  Served over a potato leek puree, it was delightful.  The portion was enough for two people, but I managed to finish it all.  The garlic spinach was nothing to write home (or here) about.  Sadly, no room for dessert.  The waiter had perfect timing, and was unhurried, friendly, gracious, and helpful.\\n\\nSitting on the patio, the fountains across the street provided spectacular visuals.  In between the choreographed water art, people-watching took center stage.\\n\\nMy only criticism was the hostesses were a little snotty and the bar service was a bit disorganized.  Arrived about 15 minutes late and they acted very irritated and wouldn't promise seating.  Waited another 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention.  Finally, the restrooms on the casino floor (there were none in the restaurant) were trashed with broken fixtures, paper and garbage everywhere, and a long line.  \\n\\nRegardless, I would go back in a heartbeat.\\nBon appetit!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Very over-priced, especially for VIP (which we purchased) or immediate access.  Line moved quickly for VIP, I would STRONGLY suggest dishing out the extra $10/person.\\n\\nSent through in large groups (we happened to be with a bunch of freshman/sophomore high school girls) so if you arent in the front all of the scares will be completed prior to you passing through.\\n\\nMediocre at best, go to Scream Park in a group of two and you will be much better off.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I stayed here last year.  Came as part of a USAir Vacation deal; it was an  okay place, nothing to really wow you.  I was a little disappointed in the quality of the furnishings.  It seems like things were already starting to fall apart and they had just opened or renovated.  Like other properties that are for vacation ownership, this one had the standard accompaniments of a fridge (small, but adequate) and a microwave; so at least you could bring things back to your room and store them for late night munchies.  The bed was not as bad as some beds, but certainly not super comfortable so that you didn't want to get out of it.  \\n\\nIf it was the only place in town, I'd stay here again, but otherwise steer clear.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This is one hotel that will not be on my favorite list. It's definitely a hotel for a very young crowd. When walking to my room I noticed a mattress outside one of the rooms which screamed tacky. The next day when leaving my hotel room to grab lunch downstairs, I noticed a bunch of trays with breakfast food and late night snacks lying on the floor (and it stayed there well into the afternoon). I immediately realized that positive first impressions were not this hotel's number one priority for its customers. I would only recommend this hotel to a 20 something crowd looking for a serious place to party.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: My iPhone 5S' screen was damaged yesterday. I was so worried and upset, however, I came here today and got fixed within 45 mins. It looks like nothing has happened to my phone. Also, the price is super acceptable with the discount provided from Yelp. People who work there are very nice, funny and friendly. If you have any problem with you cellphone, don't be hesitated to come here!!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Let me tell you why I like this place.\\n\\nIt's not the quirkiness of the atmosphere with it's wooden tables and multi-color chairs. It's not the staff, who were friendly even on a Friday morning. It's not the menu, which was a nice mix of breakfast items. It's not even that they give you a tiny chocolate chip cookie with your coffee.\\n\\nAlthough I like all of these things.\\n\\nNo, why this place holds a special point in my heart is this: When I was craving mussels - I mean, murderously murdering men for mussels - and it was stupid early in the morning... they still made me mussels. And they even warmed up some bread to go with it.\\n\\nAnd that is why these guys are the winners. They win. Hands down, the winner.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I haven't even gotten my food(to go) yet, but they gave my order to someone else, then made it with the wrong side, and now I'm hoping I make my flight.  Folks standing to order while a gal stands playing with her phone in fruit of them.  Idiots.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Let me start by saying that they are certified by the Pizza association of Naples, and it definitely shows, the pizza is delicious! I absolutely love their dough. We also have had a couple of their appetizers and dessert and everything was pretty yummy. My only complaint is service is definitely NOT up to par...I will probably return just because I know I'll be craving that pizza! Just as a fair warning, don't expect great service. During our last visit almost everything we wanted to order they had \\\"run out of\\\". I can understand this happening if they were daily specials that change often, but they were all permanent menu items. None of the servers seemed to be too thrilled to be there either.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Drinkwaters has really dropped, will never go back. \\n\\nReally bad Top 40 Music Blaring on Christmas Eve.....we like to Rock it out, but this was cheesy, Top 40 Strip Bar music.  \\n\\nBig 33 Oz Bone-In Rib Eye was very gristly - not marbled, but sinewy - chewy - gross.\\n\\nCoffee was completely watery......horribly weak coffee.\\n\\nWe asked for a dark booth, instead received a table.\\n\\nALL OF THIS CRAP FOR A $400 BILL.....used to come here every Christmas Eve, but never again.   My kids Filets were decent, but not worth the price for the overall bad experience.\\n\\nFind Another Steak Place.......we always have loved Mastros, but this place has really gone downhill............\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Cafe Rio has been a favorite spot of mine for a long while now. I have been to their locations in Utah, Washington, and Nevada. It's a step above Chipotle and they have daily specials that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu. The only downfall with this place is that if you're not careful when you're ordering you can end up dropping around 15 dollars for lunch. The portions are all pretty damn big. My favorite thing to order is the Sweet Pork Tostada! This location is right across from UNLV so it can get VERY BUSY!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I like this place, but when you go from the lobby to either the spa area or into the casino everyone is trying to take pictures, creating this clusterfuck mob of people that are just in your way, kind of annoying, but I get it they have a lot of nice things to look at, I just don't appreciate when people that walk in front of you stop  and get in your way, or clog up walking areas.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Decent beer selection, though not many dark beers. Typical bar food. Bartender demanded cash immediately after I ordered instead of creating a tab for me and said it's too difficult to track tabs. Inconvenient. Buck and Honey's is much, much better.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I've been occasioning this location since I moved to Phoenix back in 2001 and thought (since asked by the CEO) I owed them a quick review. I agree with many others that the place could use a facelift. It is located in a strip mall that needs updating by the property manager (not the fault of OCB though). Other than that the food at this location is better than average in comparison with other buffets around the valley (including other OCB locations). I've only been here for dinner so cannot comment about breakfast or lunch but I have no complaints about dinner other than I think it would be nice if there was a lower price option for seniors (65+). It should be more like half price for seniors because they generally just cannot eat that much and it seems a little steep to charge almost $15 for dinner and a drink. If it were up to me to make a change for the better and allow for a more affordable dining experience for seniors I would set the price for a senior dinner at no higher than $8.99 and it should include the drink (in other words keep it under $10 out the door). I have a friend that goes with my wife and I and he complained about the price the last time we went (just a few days ago). I agree with him and think OCB just really needs to be more \\\"senior-friendly\\\" versus kid/family-friendly and even more so here in the valley where there are more seniors than in most other areas of the country...\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Rude customer service rep who called me back. Hung up on me because I couldn't hear her good (can't help that I'm hard of hearing and that she had a strong accent). She even said \\\"oh my god\\\" angrily at one point. Yes, I heard that! I will never come to your salon and I'm contacting Amazon Local to get my money back. Shame on you for mistreating people.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Bought a 25 yr old townhome as my new residence. Gut job. After removing old appliances and professional painters, garage door did not work. Looked at Yelp for help. Was pleased with what I read about Dreikosen: but the actual experience was even better than the reviews!! On time (actually early) and he really knew his stuff. No upsell, no gloom and doom, and a very fair price.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Have you seen Coyote Ugly? Well its just like that... Crazy drunken bartenders dancing on the bar, pouring shots in to patrons mouths, bikers galore. Love this place. When I go downtown I always end up at this dive. Very reasonable drinks and a one of a kind staff I always suggest this place. If you offend easily this is not the place for you. They also have a photo booth which is always a crowd pleaser.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Charging customers for decaf coffee or requesting to have same type of ice cream on your Profiteroles is a bad practice to keep faithful clientele.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: There was only one waiter on staff the night we went, so needless to say service was pretty slow. But after reading the reviews here about the mushroom appetizer and gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce, I had to try the two. I must say they were absolutely delicious! The gnocchi just melted in my mouth! The sauce was so creamy and tasty! YUM! And the mushroom appetizer was on the money! I only give 3 stars because of the service and I tried my buddy's seafood linguine which was just OK. But he went back during lunch and said it was excellent. I will definitely go back to try more.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: MAGGOTS!!!! I wish I could leave a -5 rating on here for Chen & Wok; we have eaten takeout for here for years and always enjoyed it for our greasy Chinese fix. But last night we found fu\\u00a2king MAGGOT in our broccoli. We took it back, got our money and raised a huge stink...other diners also came up to get their money back. That is by far the MOST disgusting experience I've ever had from eating out and I worked in food service for years so I've seen some pretty nasty things. NEVER EVER EAT HERE!!!! I will be calling the health department on Monday. I couldn't believe the girl said, \\\"Well it was probably just something from the vegetables but I'll give you your money back anyway.\\\" Seriously?! It's a fu\\u00a2king MAGGOT!!!! So for anyone considering enjoying good ole Chen & Wok, let me say it again....MAGGOTS!!!!!!!!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Nous sommes ici pour le brunch du dimanche et nous avons command\\u00e9 trois plats diff\\u00e9rents.

I have sampled several different pizzerias over the last year and Mama Depalma's is the best.  Pizza was classic NY style, good thin crust, good tasting sauce, quality cheese, baked perfectly and delivered within an hour.  I can't wait until my next order.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: There was a very bad odor entering bar. It smelled like mold or something to that effect and that was the first problem. They also claim to have a new menu, but what they really need to do is get a new cook. They have one person back there trying to handle orders for the whole bar which wasn't that crowded for Monday football. It is the same cook that has always been there and he just doesn't know how to cook. This is an asian owned sports bar, but they only have one asian dish - why not add a few more and see what works. The beer prices are very low still ($2.25) for a bottle or draft, so that is the saving grace and the TV's are large and plentiful, but they need to freshen up that smell before I will return.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Good food and service nice location,a little put off by not being able to mix couple of pancakes without being charged seperatley for each one.

There are many Chinese joints closer to us, but we always take the extra time to drive to Golden Harvest.\\n\\nMy litmus test is Kung Pao Chicken. GH uses good quality chicken in an oh-so-tasty sauce that I mop up with rice when the chicken's gone. I'm not a big fan of orange chicken (it's usually a gloppy mess of gristly meat), but GH again uses good meat and fries it to a perfect crispiness that stands up to the sweet sauce. My wife, a tofu lover, is addicted to their deep-fried pillow tofu (seriously, try it). In over 10 visits, every single dish we've tried has been a winner.\\n\\nGolden Harvest is the gold standard for American Chinese in the southeast valley.

We got our drinks served by a cranky but efficient bartender and we made our way down to the stage just as a dancer came on. I have never seen burlesque live, only having seen it on tv with Dita von Teese, but seeing it live is a whole different experience. The woman who performed was a phenomenal dancer and I didn't know people could bend the way she did. I liked how she played with the crowd and it was fun to watch both for women and men. The second dancer was also fabulous, opening with her leg lifted and her foot resting on top of the doorway so she was in a standing splits. Wow.

I could not even eat it!! Literally half the salad plate was dressing, it was like salad tossed in soup. Ask for the dressing on the side!!! I'm warning you!! The steak was cooked properly, the way I wanted it. Shrimp was nothing special and the mashed potatoes tasted like real potatoes.

If you really like pizza, try Oregano's, Grimaldi's or Pizzeria Bianco.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Stayed at the El Cortez from 3/19-3/23 for March Madness.  This will unfortunately most likely be the last of 4 consecutive years spent at this location with all of my out of town friends.  The price is certainly right, $330 for 4 nights...it has steadily increased each year without much additional service.  I stayed in the \\\"Pavilion Rooms\\\" this year.  They are located directly above the garage and have direct access to an outdoor walkway.  This meant a lot of blaring music from Fremont each night until 1-2am.  The room also smelt of marijuana all day every day.  \\n\\nThe main reason that the stay was disappointing was the March Madness \\\"Fiesta Room\\\" viewing party the hotel held.  I had specifically reached out to the El Cortez via Facebook prior to booking the stay to ensure they would be having their AMAZING $1 beers and dogs at the party.  They assured me that they would so I went ahead and booked the room.  We found out that this was not the case upon checking in, they had tripled the beer cost and doubled the dog cost.  Still not breaking the bank at $3/$2 but it was more about the incorrect information.  Luckily we were able to return to a previous favorite spot, Benny's Bullpen in Binions ($2.50 20 ounce Miller Lites) to spend our time and money.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Great place to watch games, better than average bar food.  Service is a plus!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I guess this place used to be cool to hang out, but something changed. A friend who was a former ARZ resident took us here on a Saturday night and for the most part, it wasn't that bad. It's a huge place and with a great outdoor patio and bar. Best part, $1 beers from 10pm- Midnight! We stayed here for awhile until the demographics drastically changed to a point where we felt.. hmmm.. maybe we should go. They had a group put a \\\"VIP\\\" banner in the patio for \\\"pictures\\\"... we all thought this was very strange, but you can't beat $1 beers!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I live in Hermosa Beach CA and I am an International Platform Barber!

I could've bought the nachos and salsa at half the price for twice the serving size at the grocery store.  Even the margaritas are not good.  And they served a pint glass. Why?  The tacos look good, but they are flavorless and bland at best.

Down the Forbes Avenue (almost a side street) approach to Market Square from Stanwix, Fat Tommy's is in a surprisingly newer-looking space.  The layout, tables, and bar area are definitely underwhelming.\\n\\nDuring my brief take-out interaction --- on the phone and pickup/pay, I pay very particular attention to whether I think the waitstaff is happy I'm there, or if I'm more of a bother. The service was OK --- not particularly friendly, or helpful.\\n\\nI'm not sure I like their motto, though, \\\"Fresh Food with Attitude\\\" and how that fits in with William Degel's(of Uncle Jack's in NY, or TV)  oft mentioned \\\"Customer is King.\\\" mantra.  Is the food supposed to have attitude or the waitstaff?\\n\\nIn any event, I picked the Supreme Cheese Steak. I don't like 9\\\" hoagies generally, especially with no option for a 12\\\". I think 9\\\" can be too small for a big guy like myself and it might be nice to have another 3\\\" for another $3 bucks, but I digress.\\n\\nIt was a chopped steak and while there was a decent portion of it on there, the mushrooms, green peppers, onions, mayo, and cheese were harder to find. The bread was pretty fresh. The overall sandwich lacked seasoning and lacked that punch that says, \\\"Damn that's good.\\\"\\n\\nIt wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either.  I don't see myself craving another one any time soon.\\n\\nTheir credit card machine was down, and so they were copying credit card numbers & expiration dates to run later.  While I'm not overly paranoid, in the current state of the world with regards to identity theft, I'm not thrilled with this process.\\n\\nMiddle of the road service and middle of the road food begets middle of the road rating.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I like this place because my wife takes the her car there and they have never tried to offer unnesscary repairs .

We went there three of us here late on a Friday night for our pre-party grub. \\n\\nOur waiter, which I'm glad I had forgotten his name already, had the worst attitude. We asked him to suggest items on the menu and he was pressuring to order items he suggested standing over the table, and wouldn't leave until we asked for a couple of minutes. \\n\\nThe kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life. \\n\\nThe food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas. \\n\\nMost overrated, perhaps the only redeeming factor to this place, which got us in there in the first place is its decorative interior, but don't be fooled, it's got nothing to live up to it.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Someone recommended Beauty's as the place to go for breakfast in Montreal. It was close to where we were staying, so why not. It was a weekday morning, so no crowds, but sufficiently populated. The service was fast and pleasant enough, but I don't understand the hype about the food. My husband had the challah French toast , whichwas tasty. I had a mushroom omelet that tasted fine, but nothing special. I had no choice of bagel, and the default is sesame.  It was probably the most bland tasting bagel I had ever eaten aside from supermarket bagels. Another thing, if you're a tea drinker, get your tea elsewhere either before or after your meal. The tea is horrible. That was just about it for me. Next time I'll go to one of the many other restaurants on Avenue Mont-Royal.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This time a star was lost--by partly burned Bruschetta with fresh diced tomato.  Being told by our server that charring the Bruschetta somewhat was intentional in order to make the dish authentic was unconvincing and not at all believable--especially since I have not encountered blackened or partly burned Bruschetta anywhere else before or since.  \\n\\nA cool Chopped Caesar Salad with tasty and crunchy homemade croutons, on the other hand, was very good.  And, a hot bowl of Minestrone Soup was a superior rendition of this Italian mainstay, with carrots, spinach, carrots, tomato, peas, celery, onions, and Cavitappi in a tomato-based broth.  Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and great in texture and taste.  But, although Veal Piemonte featured well-pounded veal, it was warm rather than hot, and had a slightly stringy consistency to it..  Service was very good, but bread plates were inexplicably removed early from the table.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We come here all the time because its close to home and there's somthing on the menu for everyone - healthminded or not, kids or adults - and it offers outdoor seating and a decent wine list. The servers have been there for years and are very warm toward us. Overall, its a solid choice for the family.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Frank's gets 5 stars, GREAT sandwiches, friendly service and great prices.

I would give it 6 stars if they let me.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Ordered a fish sandwich, the kid looked up at the menu and said \\\"huh?\\\". I said \\\"...A jumbo fish and cheese\\\". Silence, awkward stare. He looked up at the menu again, then took my partner's order.\\n\\nBehind the counter, I noticed him chattering a bit with his co-workers, again looking up at the menu. After a few minutes, he returned to my table and said to me \\\"I'm sorry... what did you say you wanted?\\\" \\\"A fish sandwich\\\", I replied. \\\"Oh, it's just that no one really ever orders those...\\\" Great, I was sure this sandwich is going to turn out awesome.\\n\\nAbout ten minutes later, our sandwiches arrived. All fine and dandy, except my friend did not order a sandwich. She ordered garbage fries or some facsimile thereof. He apologized for the mistake, looked understandably embarassed and returned with her correct order a few minutes later.\\n\\nNow these garbage fries... they were a sight to be hold. More like fry soup. The paper boat was literally sopping with liquid, and I'm surprised it didn't capsize in its own goop. The cheese was more like campbells cheese soup from a can, completely liquid, and drowning the doomed french fries. Not only could this cheese/fry mixture have easily been mistaken for a college culinary experiment gone horribly wrong, it was also bland as hell. Some things are ugly but taste great, and this was not one of them. Equally disappointing was the fact that the \\\"bacon\\\" was in fact \\\"bacon bits\\\", fake and salty little pink crumbs of preservatives.\\n\\nAfter expressing distaste for our experience to a different waitress, and pointing at our uneaten fry/soup-boat, we were only met with \\\"Oh, whats wrong with it?\\\", and not a single mention of a refund.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I've been here before and ordered more \\\"commonplace\\\" items I guess, and they've been stellar. We just had one rotten experience, maybe yours will be better.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Typical Denny's, decent food, slow service. This one has a really nice meeting room. I came as a guest of one of the Toastmasters clubs that meets here. \\n\\nLinda, our waitress, would do much better in tips if she wasn't so surly and maybe tried to smile. We were the only patrons at that time, yet it was like pulling crocodile teeth to get coffee in the first place and refills thereafter. When I asked for a menu, she shouted from across the room, \\\"There's a whole bunch of them right here,\\\" then gave me a look like I was an imbecile for not knowing that the waitress couldn't lower herself to bring menus to the customers' tables. Silly me, I just assumed, given that's how it's been done at every Denny's I've been to since...well...ever. She made me feel like an unwelcome burden. \\n\\nHere's a tip, lady: Ya got one job. As a customer, I'm it. If you can't bother to take care of me and even pretend to be friendly, find another line of work. Maybe something that requires deep sea diving or solitary confinement.\\n\\nPS, the bathroom was an unmitigated pig sty. Neither the paper towel nor soap dispenser worked. It smelled like dirty diapers.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Every year, since 2011, we've come to Vegas for SEMA and every year, we stay at this HIE. Our first year, we were very impressed with the quality of our suites, the cleanliness of the hotel overall, the dinner served on T/W/Th, and freshly baked cookies every evening from 7-9. The week of SEMA is a crazy one for us so having a quiet, comfy place to sleep is of utmost importance and this HIE exceeded our expectations. I've seriously never been to a hotel this quiet! It's very conveniently located and only a 10-15 minute trip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and any of the other places we like to go while staying in Vegas. Staff is friendly and the coffee and cinnamon rolls are delicious. \\nDrawbacks: They only play Fox News in the food area. Not sure if this is the franchisee's preference or the employee's choice but it'd be nice to have some other news programs playing while I'm trying to enjoy my coffee. Also, I'm not sure if there's been a change in management or ownership but our room wasn't quite as clean as in years past, the carpeting is pretty stained, the elevator is getting louder every year and housekeeping services seemed a bit sloppy this time. \\nNone of these things will keep us from staying here next year. We have a loyalty to HIE and hope this hotel continues to exceed our expectations. :)\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Older hotel, but clean and cheap for a night when you don't want to drive home. Good service overall.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We switched to this day care about 4 months ago with our two boys. My first impression was how colorful and cheerful the facility looks from the outside. I like that there are multiple entrys/exits for the parking lot.  The building is well lit and I really like that the front door is locked with a keypad entry.\\n\\nOnce inside it is decorated in all the different kids' art. There is a great big room, about the length of the building, that all the kids are in in the morning and evenings with a tv, lots of toys and a gaming console. As all the children and teachers arrive they sort out into age appropriate classrooms. In the classrooms each child has a cubbie, a sleeping mat, a hook and classwork folder the can use. Breakfast, snacks and lunch are all provided. I do have one picky eater and they are great about giving him his own lunch. My other son had a dietary restriction and they were great about working with that as well! And they also offer potty training assistance.\\n\\nThere are also 3-4 seperated playground areas with loys of toys. During summer there is a weekly water day with a huge inflated bouncy water slide that gets professionally set up for all the kids to go on no extra fees!  Also if your interested in extracurricular activities like gymnastics on Fridays the Tumble Bus comes and for a seperate fee you can sign your kids up to tumble. I like that the gym comes to the school.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons we decided to switch to this school was due to their use of the Saxon Curriculum. I've seen huge jumps in cognitive learning with both my 2 yr old and 4 yr old!  Also the prices here are very competitive to other daycares in the area and we've switched several parents on to this place. We love the atmosphere  of the place, the owner is very involved. She's very friendly and you can tell she loves the kids. The teachers are kind and patient and really do care. I really can not say enough good things about Kids Garden Academy my husband and I love this place!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The food is not fit for my dogs...I will not be ordering food from this place...everything else is good.

I will stick with the Beer at Tailgaters.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: If it was just about the food, I'd give 808 three stars. But dining out is much more than just food, it's also service and ambiance. To be fair, I've eaten here three times. I didn't review it before because I had pretty much stuck to the happy hour menu (which is quite extensive). Until I'd tried the regular menu, I resisted the urge to Yelp despite my sub par experiences.\\n\\nThe menu looks great. It has a good variety of sushi and seafood dishes as well as things to please regular carnivores. But in reality, the food is just OK, and for the price I expected a lot better.\\n\\nFood issues: \\nI've tried a few of the chicken tapas and have found them all quite bland. Many of the seafood dishes and sushi come with either citrus sauces or their house ponzu, both of which are far too acidic and burned my mouth. I had the salmon trio which came with a miso sauce that was sickly sweet. This place is also very heavy on the raw onion in many dishes, which I'm not a fan of. I didn't enjoy any of it. The highlight was the nigiri, that's hard to mess up.\\n\\nService:\\nEach and every time I've visited, the place has been almost empty. Yet, there are numerous staff on shift that seem incapable of providing any service at all. The servers have no clue about the menu and I ended getting something that I had a food sensitivity to, despite letting the server know I was trying to avoid it. The server was completely inattentive and spent most of her time gossiping with her coworkers. I had to order at the sushi bar because she never came around to check on me after my initial order, or take any of the plates I'd finished with. I also never got my check, I had to go and pay at the front. Bad service is a deal killer for me, especially when the food is nothing special. \\n\\nLastly, 4 bucks for green tea? Extortion. Most places give that for free. I won't be back and I can't see this place lasting long, especially since there's better places just up the road. If you've bought a Groupon, best use it soon.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "index": "18", "compressed_output": {"compressed_prompt": "love cute hip breakfast places snooze working bring cute hip breakfast spot not. \\ nCool decor patio open - air bar seating selection mimosas bloody Mary ' s $ 6 - 8 each ) nFood looked good didn order. location old Town country mall wish closer to central nStaff friendly still working out kinks. wait for two mimosas beer. giving Snooze benefit back to sample menu. make five star status CA / CO chain.

Go try somewhere else for steak.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I liked this buffet ....mostly. Some of the standouts were ribeye steak, Oysters, Crab & the super amazing infused honey.\\nA few things that need to be better...the shrimp had an off texture & flavor about it, almost like it had been soaked in a watery chemical to make it look bigger, prime rib was just meh, no real chocolate souffle here. Warmed Chocolate Fondant Cake is not Chocolate Souffle for those of you that do not know. They had a banana flavored souffle which was terrible. Please don't tease me and say your going to have Chocolate Souffle and then try to offer me banana as if that will cover my chocolate souffle craving. This could be a huge item that would draw a lot more people in for you guys if you did it right. Easy solution - get rid of the fondant cake and make sure you have chocolate souffle everyday instead. Maybe rotate in some other flavors in addition to the chocolate like grand marnier. \\nOh yeah the lasagna was a bit on the dry side due to overcooking or being under the heater. \\nI'm going to check back with them in a few weeks to see if they have made any new changes.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I'm all for supporting local businesses. This mom-n-pop taqueria-esque shop is located in the Walmart plaza off of Rainbow and Spring Mountain. It's small and unassuming both inside and out. The lady at the counter (the owner perhaps?) was very friendly and happy to talk about everything on the menu while I stared at it.\\n\\nShe sold me on the al pastor burrito ($5.50). I love pork and this place is called \\\"The Famous Burritos\\\" so I figured it had to be good. Two minutes after ordering the food was ready. Surprisingly quick? yes. It takes me longer to make toast in the morning. I couldn't see back in the kitchen where it was made, but I don't think the al pastor comes off a spit a la Tacos el Gordo. More likely it's sitting in a tray like Chipotle waiting to be served.\\n\\nWhile it wasn't a massive burrito, it was large enough -- filled with plenty of rice, onions, cilantro and beans. The pork lived up to its billing, providing plenty of heat with an array of spices. Not quite on the level of Tacos el Gordo's pastor, but still a-ok. The burrito also came with a small bag of tortilla chips. Not a bad option if you're in the area and want some cheap eats.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I have been to a few other revolving sushi bars and I will have to say this place has a lot to learn about doing business. It took about 15 mins just to get our drink order (water) and the place wasn't to busy. The selection of food on the belt was very slim and looked as if it been sitting fir a while. I was a little unhappy after I found out it was cheaper to purchase the gyoza from the menu then (6pcs for 2.00, instead of 3 pcs for the grand opening every plate 2.00 off the belt).   I tried the mango shrimp roll and the mango wasn't even ripe.  We had a lot of uneaten food as the taste and quality was poor. I know for sure I will not be returning to this place.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: My insurance company listed Airpark Collision Center as a repair option and I'm so glad I called.

I was like.... nah.......won't come here again. We came here for lunch. There were like only 7 tables and there were 3 sushi chefs but the service was extremely slow. Guess what? We only had 2 rounds of sushi in 11/2 hours! You're prolly wondering if we ordered like tons of sushi...nope not even close to  20 pcs each round. Not to mentioned that the quality went straight down.... we didn't even bother to get the third round... The bill came and guess what? They charged us 18% tips for 2 people!!  No apology and what so ever... The server said they got the wrong check for the wrong table... so does that mean that they were charging other tables 18% tip? Whatever reason it is, guys pay attention to the bill.. it's no joke!

Thankfully, they got rid of the plasma tv that played dance music...  Totally inappropriate for the demographic that visit.\\nThat said, their cappuccino is the best in Corstorphine, and much much better than you'd get in many other places.\\nIt's a shame that Wetherspoons along the road are selling their coffee at almost half the price.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Food is tasty, they have a good beer selection and the atmosphere is cool. BUT I think the food is overpriced. I know it's Vegas, but still.\\n\\nA great tip...if you can chug beer like a pro go for the 7 second beer challenge. Choose a beer ($10 or less) and if you can finish it in 7 second or less it's free. You can do this twice daily.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: we tried this restaurant on Valentine's Day, and I really regret coming here.  First of all, we keep getting coupons for this place from the circulars, and decided to go ahead and try it since we both love Italian food.  When we walked in, there was a sign that said \\\"Seat Yourself\\\" so we did.  The place wasn't very busy.. with about 1/3 of the 15 or so tables available.  It took around 10 minutes for a waitress to come by, and without even saying hello or introducing herself, she asked what we wanted to order.  I was a waitress for years, and thought it was very strange that she didn't even ask for our drink order.  We said we'd have some wine, and a couple waters first, then order.  Well that was a big mistake because it took her nearly 20 minutes to come back.  At this point, I was still pretty forgiving, since I figured another server must have called out sick or something, or this lady was pissed that she had to work on Valentine's Day.  When she finally returned, she didn't apologize, or explain what took so long.  We both ordered a ravioli dish that was okay, and very small, it was almost like a kid's dish.  We're not big eaters, and even still the food portion was tiny.  I would rate the food 6 out of 10.  I would NOT recommend this place if you value good customer service.  Go to Bamboo Grille next door, much better food, and great customer service.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Best all you can eat sushi place I've ever been to! No limit on the specialty rolls or sashimi! Great Sake selection as well. Though, my favorite part has to be the waitresses, they are lively, funny, and great at their jobs! I am definitely coming back.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Shawizzz......zzzz.....zzzz\\n\\nWhat my expectations of this cute little wine restaurant sounded. At first glance I was excited since Saturday nights are my nights to go Yelping! My Wine Cellar is the first stop. My guest and I sat at the bar.  We ordered a few drinks.... we ordered a few drinks....I said we ORDERED A FEW DRINKS!  Oh there you are! For a minute there I was getting thirsty. Granted big party was \\\"in da house\\\" out back rockin' away, but really I'm sitting at the bar. I can reach over to pour my own drink if that is fine.  \\n\\nWe ordered some roasted Brussel Sprouts, Classic Pizza, Fries, and Hummus.  Brussel Sprouts were good, Fries were greasy, Classic Pizza -- well was classic and the Hummus was good minus the rock bread we ate it with.\\n\\nOnly thing I dig so far about this place is the ambience.  I love the outdoor patio overlooking the green grass and the band gave it a Jazzy feel.  I think they should invest in more couches, but that's just my opinion. - Enjoy!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I'm writing a review for the bar more so than the pizzeria.

Probably no longer in business....  It is now 10:12 pm.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Okay, I have some explaining to do. My best friend and I are going to an EVENT this weekend to celebrate her birthday. She came up with the awesome idea of getting all crazy and wearing wigs. .....I thought \\\"FUN\\\" and wholeheartedly  agreed !!! ........Now she wants me to keep this wig thing a secret so strictly poker face here. \\n\\nAfter reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cool wigs. I drove us around the block three times, literally . With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave , it's not exactly easy to access. \\n\\nFinally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says \\\"Wigs\\\" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.\\n\\nWe walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. \\n\\nI was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said \\\" Are you going to buy a wig today\\\"? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!\\n\\nAlthough the parking was atrocious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfect wigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!! (that's worth five stars in of itself!) Overall, I would rate this shopping experience a  solid five ! \\n\\nHave a great weekend ! \\n\\nGaga..........Oh-la-la\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: OK...I like to eat. \\nI eat a lot. \\nI like to eat good food. \\nSo far, I haven't experienced that here. \\n\\nSure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. \\n\\nI wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. \\n\\nDoes that make sense? \\n\\nHow is that even possible?\\n\\nThey give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?\\n\\nWell....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. \\n\\nMy precious....\\n\\nI also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips. \\n\\nYeah, I gave it another chance and it's time for me to move one.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This is a more than decent place downtown to grab a bite that I happened upon. I had a ham and cheese omelet here prior to a job interview last week, and it was quite good. Their menu leans heavily towards Greek, Arabic, and vegetarian fare. Recommended.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: A bit pricey. Portions are rather small but the food is good. The decor is beautiful. The ahi tuna is my favorite. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to have a cocktail here. :-(\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Hard to ruin breakfast, but they managed. Dry burnt eggs and tasteless food. May have been convenient but would not recommend it.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: A little yoga gem right in the heart of college town. I've done yoga at a number of places & I'm used to expecting to \\\"get what you pay for\\\" so my expectations for my first donation based class weren't exactly high, but this place left me pleasantly surprised. It's perfectly clean, the ambiance is serene (esp during evening candlelit class), the staff is very personable, & of course, the yoga is awesome. I know it's a good class when my glasses fog up, which was achieved in every class I've taken with Cindy & James. I've brought friends with me with all different yoga experience (even first timers) & they all loved it too. It's definitely a place worth trying & spreading the word about.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Great atmosphere. Great coffee. Horribly boring and bland food.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We celebrated at the restaurant for my birthday.  The food our party ordered was absolutely delicious.  Granted, I was a tad bit wasted by then.. But I remember thinking how great everything tasted.  I ordered the lobster kimchi fried rice, others ordered the sea bass, filet mignon noodles, and I forgot the rest.  In any case, I tasted all the dishes and have nothing negative to say.  At the end, the waiter brought me a giant fortune cookie which was scrumptious!  We had made reservations, but ended up waiting way too long.  Besides the wait, I highly recommend Tao.  Great Asian food and awesome ambiance.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Come with a group of friends and you'll have a good time. The interior design is pretty cool.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: First, service was great but the cheeseburgers weren't good. It's a shame because I can throw together a decent burger at home with some fresh ground beef and fresh buns. It's not rocket science! Not sure why these local places can't put a tiny more effort into their food to get repeat costumers. \\nAlso, don't sit near the kitchen because they have a noisy machine (ice, maybe?) and it's impossible to have a conversation.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I tried this place for the first time today, and loved it! It's a revolving sushi bar with a conveyer belt running different types food, dessert, and beverages around the restaurant. The most expensive plate is $2.00, and the cheapest is $1.00. Each plate of sushi is about 3 to 6 pieces depending on how big they are. It's a great way to be brave and explore different types of sushi w/out breaking the bank. The fun & casual atmosphere is sure to enhance your dining experience!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I went to the pub on a Thursday late afternoon. It wasn't busy, just a few other people. I tried their St Henri brew, which was decent. What I didn't like was that the service sucked big time. The bar maid came and took my order as soon as I sat down. She asked if I was eating, I let her know that I wasn't sure. She dropped off my drink and left. I couldn't seem to get her attention for any follow up service. You see I decided that I was hungry. For 20 minutes after I finished my beer I just couldn't seem to get any service at all. She just kept talking to other staff behind the bar.\\nI left and had a sandwich at Toi et Moi instead.\\nNow I thought that this might be an aberation. But my new next door neighbour was moving in today. He said that after he closed on his condo yesterday, he went over for a drink. He found that the bartender acted as if she was doing him a favour in serving him. \\nSo that is two experiances in two days. I don't know about my neighbour. But I have crossed them off my list of places to go or to recommend. In fact I would go so far as to tell people to run the other way if they are invited there.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: One word... CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA!\\n\\nOk...it's one word if you say it like I do. I like to say it fast so I can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part.\\n\\nThis place is awesome. I ordered samosas, garlic naan, mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *giggle*. The mixed grill was good, but the naan and the masala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by 'slap' I mean I may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful. \\n\\nDISCLAIMER: *No hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before, during, or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from I.D.P. The improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional...the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: My bf wanted to have sushi tonight and my task was to chose a sushi joint near home.  After I yelped, Sushi Imagine was the highest rated and closest in proximity.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, we were immediately welcomed by all servers and chefs.  They are super friendly.  \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\n-Bento Box #3: includes tempura (light and crispy), sashimi (doesn't taste so fresh and the tuna does not taste like sashimi grade), rice, chicken kare-age (very tasty), small salad and miso soup. \\n\\n-Spider Roll: very beautifully plated.  Too bad it doesn't taste as great as it looks.\\n\\n-Spicy tuna roll topped with a white fish: never again will we order this.  The spicy tuna over powers all the other flavors, assuming that there are other flavors.\\n\\n-Order of hamachi sushi:  Not the best piece of fish...\\n\\nBefore you leave, your table gets one spin on the wheel of paper money so that you can redeem on the next visit.  My bf spinned the wheel and we got $2 worth of paper money.\\n\\nAlmost forgot, from 5pm - 6pm, you get a dollar off an entree, buy a large beer and you get a free small sake.  They also have a daily lunch menu of $5/lunch special.  I may come back for the lunch special since grilled mackerel over rice and chicken kara-age sounds like a steal.\\n\\nOverall, food wasn't delicious as I have hoped, but the service was awesome.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Hm...this is probably my last time staying here. And let me tell you why...\\n\\nI got a discounted room price for $27/night, and I decided to beat the July 4th crowd and booked a room from Monday to Weds (7/3).\\n\\nRoom:\\nThey gave us a pyramid room 15013, on the 15th floor (via Elevator #2). Decent view of TheHotel and Mandalay Bay Resort, but that's pretty much it. The A/C was like a motel style one where you would have to go through trial & error to find the \\\"right\\\" tempt for the room.  There's no digital reading or measurement, but a dial for fan control (low to high) and tempt (Warm to Cool).  There is a flat screen tv in the room, but the channels all had bad receptions. Bathroom was OK, with a shower and a sink with all the complimentary toiletries.  Beds were comfortable, but I swear the room has fleas.  I had a bug bite on my arm when I woke the next morning, so that was something I was not expecting. And my mom got bitten too, when she sat in one of the room chairs... UGH... LUXOR, if you're reading this, considering FUMIGATING YOUR ROOMS!\\n\\nElevator:\\nDidn't know the Luxor was an amusement park, too. LOL!  All of the Pyramid Elevators all rattled and roared from one floor to the next.  Hm...if you didn't know any better, you'd expect a sudden drop and free fall when you hit the top floor....luckily that didn't happened.\\n\\nFinal Verdict:\\nI have no problem splurging a bit more to stay at a 4 or 5 star resort after this 3 day hotel horror show.  No wonder it was $27/night...they literally exchanged it for blood, and a souvenir of bites to take home.  No.THANKS.LUXOR!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: California Club... That is all.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: My first experience ever eating at Outback Steakhouse wasn't all that great. I was really excited for this location to open. So the wait wasn't all that bad considering they were busy. I think we waited 15-20 min at the most. The server was at our table fast. We ordered the seared ahi which was delicious. My husband ordered the steak salad and I ordered ahi sesame salad. The food was finally here. My husband's salad was missing the steak. How bad of a cook do you have to be to forget the steak on the steakhouse salad????? My salad had the ahi and the lettuce. Nothing else!!! The 5 other ingredients it came with were missing. Red peppers, cilantro, sesame seeds, almonds and sesame vinaigrette. We sat there waiting for out waiter to show up. I even looked up the menu to make sure I wasn't going crazy and my salad was missing all that. He showed up and we showed him the salads. He said I'll be right back. Came back with what looked like a fourth of a steak cut up. Looked like someone was in a hurry and that's all they had so they slap it on the plate. All my stuff was still missing. And his reply was \\\" we don't have the brightest people working in the kitchen\\\". Really? Nice of you to talk like that about your coworkers. So after we gathered all the ingredients for our salads they weren't really bad but nothing I would go back for. I know they opened not too long ago but come on get your stuff together. I'd rather eat at miller's ale house across the street.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This has become our Saturday morning, post Weight  Watchers meeting, breakfast hangout.

If not, then find other places to spend $25 bucks per person (entry $15, free fruity shot, and a $10 weak drink).

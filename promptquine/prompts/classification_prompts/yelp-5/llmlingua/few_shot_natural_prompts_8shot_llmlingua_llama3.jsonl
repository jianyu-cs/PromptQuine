Just absolute jerks, I can't say it enough.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This branch is a hit or miss when it comes to customer service. There are some cases where the employees have been short with me and then there are some occasions where they bend over backwards. Overall, they are pleasant enough and get me in and out in a timely manner. \\n\\nThey are reasonable with the speed in which they turn people. It is busy for being such a small branch. There is always a line, but the wait is not that long.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I've never been a fan of this place and I'm still now.  My dad enjoys this place and found several things on the menu that he was interested in.  We shared a calamari which was good, and I ordered their korean chicken pizza.  I took 1 bite and didn't like it at all.  To be honest it's not that it was made wrong or anything like that, I just didn't care for it.  The server was nice and took it away and the manager stopped by to inquire and I simply told her I just didn't care for it and it was removed from the check.   Lunch was completely dead in here and it didn't surprise me. \\n\\nI also found it dis respectful (since I'm a restaurant manager myself) to have a server LOUDLY say in the middle of an empty dining room \\\"I can't take that table\\\"\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I decided I would like all my dining to be done at the bar of old renovated homes in downtown Phoenix.

Unfortunately, I will only be reviewing on item.  I'll make it up to you; I promise.\\nWe went during lunch and there was a wait for a table for two, so we sat at the bar.  The place is pretty small.  The bar was big enough for four people, five tops.  There was a nice selection of spirits and wine that I could see but not drink.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and chose the potato salad over the baked beans.  It was deliciously moist and the chiles had the right amount of heat.  The potato salad was very tasty satisfying side.\\nIt was a simple, satisfying lunch.  I would like to come back another time when they aren't as busy.  It was hard to get a server/bartender's attention and there's some cozy seating outside that's too hot to use at lunch in August.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We had lunch here last week and had a great experience.\\nWe ordered the meat pierogi, potato & chz pierogi, and gr. beef cutlet.

The puppies were adorable, and we played with several of them and I chose one. I had not intended on purchasing a puppy that day but I thought, what the heck, we always wanted one.\\nThe prices were really high, and we came back the next day to return and they still said I have to pay 40% for a dog I no longer had? They over load you with paperwork and crap and you do not get to process everything, especially with an adorable puppy in your arms. Not only that, but our dog was REALLY sick in the afternoon the next day. Why would they sell me a sick dog for 3000?\\n\\nOverall a terrible experience, I would not recommend anyone going there. Purchase straight from a breeder for the rarer breeds to avoid the third party costs.\\n\\nAnd not just that, everything is expensive including the \\\"free\\\" starter kit they used.\\n\\nAWFUL\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This place was awesome! Such a fun idea. It was quite busy, but it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted anyway, and it was interesting to watch them making other people's ice cream while we waited. I had the coconut milk chai ice cream with salted caramel... it was just OK, the caramel was too burnt-tasting for my taste. But the mint ice cream (with regular milk) and the banana (with almond milk) were really terrific. I think if they used a fuller fat coconut milk it would make a richer, more satisfying ice cream (and still gluten-free and non-cow).

The instructors were well versed in laying out all the instructions so that our group knew what to do. \\n\\nTIP: Use the Yelp and foursquare promo deals so that you can save on your flight and your DVD of your flight experience (if you choose to get one)\\n\\nThe great thing is that the instructor will guide you and take you through it so that you won't have to feel nervous at all.\\n\\nTrust me, by the end of the day, you're going to feel very sore from all the intense wind tunnel velocity shooting through your body. \\n\\nOverall, I'd recommend that you try it and see how much fun it can be!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The Phoenix airport experience is horrendous. This is my second time this year and likely my last. Understaffed, one person checking in cars at 6:30am, aloof indifferent staff. Awful. I get stressed each time I rent there. I won't put up with it anymore.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Came here for lunch with bottomless champagne for about $30. I was pretty satisfied. This buffet is separated by countries (they actuall have signs that say Asian/Italian/American...etc.). All in all, each type of food is well represented. The chinese food was good, not just your typical Panda Express type. Good pizza. They had Kobe beef sliders!!! Kobe beef! Prime rib was pretty good, tender and pink. Also, the dessert selection is fairly large. The waitress was super nice, loading us up on bubbly as soon as our glasses were empty. Only complaint is that seafood selection could've been better. I would definitely recommend this buffet.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: 1. They don't serve freshly squeezed orange juice. \\n\\n2. They don't serve fresh fruit. (only fruit cocktail out of a  can) \\n\\n3. They don't serve real Jam. \\n\\nIf you serve breakfast, and do not meet at least one  the criteria listed above, then your establishment belongs in the same echelon as Dennys. \\n\\nWhy this place has 4 stars and 630 reviews is beyond me. I question if I even at at the right restaurant? \\n\\nDuring our wait, the host gave us a 5 minute speech on how \\\"the owner buys only the freshest items for the menu\\\". - Fresh like a can of fruit cocktail. \\n\\nThe interior looks like a blue screen studio from Universal Pictures. \\n\\nI had steak and eggs. Steak was gray. Eggs were.... Eggs,  and... Nothing else to report. \\n\\nThey should call this place Mr. Meh... \\n\\nTotally standard stuff here. Not the 5 star type of standard. The 2 star type of standard. \\n\\nNext time ill spare the 45 minute wait and go to Mimi's Cafe, at least they have fresh squeezed OJ, fresh fruit, muffins baked that the same morning, and decent breakfast...\\n\\nSorry to kill the buzz here, but I am sure Mr. Mommy (if he even cares to read yelp) would appreciate some constructive and much needed feedback amongst the hoards of shallow praise. \\n\\nGo get some oranges.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: my friends could not stop raving about the lobster enchiladas from this place while we were in vegas, so we HAD to go. \\n\\nI really liked the chips. I guess they are a blend of flour and corn so they had a different texture than ordinary tortilla chips. Very crisp!\\n\\nunfortunately, i wasnt too impressed by the enchiladas. they didnt exactly blow my mind. i liked the sauce more than the food itself.  However, it was really sweet. I enjoyed it more as a dip for the chips.  \\n\\nThe service was great. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. \\n\\nmaybe i just wasnt in the mood, so the food seemed mediocre.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I decided to try this place after reading they reviews. One of the best manicures I've ever had! Jen was so thorough and meticulous- my feet feel so pampered and soft! And the salon is beautiful. Definitely A five star place!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: My appointment was for glasses.  I give this place one star because the doctor who performed the exam (a young female) was very knowledgeable and thorough.  The rest of my experience of buying the glasses was completely downhill and I would give no star for what I went through.\\n\\nTheir frames selection is very limited in terms of economic pricing.  Most of the frames were name brand super expensive.  As a student, I could care less about the brand and more about saving money.  I looked at a bunch of different frames, from the cheaper ones to brand names.  The lady helping me pick out frames seemed to keep pushing the Kate Spades ones on me and saying how much better they looked on me than all of the other ones.  So I ended up getting them even though they were $100 more expensive than the no-brand ones that I also liked.  \\n\\nIn terms of the lenses, I expressed to her that I wanted to wear these glasses for a long time because the frames were so expensive and because I have a strong prescription, I was willing to pay more for thin, light lenses.  She charged me an extra $50 for that.  After I received my glasses, I didn't feel like they were any thinner than my previous pair and took them to another store.  After just looking at them, the guy at the store told me that there were thinner and lighter options.  I felt completely lied to and robbed.\\n\\nFinally, to rub salt into the wound, when I received my glasses, they lady did not spend any time adjusting then on my face.  Pretty much handed them to me and told me to come back if I needed adjustments.  It turns out that they were way too tight on me and gave me a headache and left marks on the sides of my face.  So I go back to get it adjusted.  My frames were blue-colored metal and I saw her take pliers and yank at them.  After I left, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal!  I could not believe that they would treat my brand new name brand glasses like that.  The glasses still didn't fit right but I was too afraid to go back again.  I went to another store and they adjusted my glasses by warming them up.  Did Illini Eye not have the capabilities to do that??\\n\\nI felt like they just wanted my money and after I paid, they completely ignored me and my needs.  Overall, I feel like I overpaid for these name brand glasses with lenses that are still too heavy and thick.  I've been wearing the glasses for 7 months now and they are uncomfortable and heavy on my face.  This experience has been so horrendous and I hate my glasses so much that I am seriously considering lasik surgery so that I never have to wear glasses again or have to deal with the hassle of getting cheated on a pair of glasses in the future.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I've heard that this is one of the most amazing Thai restaurants to ever exist, but I don't think I'm enough of a Thai connoisseur to support that claim. The food was very good, but I didn't walk out of there feeling blown away.\\n\\nWe shared a rice dish (nam kao tod) which I loved. Have not had anything like that before. A little tangy, little spicy. Maybe it was my own fault for ordering musman curry (too pedestrian?) but I've had better. It was good, but too sweet. My fianc\\u00e9 ordered a noodle dish which was too spicy for me so I can't really rate that.\\n\\nI don't think I would personally go out of my way to go to LOS, but I would go if someone else wanted to.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I was disappointed in the show because about 15 minutes into the show, I realized I was not watching the original members. And what tipped me off was the 6'-2\\\" tall, 220 lb dude in a mask. If you are a die hard fan, you can tell by the movements that they weren't the members you saw on television. The show I watched was pretty much watching the equivalent of a cover band playing your favorite band's music. It was still good, it just wasn't what I thought I was paying for. I did complain to Monte Carlo to try to get my money back and this was their response:\\n\\n\\\"All performers are indeed Jabbawockeez, in every performance. They have expanded their crew and on any given performance, they rotate.\\\"\\n\\nI know some of the dancers are Super Crew members during the b-boy numbers, but you can tell that the routines for the original members were filled in by other dancers. They did do a decent job though, but I still would not buy another ticket to see them perform. I would pay to watch them again if I knew for sure it was going to be the original members. My 2 star rating would be bumped up to 4 stars if that was the case.\\n\\nOther than that, the show is about 2 hours long and more than half of that is filled with comedic mime skits and audience participation numbers. Totally understandable because it would be hard to fill two solid hours of dancing routines. The dance routines were well done. If you have seen all their you-tube videos, you have seen all their dance numbers in the show.\\n\\n2 Stars... JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Mehh...A-OK. I've been here multiple times for the past several years, and I'm not sure why..The pho is alright, don't like the taste as much as some other places I've tried. The service is not good, and the prices are higher than most. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself looks pretty nice and clean, and parking is always convenient. There's never too many people when I go, but the food is just alright..\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: The food is fresh and vibrant. The service is friendly and everything you want from a local breakfast/lunch spot.\\n\\nI had the ultimate club with fries. It was delicious. If you a haven't been you need to come by and try Bite.\\n\\nWe will be back.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The below is just one person's experience and from the looks of the avg diner, it seems like it's a restaurant worth trying.  \\n\\nVegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Le Cirque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobster bisque was way way too salty.  The risotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall off the bone.  The halibut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that was soggy and not what was intended in terms of texture context between the flesh and the breading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of a souffle is to break it yourself and pour in the cream/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking.  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is supposed to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made out of ice, but the taste was too tart and didn't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative. The money would have been better spent else where I'm afraid.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Story of a Wood Fired Chicken\\n\\nOnce upon a warm, sunny March day, two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita. The two monkeys were under the impression that this jungle only offered pita dishes, a notion that was quickly proved to be a myth as each monkey ordered a wrap of sorts. As the two monkeys regretfully chowed down on their mediocre wraps, each caught a glimpse of a most uplifting . . . chicken. Yes, a chicken. A wonderfully massive Wood Fired Chicken, mounted upon a bed of mashed potatoes, floating by to another monkey's tree. Mouths sputtering water, the monkeys finished their meal and agreed to help themselves to this attractive chicken next time.\\n\\nOnce upon another warm, sunny March day, the same two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita and each ordered a fine-looking Wood Fired Chicken. Anticipation knocked on their trees as they waited. Finally, the stunning chicken arrived. The monkeys ravaged each bite of their outstanding meal, which contained a blend of seasoned spinach, mashed potatoes, and juicy chicken - all soaked in a citrusy tomato sauce. Oh glorious day, that day they reveled in the glorious Wood Fired Chicken. Even though the portion was huge, each monkey licked their plate clean and swore they would return again for the Wood Fired Chicken, because that's where it's at in the Jungle of Pita.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Came to this casino since it is attached to the Mandalay Bay. Pretty decent opportunities to gamble with friendly dealers and reasonable table limits. Everything seemed a bit dingy and the random unenthusiastic dancers near the table games was awkward. The free drinks here were really strong and were difficult to drink. One of the few places that actually would refuse drink service to patrons who were not actually gambling (e.g. sitting with someone gambling).\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Its not bad pho, its just not great pho.  When I wrote my first review I was a rookie and didn't have anything to compare it too.  Now that my pho palate has some notches in its belt I can say that this isn't the real deal.\\n\\nMaybe I was here on an off day, but the broth just didn't have that depth and complexity as compared to Ben Thanh or Vietnam Grille.  Thats really about the extent of my review.  The ambiance is nice and I'd say if you are in the area its worth visiting, but other than that, there are other places worth the journey.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I hosted a pre-chemotherapy get together at Saddle Ranch Chop House for a girlfriend of mine that's facing down breast cancer last night and I was NOTHING but impressed with the level of service from everyone, the quality of the food, and professionalism from our server, Teresa.  From the manager that checked in on us last night to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, right down to the employee that took my initial phone call and made the reservation for my event a week ago.  Good work, guys!  \\n\\nSaddle Ranch took care of every detail for us and was very attentive to our needs last night; making sure that our table was set up and decorated with balloons before we arrived, to surprising our whole table (adults only) with a round of pink lemonade vodka shots and two towers of pink cotton candy for our table!  \\n\\nReally I could not be more pleased with them and wanted to thank them personally on Yelp for the excellent service at my friend's very important night out last night.  \\n\\nThank you guys for making my friend's night special!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have given this restaurant FOUR tries and they have failed every time.  Today was the last time I even attempt to patronize their restaurant.  Their food is not that good, and their service is ABYSMAL.\\n\\nWe arrived shortly after they opened for lunch.  There was a single party of five in the restaurant.  While we waited for even a drink order to be taken, the other party was served by all three people working (couldn't spare one for us?), AND another party came in and got their order taken.\\n\\nRepeatedly they walked by us, and ignored us.  We waited 10 minutes then left.  Each of my four experiences there have been like this.  I will never return.  I really hope the owners read this.  They were there today and completely ignored us.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Enjoyed dinner here for the first time since the opening, and YUM. \\n\\nThe restaurant seemed to be pretty crowded, but the host did a fantastic job of traffic control and really had people moving in quickly as tables were vacated. Our server was quick and friendly, and my seasonal draft beer (Penn Brewery Chocolate Stout) was fantastic. \\n\\nPartner and I split the tasty classic poutine, and then each had sandwiches (me: Southwest veggie burger, him: chicken sandwich). Both were good, but not as good as the poutine. \\n\\nMy advice: get here early or late on the weekends, because the place isn't huge (though bigger than its sibling, Point Brugge) and I don't think they take reservations. The waiting area is pretty small (and right in front of the door), which led to some folks waiting in the vestibule. The bar area is sort of cramped and busy, meaning that if you can't grab a barstool, you're likely to be blocking traffic and moving out of the way quite a bit.  \\n\\nTry the poutine and the beers on tap.

I am very, very particular about my pepperoni pizzas. The crust must be thin and crispy. The sauce not too thick or too thin and the pepperoni flavorful. I like my pepperoni pizzas cooked well done. A little black on the crust is totally acceptable and preferred.

Not only is the owner a complete snob, but the equipment is filthy and unsanitary. \\n\\nI was appalled by the snooty attitude of the owner - despite there being no one else in the salon, she acted like she was doing me a favor by \\\"squeezing me in\\\" without an appointment. She talked down to me the entire time and kept glaring at me while I nursed my infant daughter. Not one other person came in the whole time I was there.\\n\\nThe pedicure footbath was obviously filthy when I sat down - with flakes of old skin everywhere and scum. She made a big show of scrubbing the tub before starting, but I should have left then and there because I developed a fungal nail infection within a few weeks of the visit.\\n\\nThe cost was exorbitant for a mediocre pedicure and I've spent nearly as much treating the infection to boot.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Very good beer.

I asked about any other cost of medication and he just told me it would be $10 extra.\\nI got the bill and it was $30 extra, and well I was just prepared to pay about $100.

Good thing I was in Vegas and every night is a party night.\n: great\n\n: Do not think all Port of Subs are alike.  This location is AUL.  We've had bad service more than once.  We't go back after the second time.  The bad service was unbelievable.  They actually argued with my co-worker over what she wanted on her sandwich and got reallyy.  Just absoluteks, I can't say it enough: terrible\n\n: I decided I would like all my dining to be done at the bar of old renovated homes in downtown Phoenix.  Lucky me, I found Coronado Cafe.\\nWe stopped in for lunch so I did not order as much food as I normally like to when trying out a new restaurant ( it was a work day ).  Unfortunately, I will only be reviewing on item.  I'll make it up to you; I promise.\\nWe went during lunch and there was a wait for a table for two, so we sat at the bar.  The place is pretty small.  The bar was big enough for four people, five tops.  There was a nice selection of spirits and wine that I could see but not drink.  I ordered the roasted chicken sandwich and chose the potato salad over the baked beans.  It was deliciously moist and the chiles had the right of heat.  The salad was very tasty satisfying side.\\nIt was a simple, satisfying lunch.  I would like to come back another time when they aren't as busy.  It was hard to get a serverartender's attention and there's some cozy seating outside that's too hot to use at lunch in August.\n: neutral\n\n: We had lunch here last week and had a great experience.\\nWe ordered the meat pierogi, potato & chz pierogi, and gr. beef cutlet. Everything was delicious and tasted authentic. (My husband is from Poland, and I have visited a couple times.) \\nIf you have picky children, they also offer menu items like chicken fingers & FF. \\nThe menu prices were very reasonable.\n: great\n\n: I had a terrible experience here. The puppies were adorable, and we played with several of them and I chose one. I had not intended on purchasing a puppy that day but I thought, what the heck, we always wanted one.\\nThe prices were really high, and we came back the next day to return and they still said I have to pay 40% for a dog I no longer had? They over load you with paperwork and crap and you do not get to process everything, especially with an adorable puppy in your arms. Not only that, but our dog was REALLY sick in the afternoon the day. Why would they sell me a sick dog for 3000?\\n\\nOverall a terrible experience, I would not recommend anyone going there. Purchase straight from aeder for the rarer breeds to avoid the third party costs.\\n\\nAnd not just that, everything is expensive including the \\\"free\\\" starter kit they used.\\n\\nAWFUL\n: terrible\n\n: I lived close to this place....

This buffet is separated by countries (they actuall have signs that say Asian/Italian/American...etc.). All in all, each type of food is well represented. The chinese food was good, not just your typical Panda Express type. Good pizza. They had Kobe beef sliders!!! Kobe beef! Prime rib was pretty good, tender and pink. Also, the dessert selection is fairly large. The waitress was super nice, loading us up only as as our glasses were empty. Only complaint is that seafood selection could've been better. I would definitely recommend this buffet.\n: good\n\n: 1. They don't serve freshly squeezed orange juice.n\\n. They't serve fresh fruit. (only fruit cocktail of a  can) \\n\\n3. They't serve real Jam.n\\nIf you serve breakfast, and do not meet at least one  the criteria listed above, then your establishment belongs in the sameelon as Dennys.n\\nWhy this place has 4 stars and 630 reviews is beyond me. I question if I even at at the right restaurant? \\n\\nDuring our wait, the host gave us a 5 minute speech on how \\\"the owner buys only thehest items for the menu\\\". - Fresh like a can of fruit cocktail.n\\nThe interior looks like a blue screen studio from Universal Pictures.n\\nI had steak and eggs. Steak was gray. Eggs were.... Eggs,  and... Nothing else to report.\\nThey should call this place Mr. Meh...n\\nally standard stuff here. Not the 5 star type of standard. The 2 star type of standard. \\n\\nNext time ill spare the 45 minute wait and go to Mimi's Cafe, at least they have fresh squeezed OJ, fresh fruit,ins baked that the same morning, and decent breakfast...\\n\\nSorry to kill the buzz here, but I am sure Mr. Mommy (if he even cares to read yelp) would appreciate some constructive and much needed feedback amongst the hoards of shallow praise. \\n\\nGo get some oranges.\n: bad\n\n: I decided to try this place after reading they reviews. One of the best manicures I've ever had! Jen was so thorough and meticulous- my feet feel sopered and soft! And the salon is beautiful. Definitely A five star place!\n: great\n\n: Mehh...A-OK. I've been here times for the past several years, and I'm not sure why..The pho is alright,'t like the taste as much as some other places I've tried. The service is not good, and the prices are higher than most. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself looks pretty nice and clean, and parking is always convenient. There's never too many people when I go, but the food is just alright..\n: neutral\n\n: The food is fresh and vibrant. The service is friendly and everything you want from a local breakfastunch spot.\\n\\nI had the ultimate club with fries. It was delicious. If you a't been you to come by and try Biten\\nWe will be back.\n:\n\n: The below is just one person's experience and from the of the avg diner, it seems like it's a restaurant worth trying. n\\nVegas is a place of many many food options, from the casual to the super expensive.  Of course, Leque, is considered high end of the spectrum.  We were not planning to dine there so we were all very very casually dressed, which resulted in us being put in the worst table of the house, by the bar at the front door.  The service was expected for the caliber of restaurant but the food was very much below expectations.  The first course lobsterque was way way too salty.  Theotto was good but not memorable and the salad was a salad, just made to look pretty.  The short ribs were tender but not fall the bone.  Theut was not fresh but frozen, with a wrapping around it that wasgy and not what was intended in of texture context between the flesh and thereading.  The salmon was over cooked and dry, tasted like something a beginner cook would make.  The desserts were okay.  The waiter I remember was quite rude about the souffle.  The best part of ale is to break it yourself and pour in the cream/good stuff but the waiter did that for me without even asking  The conversation with the waiter was douchy at best, felt like talking to cartoon character of what a waiter is to be.  Back to the desserts. The lemon bomb's presentation was cool; it came in a bowl that was made of ice, but the taste was too tart and't have a sweet balance to it.  The third dessert I think was chocolate but I don't remember.  Yes, people, unfortunately, this memories of this restaurant are all negative. The money would have been better spent else where I'm afraid.\n: terrible\n\n: Story of a Wood Fired Chicken\\n\\nOnce a warm, sunny March day, two ravenous monkeys entered the Jungle of Pita. The two monkeys were under the impression that this jungle only offeredita dishes, a notion that was quickly proved be a myth as each monkey ordered a wrap of sorts. As the two monkeys regretfully chowed down on their mediocre wraps, each caught a of a most uplifting.. chicken. Yes, a chicken. A wonderfully massive Wood Fired Chicken, mounted upon a of mashed potatoes, floating by to another monkey's tree. Mouths sputtering water, the monkeys finished their meal and agreed to help themselves to this attractive chicken next time\\nOnce upon another warm, sunny day, the same two monkeys theita and each ordered a fine-looking Chicken. Anticipation knocked on their trees as they waited. Finally, the stunning chicken arrived. The monkeys ravaged each bite of their outstanding meal, which contained a of seasoned spinach, potatoes, and juicy chicken - all soaked in a citrusy tomato sauce. Oh glorious day, that day theyled in the glorious Chicken. Even though the portion was huge, each monkey licked their plate clean and swore they would return again for the Wood Chicken, because that's where it's at in the Jungleita.\n: good\n\n: Came to this casino since it is to theay Bay. Pretty decent opportunities to gamble with friendly dealers and reasonable table limits. Everything seemed a bit dingy and the random unentastic dancers near the table games was awkward. The free drinks here were really strong and were to drink. One of the few places that actually would refuse drink service to patrons who were not actually gambling (e.g. sitting with someone gambling).\n:\n\n: Food was definitely overprice for the two small tacos you receive. Fish tacos were $14 with a small side of beans. I left the place hungry... and what Mexican place't serve chips and salsa before you meal? Also, the food was cold when it reached table.aritas were average at best.\\n\\nWait staff was good, but food runners had no idea who ordered what. I won't be back anytime... how difficult is to mess up Mexican?\n: bad\n\n: A glass of mostly ice, cheaparita mix and a rumor ofquila for $16?   Wow.   Only one bowl of chips?   Wow!   Border Grill, you might to think a little more about giving your customers a little better service and value for the dollar.\n:\n\n: I am back in Phoenix for a little business with a for one of my favorite desert island foods, pepperoni pizza. I am very, very particular about myoni pizzas. The crust must be thin and crispy. The sauce not too thick or too thin and theoni flavorful. I like my pepperoni pizzas cooked well done. A little black the crust is totally acceptable and preferred. Myoni pizza fromregenos inpe was perfection!n\\nMy side of wings was damn good well.\n: great\n\n: Very good beer.  This is a chain brewpub but has high quality food and beer.

For starters, the night we went (about 2 months ago) there was a $12 cover per person and there wasn't even any live music or entertainment. I still don't know what the cover was for... The bar was filthy and totally outdated, the staff were not friendly and the overall vibe was blah. \\n\\nWe arrived and ordered a round of drinks. As we were sitting outside on the patio, one of the bar staff came up to our table to clear our empty drinks and mistakenly took a drink that was half full.

Once we were outside she told us that she thought we were on \\\"high on drugs\\\" (which we weren't) and said we are not welcome back for the night. I called the next day and left a message for the owner and never got a call back to this day. Highly, highly embarrassed and disappointed. \\n\\nWe went back about two weeks ago and decided to give it another shot and we still were not impressed at all. I would absolutely NOT recommend going here. Save your money or go to one of the other 65 bars in the area. That's my story...\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Cheap pizza.  If you're lucky, you'll get what you paid for.  I'm feeling kind and giving this location two stars.  They rarely cover the pizza in cheese and toppings, but remember that the cheese and pepperoni pizzas are just $5.  When we have ordered the supreme ($8) the toppings are either burnt or look as though they have seen a few better days.  If you order the Supreme and they tell you it will be 5 minutes, be prepared to wait anywhere between 15-20.  \\n\\nBottom line, if you're looking for a little more quality, try Papa John's, Domino's or Pizza Hut and pay a few dollars more.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We walked here from the last monorail stop in 112 degree heat because I thought it was going to be that good, it wasn't.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: A+ for service at Karben4.  It was a March madness Saturday, and this was our first stop on a short circuit of Madison breweries.  At about 11:15am, we were their first customers through the door.  The bartender was incredibly friendly and it made a big difference to make us feel welcome in a bar that was just opening for the day.  Even though the place was empty for the first 15 minutes or so that we were there, she was in a good mood and happy to give us some information about the operation without being overbearing.  \\n\\nEvery type of beer they served was solid.  The Deep Winter Stout, Fantasy Factory IPA and Nightcall Porter were all standouts on the flight we ordered.  The feel of the bar area is minimalist, modern, unpretentious, spacious and could double as a Tom Selleck shrine.  We never got around to asking about the artwork.  We also didn't order any food, but I was impressed enough with the place to make it a meal destination the next time I'm in town.  If you're in Madison and you want to check out the local brewing scene, Karben4 should be near the top of your list.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Talk about a woman who knows the meaning of the word boudoir.

The Cozumel Burrito looked very promising, but was pretty \\\"meh\\\" when I got it. It was OK, but the sauce was a little ketchupy. My friend was reasonably satisfied with whatever it was he ordered, but neither of us was blown away.\\n\\nThe biggest gripe I had with this place was the service! We'd just come from a 20 mile bike ride on a hot day, and although I'd been guzzling down and refilling my water constantly, I was perpetually thirsty. I left my water bottle outside on my bike assuming I could get a nice cold glass of water on entering. I literally asked our waiter for water at least 3 times before we got it, including once getting up and walking across the restaurant to the bar. When he finally brought us water, he was not in the least bit apologetic for the delay. Were they busy I'dve been more understanding, but as I said this was post lunch-time rush and there weren't a lot of other tables. This was, however, during the world cup, so maybe the football was decidedly more important than his customers.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Had High Expectations that barely were met. \\n\\nThe word gastropub is becoming dirty in Las Vegas.

Add a bistro steak ordered Medium Rare, SERVED Rare, and at room temperature is also distressing, the only reason I didn't send it back was the flavors from the gastrique and Gorgonzola and my supreme hunger level at that time.\\n\\nMy buddy had mixed views of his Pork Cubano.\\n\\nThere were highs and lows, but right now plans for a return visit.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I'm not a buffet person but when it's complimentary why not?

My favs in the dessert area the peanut butter cookie and Gelato. \\n\\nI did like the idea of the specialty items are in small portions which is a good thing.

It's everything you want in a Mexican restaurant: bottomless fresh chips and salsa before your food comes, enormous portions of delicious Mexican dishes, and a very attentive and polite staff.

Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.\\n\\nSo the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.\\n\\nSo my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.\\n\\nI had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said \\\"Yes, she'll have another!\\\" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??\\n\\nSo to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  \\n\\nNever again.\\n\\nThe two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.

I love that OT is finally a respected reservation system at almost every fine-dining restaurant now. I've been an OT member since 2006 and believe me, it wasn't always this easy. Gone are the days of sifting through their restaurant lists realizing the place you want is not available and you'll have to call only to be placed on hold for an obscene amount of time, and you decide to leave a message only to never receive a call back confirming your request. Yay for self-service technology! Moving on...\\n\\nAs many of you know, Mr. Burke has an obsession with eggs. I didn't see it in the dinner menu, but more so in the d\\u00e9cor. Think obscure paintings and sculptures of Humpty Dumpty-like dudes everywhere. I'm not into eggs, but these were kinda cute, so I didn't mind. What I did mind were the two tops--seating was too close for comfort. We could hear the conversations next to us, which was more of a distraction than we wanted on our special night.\\n\\nAnother thing that irked me was immediately after taking our orders, our waitress declared, \\\"Just so you know, we're REALLY busy tonight, so there will be a longer wait than usual.\\\" \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I had different reactions to the comment: He appreciated the head's up, while I didn't understand why she needed to tell us right then and there. You're a celebrity chef restaurant in a popular Vegas hotel--of course you're busy! I don't care if the kitchen is on fire; always make your guests feel at ease. \\n\\nNevertheless, their Blueberry Thrill martini was surprisingly refreshing and their homemade dinner roll was mouth-watering. The roll comes in individual pans that arrive straight from the oven and on to your plate. For our main courses, I ordered the Seared Salmon and he ordered the Dry-Aged Bone-In New York Strip. Both entrees delivered exactly what we expected--appetizing, generously portioned, and seasoned well. No wow-factor, though. We also ordered the truffle fries, which were amazing. If I can recommend only one thing on their menu, make sure you order the truffle fries!! We were too stuffed for dessert.\\n\\nAnd after all that, there wasn't even a \\\"longer wait than usual\\\" for anything we ordered!  \\n\\nGreat food, so-so service: 3.5, but I'm feeling nice today so I'll round up.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: A friend introduced me to this place a couple of weeks ago.

I have to say we were greatly disappointed!  We ordered the highly suggested Beef Roll and received what seemed to be a cold, Mexican burrito.  It was dry and tasteless.  We also ordered the steamed juicy buns, which were no more than pork dumplings.  The rest of the meal consisted of Walnut Shrimp, Tofu with Black Bean Sauce and Veggie Chow Mein.  They were ok...nothing that lived up to the great reviews.  The service wasn't much to brag about either.  The entrees came out sporadically and we weren't hungry by the time the last item arrived.  Also, the waiter was hard to track down and we had to follow up a few times for items we requested.  Our overall experience was lackluster and I have to give it the thumbs down!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: You park at the bottom. You pay at the bottom. You ride to the top.

It was too cold to walk around, but I may take advantage of this site in the summer with or without the hot dog deal. (I hope with.)\\n\\nOn the way down, the car was jam-packed and so very awkward.

I should have trusted my gut when Brad actually answered the phone in the middle of  our first meeting. We tried to refinance a house through Noble Home Loans and it was by far the worst experience (the process took 8 MONTHS) and we wasted over $1,000.00. He claims that it is illegal for his company to pay for the appraisal up front and makes the customer pay for it. Which I found out later is a complete lie. We ended up having to pay for two appraisals because his staff is incompetent and could not refinance our house in the appropriate time. After 8 months, we were told the documents were finally completed and we could go sign. We were told that we would not have to come up with any money at closing. I was unsure about that and asked them repeatedly if it was going to cost us anything. Brad and his staff said NO. When we got to the signing the gentleman asked where the money was- we owed over $1500 in closing costs. WHAT!! \\n\\nWe ended up walking away and I found an amazing loan officer that same day. Our house was financed from start to finish in less than 30 days. The closing costs were very clear from the beginning AND he paid for the appraisal up front. His motto is that the customer never has to pay for something up front. WoW!\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the gentleman that referred us to Brad end up getting in a fight with Brad as well and switched to my current loan officer. Honestly, I am baffled that this company is still in business.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Hello all,\\nWhen reviewing restaurants I use a rating system that looks at all aspects of their Menu, Decor, Food, Service & Price. A restaurant can score up to 5 points per category and a perfect score would be 25 points.\\n\\nMenu:  2 Stars: The menu was available online which I really like and it was presented in a clean and easy to read format.  I am giving a low score here because I got turned off when I saw  a vegetable tempura app on the menu of a fine dining steakhouse.  Typically I like concise menus, however this menu was lacking options.\\nDecor:  4 Stars: I found the decor and ambiance of the restaurant tomb fantastic.  I really liked the look and style, it blended well with their concept.\\nFood:  2.5 Stars: Average is all I can say about the food here.  The appetizer I selected for the table was a crab stuffed mushroom which was deep fried and served on a plate with 3 different sauces, 2 on the plate for garnish and one for dipping.  I would not order this again. My salad was terrible, I am still not sure how a fine dining steakhouse can mess up a house salad and as for my entree the only thing I liked about my steak was it's size.  Although after I cut off all the fat there wasn't much meat left.  Did not get dessert as the choices were less then impressive.\\nService: 3 Stars: I liked the fact that bottled Voss water is flowing like champagne at at a wedding at no extra charge.  The wait staff was efficient but not that which you would typically see in a fancy steakhouse.  I asked about the daily specials and for a dinner recommendation and was not impressed by their knowledge and delivery.\\nPrice: 3 Stars: I would say the average entree was $25, a little high for the location and quality but not outrageous.  Overall dinner was about $40 per person with tax & tip.\\n\\nMy overall rating, 14.5 of 25 lands this place 2 Stars, as I would not return here nor would I recommend it.  \\n\\n~Signed, Las Vegas Yelper 1116\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Hair Pollution is funky and cool.

I've had a 'do with layers before, and I loved it.  But I thought, what the hay, she may know what she's talking about and give me a kick-ass 'do.  I don't like it.

It seemed like something she should have warned me about.\\n\\nIt's not a horrible cut, and it wasn't terribly expensive ($45 -- my last salon charged $55).

They rarely cover the pizza in cheese and toppings, but remember that the cheese and pepperoni pizzas are just $5.

Prepare for $35-40/person for a burger, fries and drink.\\n\\nWe really looked forward to Burgr, and if you are a fan of Ramsay's you will notice the menu follows his ideas. It is simple, small and straight-forward.  They try to incorporate technology as they have iPad's for the drink/dessert menu and at the end of the meal provide a survey that you use an iPod for.\\n\\nOverall, there was a nice selection of beers on tap. The food was good, not the greatest burger I have ever had, but it was definitely a good burger. The Parmesan Fries were pretty good too.  Most couples split an order of fries.\\n\\nWhat ruins the food though is the horrible service. The servers seem only interested in bringing your food and not seeing if you are doing fine. While we were eating out meal, our server interupted us to ask if we wanted dessert before we were even done our food.  Then, while still eating our food (after turning down dessert) our bill was tossed onto the table.\\n\\nUsually these sort of restaurants in Vegas have great service, service that makes you forget about having to wait for your food. But the horrible service took away from the entire experience. \\n\\nI cannot recommend this restaurant.

We made a reservation and were seated right away. They have a coat check which is really nice in the winter. There is enough room for you to move around here while still keeping the atmosphere really intimate. Heritage has a  unique drink and dinner menu (with a lot of ingredients I have never heard of!). I got a cider (they have one on tap!). We also got a bunch of appetizers including a meat and cheese plate, lamb tartare, and the shrimp tempura. The meat and cheese plate included pickled watermelon rinds which I had never had before, I thought they were good but definitely not for everyone I was with. The lamb tartare was served with potato chips and the combination was great. I didn't eat the tempura (as you can expect it's not gluten free) but everyone at the table really liked it, especially since it came with deep fried, bacon wrapped cheese curds. The menu has vegetarian and gluten free options clearly labeled. I had the chicken with crawfish cream sauce (gluten free!) for my entree and really enjoyed it. We were really impressed with the wine list as well. Only downside of Heritage Tavern is that the service is kind of slow. Our server kept leaving before anyone could ask her a question/order another drink, and it took a long time for our credit card to picked up.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: When I first walked in, it took me a couple minutes to learn the format of how you should serve yourself. Immediately you face the biggest challenge of which flavor of yogurt to chose. There is  flavor for everyone, from the indulgent to the more health-conscious. If you want, you can also mix several of the flavors if you cannot choose. One of the most important aspects is that not only can you chose how little or how much yogurt you fill in your cup, but you can chose as many toppings as you want. You pay by the weight here at Yogurtland, not the amount of toppings like other yogurt or ice cream shops. Consequently, paying by the weight makes you unsure of your final price until you pay at the register. The important thing is that regardless of your budget, you can still enjoy something here, but understand you must sacrifice the amount if you want to pay the lowest price. I have always been greeted warmly by the cashier who have kept everything well stocked from the toppings to the yogurt mix. Call me dorky, but I even liked the large plastic pink spoons that you receive. This place also has a free water dispenser if your cup tastes a little too rich. Anytime I've been here, it has been busy with people and families of all ages. Therefore, it can be extremely difficult to find a seat if you want to get comfortable and enjoy your cup.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: First off, shout out to Marti, thanks for being a gracious mixologist! \\n\\nAlso to Cameron for the amazing service, it's always great to have a waiter who can make great recommendations for all our different eating palettes!\\n\\nMy team at Zappos was going to see Wicked showcasing at The Smith Center, collectively we all decided to try Triple George to start off our evening.\\n\\nWhat a great choice.\\n\\nSitting at the Bar to treat ourselves to a cocktail during happy hour was a nice experience, Marti greeted us with a smile, and when she found out we were going to see Wicked - she had to share her personal experience from having watched the show and she was genuinely excited for the 6 of us.\\n\\nThe lovely hostess led us to our table and the charming personality of Cameron just kept our enjoyment going with refreshment offerings, as well as appetizer specials. \\n\\nFrom the Bread basket with the butter and white wine vinegar to the arrival of our Caprese Bruschetta &  Spinach dip.\\n\\nThe ambiance of this place is a bit like an old English hall which has a bit of an echoey resonance, but we felt very much secluded enough to enjoy conversation amongst ourselves.\\n\\nOur waiter Cameron was helpful in giving his insightful help to choose our next rounds of cocktails, also shortly followed by our nicely plated entrees.\\n\\nFood was great, we enjoyed the staff who interacted with us, I think I will find myself here again to enjoy another evening in the near future.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Seriously, you're a bar inside a hotel and you serve a transient clientele.

He didn't even ask if he could make us something else.  Dude, you work in a bar in a hotel.

The boss recommended that we add brown sugar to it to add some sweetness. It was like drinking ice green tea brewed from hot tea! It was refreshing. It maybe a bit bland especially if you like your drinks really sweet, but my main complaint is things are always too sweet and this was perfect. The boss was really nice and he does recommend things to you and gives suggestions. The people who were working up front with orders and the cashier seemed to struggle a little. But considering this place is new they were still really nice and provided service. They corrected our order because originally they gave us just an ice matcha tea without the ice cream but it was corrected in no time. We played some jenga. The owner said whoever the first winner of jenga is gets a fruit tart. I won! :D. But because I'm nice I shared it with my BF who lost twice btw ;).\\n\\nSecond visit, the place was pretty much packed and not as empty as it was the very first time.

I can't even tell you that it had the brewed tea taste AND it wasn't extremely sweet either! PERFECT! The boba was a little too chewy for me.

I'd have to agree with a lot of others in that the atmosphere is just a little too stuffy for my own personal taste.  It's a nice place, and you really don't have to dress up - we went in jeans - but it's just so \\\"pretty\\\".  The staff is nice, they are relatively attentive and all, but it just seems so wrong.  I'd much rather go somewhere that's a little grizzled.\\n\\nIn any case the menus were delivered and we decided to try the spring roll appetizers, and they were actually quite good.  I liked that there were two of us, and they split the appetizer onto two plates.  That's a nice touch.  Most places give you one plate and you're left to do it yourself.  Another nice thing is that the bread comes with melted butter.  That's cool.\\n\\nI ordered the sea bass, on the suggestion of the server, who said it is \\\"far and away\\\" the best thing on the menu, while my wife had a sirloin.  The flavor of the fish was good, but it was just so sponge-like I had a difficult time eating it.  The texture was just strange.  The steak, meanwhile, was really good.  Odd, at a seafood place.\\n\\nOverall, it was decent, but it wasn't cheap by any means.

The line was amazingly long- we waited about an hour to get in.  When we finally got inside we were seated near huge glass windows that showed us the night view of the Strip- very pretty!  \\n\\nThere is a large international selection of foods at the buffet, and most of the fare tasted fine. Nothing was spectacular, and nothing was horrible. The deserts looked and tasted like the standard array you get at the casinos buffets. The meal came to about $100 for the five of us.\\n\\nThe casino itself is nicely-designed, although casinos tend to all look alike. The one thing that made this casino a little different was the self-service beverage station. Instead of waiting for a scantily clad woman to bring you your drink, those who prefer non-alcoholic beverages can service themselves.  Unfortunately, patrons can be slobs, so the station was sloppy. Too bad people have to ruin a good thing.\\n\\nMy opinion of M is that it is nice-looking and offers a nice off-Strip place for locals to visit. I wouldn't want to stay there if I were visiting Vegas because I'd rather be on the Strip where all the action is, but if you want to be away from the Strip and still have the casino experience, this would do. As for the buffet, though I liked it, it is not worth more than 15 minutes in line.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Wow... A good burger joint from California not named \\\"In-N-Out\\\".

I gotta admit, I was in a bad mood after parking, then walking by Geri's and  it appears the place has permanently closed - downer.\\n\\nSo I walk in TT and confused by the lay out - a bottle neck at the register made it difficult to get to the apparent front of the store.

I went with an al pastor and an asada taco along with a Mexican corn.  \\n\\nAs I sat in my car looking at the food, I frequently compared what I saw with what I get at El Gordo.  I feel the tacos are slightly larger at EG.  Also believe the pastor at EG is more flavorful.  Frankly, I found the TT food had little flavor.   The  corn - basically uncooked and not much in the way of cheese. I did like the sauce selection and the service was friendly.

The servers't interested, the food was just ok and the place wasashed. It was disgusting actually. We will never go again:\n\n: When I first walked in, it took me a couple to learn the format of how you should yourself. Immediately you face the biggest challenge of which flavor of yogurt to chose. There is  flavor for everyone, from the indulgent the more health-conscious. If you want, can also mix several of the flavors if you cannot choose. One of the most important aspects is that not only you chose how or much yogurt you fill in your cup, but you can chose as many toppings you want. You pay by the weight here at Yogurtland, not the amount of toppings like other yogurt or ice cream shops., paying by weight makes you unsure of your final price until you pay the register. The important thing is that regardless of your budget, you can still enjoy something here, but understand you must sacrifice the amount if you want to pay the lowest price. I have always been greeted warmly by the cashier who have kept everything well stocked from the toppings to the yogurt mix. Call meorky but I even liked the large plastic pinkons that you receive.

It maybe a bit bland especially you like your drinks sweet but my main complaint is things are always too sweet and this was perfect. The boss was really nice and he does recommend things to you and gives suggestions. The people who were working front with orders and the cashier seemed to struggle a little. But considering this place is new they were still really nice and provided service.

I went to google and searched for good reviews for tailors and alterations.\\n\\nI called three stores and received firm answers stating \\\"we don't alter jerseys\\\". When I called Smart Fit Alterations I was given a confident \\\"yes, we will assist\\\". Upon arriving to the store I saw a wedding dress in the window, sucked up my masculinity, and knew I was placing my clothes in the hands of professionals. Within 10 minutes the jerseys were sized, money exchanged, and a wait of 10 days took place before my clothes were ready.\\n\\nI had read a review stating that their phone etiquette left something to be desired. A brash \\\"Hello.\\\" with no business company tagline prompted my question on today's hours for MLK Day. Another brash \\\"Yes.\\\" was met and I got into my car to receive my clothes.\\n\\nUpon arrival my clothes were given back to me clean in plastic and altered to perfection. My XXXL jersey fit like any hockey jersey should and a shortened length to my basketball jersey were both perfectly altered. Although the phone skills leave much to be desired, you can not take away from these ladies (yes, two women run the business) on their alteration skills.\\n\\nTWO THUMBS UP! $34 + $14 = $48 saved my jerseys and I will be sure to have my shirts tailored by Smart Fit in the future as well.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Tried the Diplo- a saison I'd love to drink all day!

But, as with other hotel-casinos, it'sbeing de-themed, which to me is a shame.  After all, the Egyptian theme was supposed to be the big draw to get people in the door.  I think it still draws people in, but once inside you're like, okaaaaaaay, so this is it?  Then it's on to the next stop.\\n\\nThe casino is fine for gambling.  All the usual selections are present.  I played a Wizard of Oz machine for quite some time without an appearance from a cocktail waitress.  So moved on to the next stop to find a waitress willing  to provide me with a complimentary cool, refreshing adult beverage to quench my thirst.

Hotel staff wasn't friendly and always seemed distracted. Was kept up until after midnight on 10/20 due to laud music from the hotel pool. We were on the 31st floor, so I can't imagine what the lower floors were experiencing. I called down to the front desk, and their only solution was ear plugs which I already had. Called again, then they blamed the noise on the Four Seasons. No apologies, just a suck it up sort of attitude. Upon checkout, spoke with the manager and encountered the same sort of demeanor.

We were chilly by the time we approached the hostess stand, so we decided to run back home and make our own pancakes.\\n\\nBut now - totally different experience!  They are using in and outdoors - which if you ask me is ALWAYS how it should be no matter what the weather is like. I love eating outside.  Some folks have that bug-attracting-gene and never have good outdoor eating experiences.  But I digress.... so there's no more hostess stand, which actually threw us off a bit as we walked in, but someone saw us and ran right over so that works for me (pssst - I'd bring back the hostess stand!).\\n\\nThe omelets are a good size, but not TOO big.  The Belgian waffle is nice and fluffy.  They had a Banana Nut pancake special when we were there that looked tasty.  The wife really wanted plain pancakes, but only the special and blueberry were on the menu.  We saw someone else getting plain pancakes (that looked a-frickin-mazing) and asked the server about it.  Apparently you can order the blueberry pancakes and just say \\\"hold the blueberry\\\".  Good to know!\\n\\nSo, food was good, it's beautiful to look at but let me mention something here that no one else has yet.  This is a spot that folks rent out for weddings or big parties.  We first came to this place well before they were doing food when we were looking for a wedding location.  Want to know why  the wall decor is super simple and the space doesn't \\\"feel\\\" like a restaurant?  Because last night it was a pink princess themed wedding and later tonight it will be a Bar Mitzvah.  That outdoor dining space is the dance floor one night and happy hour spot the next.  This will also explain why they have a table set up near the entry with wedding photo books and other similarly themed things. \\n\\nSpeaking of that - lets talk about folks working there.  On our first time eating there a woman came up to us as we were leaving and asked if we'd finally gotten married.  Haven't seen her in at least 8 months, and only talked to her 2-3 other times before that, but she stopped to mention it and say congrats.  Heck of a memory - and extra sweet since we obviously hadn't chosen her location (though it was one of the top 3!)\\n\\nNice spot.  Nice view.  Nice food.  Nice folks.  Definitely the kind of place you want to enjoy, and support.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: What a great place! Comfortable, welcoming and most importantly; delicious!\\n\\nStarted with crab gazpacho, smoked salmon and chive grilled cheese, deviled eggs and a tomato/ polenta/avacados salad. All 4 of them were great! I would suggest all 4 of them as starters.\\n\\nFor dinner, the 4 of us, we split 3 entrees; the burger, lobster roll and tacos (three fish, one octopus). The burger and tacos were amazing. The burger, may be the best is town! White bun, great meat with the perfect amount of seasoning, the secret sauce with iceberg lettuce. Nothing fancy, but perfectly done. Friggin great!! The fish tacos were huge and soo good! Both salsas were extremely flavorful. I liked the fish over the octopus, but it was close. The octopus was meatier than I expected and grilled to perfection.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was ehhh, but take with a grain of salt, as I am not a huge fan of lobster.\\n\\nTavern only serves beer and wine. \\n\\nThis is a top-notch restaurant with very attentive service! I can't wait to come back!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: BEAUTIFUL hotel. I love the sleek, modern look of this place for both the room itself and the hotel in general. It's a good contrast from it's sister hotel Mandalay Bay (which is more sunny and colorful), this is more of a cooler, darker look. On decor and service itself, I'd give this place a 4.5.\\n\\nHere's why I ended up giving it a 3\\n\\n- Having a room on a high floor has it's consequences. The music coming from Mix Lounge was so obnoxiously loud that I could hear it from the bathroom, with the door closed. This can either be a bad/doesn't matter thing. On the one hand, it's Vegas so no one sleeps that early anyway ( I think they stopped by 2am. It was a weekday) but on the other, my bf and I had an early flight to catch the next morning so we couldn't fall asleep. It was pretty damn loud.\\n- Our shower smelled like sulfur and it was strong enough that we had to leave the bathroom and close the door. It was bad enough that neither of us would even dare use the shower. The weird thing is the bathtub was completely fine. When we called guest services to complain, we were surprised to hear \\\"we've gotten this complaints from lower floors but not from the high floors.\\\" So you're telling me you're aware of this problem and haven't done anything about it? Boo\\n- Dirty stains on the sheets right when we came in. It was the first thing we noticed because it was pretty big\\n\\nOverall, I think this hotel has one of the nicest decors I've ever seen but those problems really brought the rating down. I will say this though, the hotel staff was very quick to fix our problems (our sheets were changed within 5 minutes) and were very accommodating (they offered us a free night stay for next time, if we ever decided to come back)\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: They were very busy for breakfast and had trouble with their time management.

They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.\\n\\nA disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.\\n\\nNext, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.\\n\\nThe one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.\\n\\nLike the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.\\n\\nBLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Best pho on this side of town.  Not as good as the Spring Mountain location, but a really good substitute when you can't make it across town.  Egg rolls are the bomb, chicken bun is one of my faves, and the #31 is my go to dish!\\n\\nBiggest drawback is the service is kind of slow.  Food comes out pretty quick but sometimes it can be a wait to get drinks and/or the check.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Food was great! Service was spectacular! We had a birthday dinner here and they set us up in a private room. The decor is quaint and cute.  Loved the steak and Chicken Cajun shrimp, delicious! They made my son feel so special on his bday!

Soft Indian music played in the background, & both booths & tables are available for seating.\\n\\nMy server brought over plenty of hot, seasoned Naan bread as I went for some of their vegetable soup, to find that only tiny bowls were available to get some of it in!

The temperature of everything was about right, the foods weren't too soupy, as they sometimes are at these places, & the taste of everything was excellent for the most part, if a little salty.

After some brief checking about the company, my wife and I had no reason to go against the realtor's recommendation.  My first bit of apprehension started when I asked to be present for the inspection and to be allowed to shadow inspector while he did his job.  This was mainly for my own piece of mind about the flipped property we were about to purchase.  I was dissuaded from being present.  I could have forced the issue but had no reason not to trust their integrity or ability.  \\n\\nDuring our walk-through with the inspector, after he examined the house, he provided us a very concise, professional and helpful report, complete with pictures and explanations.  He gave the house an outstanding thumb up, finding just a few minor issues.\\n\\nFast forward two weeks.  It was our first full day in the house and we had several contractors working around the house and in the attic.  One by one they contacted us with moderate to more than one major issue that they discovered just walking the property and attic.  The issues included duct work damage, water/dry wall damage, electrical work out of code and HVAC issues.  Mind you these contractors were not there to address those issues; they simply observed them as they jumped out to someone versed in the construction business.  \\n\\nThis type of thing continued for approximately 9 months and expanded to include plumbing, additional electric and roofing issues.  Every time we had a worker discover a new issue we heard the same mantra, \\\"Didn't you have a home inspection?\\\"  We are now over $10,000 into the house just to fix issues that other contractors agreed should have been easily found during the initial home inspection.  \\n\\nThe most disappointing part of the story is that after getting our realtor involved, who had used this company for years, the owner, Tom Sanders, refused to contact me to discuss what I thought was an inadequate inspection.  After more than two weeks of arguing, Mr. Sanders finally gave in and left a voicemail on my phone.  I returned his call less than an hour later, got his voicemail and left a message.  I never heard back.  To this day, and after several angry calls to him, he has only ever contact me once to discuss the situation.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Good food. Had the chicken kabobs.

Hey, I was out of the office for this and another half hour from work on a Friday wasn't gonna kill me!\\nThey threw in free wiper blades to make up for my wait.  Changed all my filters - air, A/C AND, of course, the oil.\\nULTRA-friendly staff, service was excellent.  They normally vacuum my car, but I told them to skip it since I had to detail my car the next day anyway.  \\\"Are you sure, Amy?\\\"\\nThey knew my name, used it often during my visit, and didn't treat me like a bimbo for being a woman in an auto car place.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Not the best native, but it isn't bad.

I always judge Indian restaurants on the following:\\n-Saag with Shrimp - best saag I've had in Las Vegas. I ordered it a 0/10 for spiciness and it came out mild like I asked for. The shrimp was way overcooked and chewy, so I might order it plain next time.\\n-Chicken Tikka Masala - ok. My friend loved it. I thought it was a little sweet & tangy.\\n-Garlic Naan - very good.\\n-Lacha Paratha - terrible. They really shouldn't have served it to us in the condition it was in. It came out like some crackers falling apart. It was so dry and crumbly that we really didn't eat it.

Anyways, I got into my massage on time.  This is where it got disappointing.  I told the massage therapist to do a 3 on a scale of 1-5 but she did it too hard.  I asked her to lighten up but it still was too painful.  I have had many massages before and this was the worst.  She also talked a lot.\\n\\nUpon checkout, I was talked to forever about signing up for their plan.  But how can I do that after that massage?

This may not reflect on all their teachers, but for me - this it it with music masters.\\n\\nWhat was worse is, when I reported this to the management - they were not apologetic at all until I told him I may report this.  He was justifying the behavior and said some parents like teachers to be that way. What parents are those???? :) No kiddin. \\n\\nAnyway, to their credit, he fixed the damaged instrument free of cost.

Because this was our first visit, Pam, our exceptional waitress, comped us the parmesan bread and it is delicious...next time we visit, I will gladly pay for the scrumptious bread.  The menu is vairied, lots of beef and ribs, seafood and more.  I won't go into what we ate because I humbly believe that whatever you order will be delicious and plentiful.  The atmosphere is a little noisy but that's OK, the vibe makes for the dining experience.  You could go crazy looking at all the sports memorabelia, if you are sports fan, any sport, you will find something to ooh and ahh over.  I have to repeat, Pam our waitress was terrific.  They were unusually busy that night because of a large take-out order that came as a surprise to the restaurant and the wait for our main dish was a little long.  Pam made sure we were informed that all was in order and to be candid, it was nice having a little time between our salads and the main dish.  I understand that a diner or two could have a less than perfect visit to any restaurant but I don't understand how anyone could rate Don and Charlie's anything less than 5 stars.

It is an eating experience that you won't forget, and while I have mixed feelings on the experience, overall I think it was a good one. If you're a first timer to Chino, it can be a little overwhelming listening to their 10 minute introduction on how to order and combine the different foods. The lady was very helpful in her explanation, and I ended up telling her to give me whatever she liked best. The food itself was pretty good overall, I enjoyed some of the combinations a lot more than others.

Not only that but she also made various mistakes on our order. All of this was going on while manager was clearly standing next to her. He did absolutely nothing to help us or clarify anything. The food, itself, is not as appetizing especially for it's price. I do not recommend getting the sisig fries.

I was amazed that Komol was so close to Lotus, pleasantly surprised that it was open, and ecstactic with the quality of the food and friendly service.  This is an excellent choice for vegetarians (60% of their business is the vegetarian dishes).  I immensely enjoyed the pork panang, and look forward to sampling the fish dishes on future and frequent visits.

The scallops were good, I've had better but there were about 6/7 large sized which is unusual. The mac n cheese was so tasty (asiago, parm, w/truffles). Spinach was excellent. Well prepared not too garlicky or oniony(such words) idk...but nonetheless, great!\\n\\nI broke down and ordered dessert (the waiter advised us in the beginning that its takes 15 min). Came out on fire, literally..A pineapple upside down cake with rum (i think), whipped cream, and a divine caramel sauce! OMG..the other table was gawking over the setting. It was incredible, a must try! \\n\\nOverall, this was a great place. Unpretentious, elegant yet casual enough..I WILL be going back..Oh yeah, 100 bucks including two glasses of 7 Merlot that was easy on the palate!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I went to Silky's Crows Nest last night with a friend as it was a gorgeous day and we wanted a nice, outside ambiance. This hit the spot! The deck was gorgeous and the view of the marina was the best of the Allegheny.\\n\\nHowever, there were several things that made our evening go downhill.\\n\\nWhen we arrived there was no server to greet us and stood several minutes with others until someone took care of us.\\n\\nMy friend and I decided to order appetizers to share around 7pm. Chicken nachos, fried zucchini slices and waffle fries. 2.5 hrs later we still did NOT have our food and others around us did (even those who came in after us). This was absolutely ridiculous!!!!  I could feel myself fuming. \\n\\nI decided to speak to the manager on duty and they took one appetizer off our bill. For all the time we had to wait it should have been free! \\n\\nWhen the food finally came it was not even that good, but we ate it anyway since we were starving...\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I like this place because it is one of the very few places that serve Illy coffee. It reminded me of a cafe in Rome. Located in the Cosmopolitan, it is convenient place to get your coffee and food to go. Also, they have quick eats here like sandwiches, salads, and pastries. The place doesn't have a table, but you can stand and get a quick bite. There is no better place for your coffee than Va Bene.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Panda Express, I wish I could quit you! Especially after I stupidly keep coming back to this location. The staff here can't multi-task. When they try to, that's when people's food starts to get mixed up and down and around. Let's focus on one person at a time. That's great that you want to help 10 people at a time but again the staff can't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you'd like a 3 item entree. *slow blinks* He's way too flustered. \\n\\nYou guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly have to remind you for the third item like 5 times? \\n\\nThe last time I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain wasn't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take our order.  Eventually something clicked up there that paying customers were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting to get service. OMG\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I have been to Oggi's many many many times. The food has always been great, the service is always helpful and accommodating but the beer is even better. You come to a pizza and beer place for just that but they give you so much more.

The decor is beautiful and well done, the staff is friendly and the food and drinks are quite good.  We tried the corn dog bites, the edamame fritters and the wood fired grilled plate for our entrees.  It was all pretty good, but nothing to rush back for.  However, the drinks were tasty and well mixed - I highly recommend the Marvin Gardens...yummy!\\n\\nI will definitely be back for happy hour and hope the menu might get changed up a little bit.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Service is bad, bad, bad. Although the food is okay portion, the staff there brings this rating way down. \\n\\nI was there during a lunch rush, although it wasn't completely slammed, a female server was heard yelling from the kitchen about how SHE IS F****** WORKING!!!! Crickets after that and everyone in the dining area turned that direction in complete shock. \\n\\nAside from this little mishap,  you can't get seated, order you meal, get your check and pay in a timely fashion at all. I almost left exact change when I got my bill, but decided tip lite anyway. \\n\\nFood is full of grease, just about everything on their lunch menu is fried. What a disappointment. \\n\\nI won't be back and I hope for the sake of this place they will consider hiring staff with some customer service skills. \\n\\nOh and WTF, FOX news is the only news network they show!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I came here on Monday to celebrate Father's Day. My brother recommended this place. We went during happy hour, nice happy hour selection! A lot of rolls to choose  from. I also liked the Hawaiian fusion they had to their food. However, maybe it was the day, but I thought the fish could have been fresher. I also ordered the fish tacos which were good but  I was not expecting them to be fried. Therefore, I would also suggest adding fish tacos that do not have fried fish to the menu.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So Opa Life has taken over the space formally occupied by My Big Fat Greek Express as apparently the parent company of Opa Life bought out MBFGE per my conversation with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed here was that they did a really nice job renovating the old space that was dingy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing.\\n\\nSadly the second thing I noticed was the sticker shock of this place compared to MBFGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up across the board.\\n\\nI got the special which was a combo deal of chicken pita, drink and a side for $9. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on the pita it was pretty much red onion and taziki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked.\\n\\nThey just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it will be hard to convince myself to come this way often.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I almost want to only give 1 start in hopes I can get seated faster, but that is my only complaint which means you are doing the simple things to perfection. Finally got to bring my girlfriend here on Saturday 8/10/13, arrived around 7pm, told a 30 minute wait, not bad in my opinion. We moved the car closer, then just decided to head down to the Waterfront to waste some time. 40 minutes later my cell rang and we were seated. Now the wait for food was much longer that I would have liked, but it was well worth every second! I don't even know where to start. I ordered the brisket, ribs and chicken apple tacos, she had the chicken and the brisket and we shared the jalapeno apple slaw and of course the mac n cheese. We wanted to try the chorizo but they were out. (just an excuse to come back and fuel my new addiction). The next time we will be getting our own mac n cheese that's for sure! I cannot say what taco was the best because they were all so good and unique in their own way. Experiment with their sauces as well. I got the Smoke 3 pepper and the apricot habanero, without any sauce and then trying one of the other completely changed the flavor profile in to something new, each bite incredible.\\n\\nThe place and the menu are very simple, but the real star is the food! KEEP IT THIS WAY! Never sell out!\\n\\nAlso, the staff was amazing, each one helping the other out, no one went without attention.\\n\\n\\nI will be there often Smoke, thank you for a new \\\"addiction\\\"\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We eat here for breakfast every time we are in Vegas. On our last trip (923/10 to 9/27/10) we decided we try another place closer to the strip and it only made us appreciate the Sourdough Cafe more! Our steaks are always cooked to order, the over easy eggs are NOT greasy and the coffee is good! \\n\\nWe usually just dine and dash but this time we were wonderfully surprised with a NO SMOKING room to play video poker! I was one happy girl with a cup of hot joe, video poker and smoke free air-all in one casino!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The manager Amy Walter on 407 E Green Street in Champaign, IL is horrible. I bought an HP ink the day before but the ink can't print, I went to the store to ask for returning and she slandered me, saying I took my old one there. I don't think I will sell my integrity for a 20 bucks ink. Ridiculous mean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I found myself in Phoenix, and the Golden Coin called out to me.\\n\\nWas it the minimal selection of only 8 or 9 options, at least two of them not at all Chinese, that brought me back? Certainly, I ate my fill of crisp wonton strips, fried rice, egg rolls, stir-fried vegetables, and the inevitable sweet and sour pork. I avoided completely the fried chicken and the french fries, and didn't regret my choice. I tried the chow mein noodles but didn't go back for more. I lamented the lack of lemon chicken, a favorite of mine from when I came here over 20 years ago.\\n\\nWas it the price? $7 and change for your fill of Chinese food and a drink is pretty reasonable by any standard, even if the selection isn't much to look at and the food itself doesn't stand out either. Service is kept to a minimum - your money (cash only please!) is taken as you enter and water and/or a soda of your choice is brought to a table chosen for you while you load up your plate. Empty plates are taken away regularly, and food is replenished periodically from behind the mysterious doors where it sounds like a lot of cooking is happening.\\n\\nWas it the ambience of a cash-only business with a single room for seating, the sounds of the cooking behind the scenes nearly drowned out by the sound of someone watching their Chinese film on a portable DVD player behind the counter? The worn tables and plastic plates that look just as they did 20 years ago, shaped vaguely like alien faces from the classic 1950's version of 'War of the Worlds'?\\n\\nThe truth is that it was all of these things. Mike Kwan's Golden Coin is neither great nor terrible. The selection is limited, the food only fair (though I love those wonton crisps!), the service is minimal, and the price is right. But Golden Coin remains today mostly like what it was 20+ years ago, right down to the worn tables and the alien-face plates. Walking in and smelling the food is a strong dose of nostalgia, and remains a consistent experience in a world filled with change.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Do not visit the GOLD LOUNGE for OPEN BaR!!!!!

I liked the jars of ingredients and its calm, hip tone to the restaurant. Fresh from playing cards from Caesars, my buddies wanted some asian noodles in the bellagio. The wait to get in was about 20-30mins. I wasn't pissed at line to get in (other people in the line were, especially a group of trekkies?) \\n\\nI mean its Vegas and gamblers have to eat sometime? \\n\\nSo, we sat down ordered and I decided to go with some spicy chicken noodle dish. It was quite hot and spicy when I tasted it. It took a total of 5 mins for them to muster it up. I was shocked at the cooking times of this noodle joint and I think I knew why.... Because 10mins after my meal, I could not hold it down. I spent prolly the next hour in the casino's well maintained bathrooms. I was hurling my brains out and spewing chunks. \\n\\nThis was one of the worst food experiences.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Make that a tray please!\\n\\nAny place that has chicken nuggets, chicken quesadillas and corn dogs has a side is a-okay with me!\\n\\nWhen I need a really good hamburger quick, Cookout is my go to spot! You can smell that grilled smokey goodness a mill before you get to the actual drive thru. Being that this location is so close to UNC Charlotte it gets pretty crowded on the weekends, so the double drive thru really helps get cars in and out. There's also a walk up window you can order at too. Like most Cookout locations there's no dine in eating area. They've got a couple of seats outside but just take your food and go home and eat.\\n\\nThe menu has a good selection of burgers, hotdogs, BBQ and chicken sandwiches. You can turn any meal into a tray, getting two sides and a drink. As I mentioned earlier these aren't typical sides, goes way above fries...the sides within themselves can be a meal. Want something sweet? They've have several different flavors of milkshake, and I use the term milkshake loosely because it's so thick it's literally ice cream in a cup. Of course they've got the basics like chocolate and vanilla but wait! They've got heath bar, Snickers, Oreo and seasonal flavors such as watermelon and peach.\\n\\nI wanna give them four stars but they lost one because they've messed up my order more then a few times. So make sure you're checking your food before leaving.\\n\\nTwo thumbs up for this cheap, delicious, and filling meal!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Now known as a new name, I believe it was called \\\"Yo Fresh\\\".\\n\\nThe inside was kind of dirty and the fro yo machines were mostly broken. The smoothie was really sugary and not \\\"fresh\\\" like the name implies. \\n\\nMy hope is that they are brand new and working on fixing the place up.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: My wife and I ate here for the first time on 10/24/14, invited by our Turkish neighbor who tries to eat there once a week.  We agree with all of the positive reviews and comments already listed here.  Food was very fresh and delicious.  We had the combo kabobs of beef and chicken skewers and they were outstanding.  Even the french fries were excellent.  Service was good and attentive.  We will definitely be returning in the near future.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This place just opened so a lot of items on their menu aren't up yet. However if you're a fan of El Pulgarcito de America this is owned by the same people (and within walking distance of the other restaurant, just on the other side of Ben Thanh). You will recognize some of the menu items from El Pulgarcito, though when we went they did not have several things on the menu yet because of the recent opening.\\n\\nLike El Pulgarcito, our server had minimal English. Fortunately I speak Spanish fluently so this was not a problem for me. The parking situation is definitely better than El Pulgarcito, too. \\n\\nWhat I had isn't exactly on the menu - it's just the regular breakfast, but they were happy to serve the eggs Ranchero style with salsa verde upon request. The eggs were cooked perfectly, over easy with a runny yolk. The salsa verde was wonderful (a tiny bit spicier than the green sauce at El Pulgarcito). The nice thick Mexican crema went perfectly too, scooping up a little crema for each bite of egg. The steak was well-done, but tender and simply (but perfectly) seasoned. The refried beans come on the side and had a wonderful flavor as well. The tortillas served on the side were thick, like they are at El Pulgarcito, but the crispy tortillas under the eggs were nice and thin. I think this breakfast is, overall, a touch better than El Pulgarcito - which is really saying something.\\n\\nThe 4 stars is both high in anticipation of the quality and goodness at El Pulgarcito (just Mexican), and not yet 5 stars since my first 2 requests weren't available yet even though they were on the menu. So this rating may change after a few visits.\\n\\nI did snag one of the little take out menus (from my last visit to El Pulgarcito, actually) so I'll scan that and add soon.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Where do I even start with this one...\\n\\nFirst off, let me say that the staff was friendly and welcoming.  And that was where the positive experience ended.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I stopped in here on a Saturday on the way to a friend's house because we were looking for a quick bite and this place had good reviews.  I love good frybread so I was excited to see what this place had to offer.  I was sadly disappointed.\\n\\nI tried the Dev's chicken dish and my girlfriend tried another dish that I can't recall the name of.  I really can't believe that what came out was the standard that this place goes by.  The frybread itself wasn't bad but was pretty bland.  The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.\\n\\nShortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.\\n\\nPlease understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.  It tasted like drinking cantaloupe juice.\\n\\nIf you are a frybread company then you should at least do the frybread really well and then build on top of that.  This place just didn't have it together I'm afraid.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: this place is a little weird, i gotta say. i've been to the others and very much enjoyed my meals/cocktails. this location is just ok. we've now been 3 times. sushi prices are pretty high, but the sushi was good on all 3 occasions so i'll tolerate the prices. there's no happy hour, which is a disappointment but there are drink specials during certain televised sports games - the specials end once the game ends.  \\n\\nthe design of the restaurant is awkward, with 2 booths back to back across from the bar and completely separate from the rest of the restaurant. the ceiling is high and the restaurant gets very, very loud on a saturday night. the saturday night we visited we stopped at the bar for a drink while we waited for our table and the bartender greeted our party of 4 with \\\"i need your IDs if you're going to sit here\\\". we of course provided them, but given that this is a service establishment a kinder and friendlier greeting (\\\"Hi, how are you?\\\") would have been appreciated, followed by a respectful request for our IDs.\\n\\nthere are a lot of tables, but there is definitely room for more. the restaurant would benefit from a professional designer. our teppan chef was less than entertaining and the teppan prices are a bit high for the area and the quality. i would say the teppan was average, as was the entire experience on all 3 days. one other note: the beers on display on the shelf behind the bar aren't necessarily available. some are \\\"decor\\\" and not available for purchase, a major disappointment. don't show it to me if i can't have it!\\n\\ni'll return for the sushi, but i won't be dropping big bucks here.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Came here every morning for breakfast while staying at Mandalay Bay.

I ordered the combo banh mi with extra pate and a coffee to go.  The dining area is huge and there was quite a bit of people that day,  they effortlessly went through the line and I received my sandwich and coffee in less than 5 min.  We took it back to the hotel and I was impressed with the size and filling.  Not only was there a decent amount of meat for me, but quite a bit of pickled vegetables.  The crunch in the bread made polish off the entire sandwich(also just finishing working out helped).  The coffee was sweet and served as a dessert.

It was the first day of our honeymoon and we were hungry and didn't want to spend much, so we ventured into Red, White and Blue. \\n\\nWe were seated and the service was...okay. For as busy as the place was (it wasn't) I expected more than the slow service we got. Also, servers were huddled behind our table chatting with the bartenders which was pretty annoying. \\n\\nWe both had burgers which were good, but anywhere else would have cost us a third less than what we were charged. We ended up spending over $50 with tip for me and my husband, which was waaaaay more than we should have paid. \\n\\nWe left there saying that we should have checked the Yelp reviews and sure enough, when we returned to our room, we saw that we should have avoided the place!\\n\\nIf you're starving and staying at Mandalay and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, walk over to Luxor's buffet.

I'm no pro and I still have a lot to learn, but yoga is important to me and I'm experienced enough to write a review. It is the studio in Las Vegas that I prefer over the others because they have a lot of impressive talent and some classes that you can't find at any other studio in Las Vegas.\\n\\nI recently tried a Mysore class - I thought anything that makes you sore is probably a good workout. I had no idea it was an Asthanga practice group doing a set sequence and not a traditional class that is led by an instructor at the front of the room. Wow it was awesome! The teacher's name is Jennifer and she helped me understand the difference between Mysore and led classes - and the difference with a set sequence of poses. She gave me the attention I needed and started teaching me to memorize the sequence. Most of the poses I had done in flow classes, but Jennifer showed me the way they are supposed to be done and it made me work a lot harder and therefore the benefit to my body has been tremendous! \\n\\nAsthanga Mysore is harder than most of the classes I have attended anywhere, and it really challenges my mind and body. I forget some poses or get them out of order and Jennifer always reminds me and helps me in a way that makes me feel like I belong with people that blow my mind with what they can do in their practice. \\n\\nAs hard as it is for me to make the classes with my work schedule I have made it a top priority to go as much as I can. I would go every day if I could. Thanks Jennifer for being so knowledgable and providing rationale for everything you tell me that actually makes perfect sense!

I'm glad I did. We came here during a day trip to Madison for my fianc\\u00e9e's birthday/doctor's appointment/trip to pick up a turtle we're babysitting. It made a suitable birthday meal.\\n\\nThe regular buffet items were probably the best I've had at any Asian buffet I've been to. Everything seemed fresh and the options I chose were outstanding compared to other buffets I've been to. My only complaint is that the fried rice was a bit bland, but it's meant to be mixed in with the other foods so that's a minor gripe.\\n\\nMy stomach was a little bit uneasy all day (unrelated to and preceding coming here, totally not anything to do with the restaurant) so I took it easy on the sushi. The few pieces I had were good, although they weren't, in my opinion, on the same level as the rest of the food. For sushi, I'm definitely still more partial to Fushimi/Fushinami on Milwaukee's east side. That said, the sushi is endless and you're free to take as much or as little as you like. Too often with sushi buffets you're locked into a whole maki roll only to discover its not quite your thing; here, that's not going to happen. The sushi area seemed sanitary, and two guys were making the rolls fresh as I browsed.\\n\\nThe service was pretty friendly for a buffet. Often, at a buffet I feel like I'm being watched by the staff; here, it felt like the staff was present but not like I was being stared down. The woman waiting on us was attentive about clearing plates and bringing drink refills.\\n\\nFinally, the price: we did the lunch buffet. Honestly, for all-you-can-eat sushi...you really can't beat this price. $8.XX per person, plus a bit for the drinks. That's just unheard-of.\\n\\nEasily a 4/5. I plan to come back on some future trip to Madison, and I could easily see bumping it up to a 5/5.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Got there on a Tues night 10:30 pm no valet parking, long check-in line, employees standing around joking.

Booked Crowne Plaza on about 6 days' notice when just about every other hotel in the downtown area was no longer offering their military rate for the dates of my trip. They have free wireless, but no free breakfast.\\n\\nWe had a nice stay. We got a room with a king size bed and balcony. The balcony was nice--not a view of downtown, but still a nice enough view of part of the city. The room was pretty clean, but there was an overly deodorized smell (that went away once I left the sliding door to the balcony open for a while, since it was a nice day). Some of the curtains, the bedskirt, and the comforter had a few little stains, but nothing worth complaining over. The bathroom was very nice, with a nice shower head, but I was a little disappointed there was no fan. The TV was an old CRT 28 or 32\\\" that was clearly on its last legs, but that was OK too since we were there to sleep not watch TV.\\n\\nThe location is pretty good--in the government district across the street from the huge county courthouse. Seemed like a nice safe area--the manager even recommended a safe jogging route in the area that began and ended at the hotel. The walk to the shops and restaurants of downtown is at least 10-15 minutes, which wasn't bad, but they also have a free shuttle that takes you up to 3 miles from the hotel, which covers all of the downtown area.\\n\\nOverall, we had a pleasant stay. Nothing to write home about (except the nice balcony), but nothing to complain about either.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: As a successful business owner and woman, I was so excited to treat myself to a wonderful dinner here.

The lady was very helpful in her explanation, and I up telling her to give me whatever she liked best. The food itself was pretty good overall, I enjoyed some of the combinations a lot others.

In fact I have given up Thai restaurants in the Francisco area, since they rarely compare.  Sunday lunch brought me to a \\\"closed\\\" sign at Lotus  Luckily I used Yelp to find another Thai restaurant  I was amazed that Komol was so close to Lotus, surprised that it was open and ecstactic with the quality of the food and friendly service  This is an excellent choice forarians (60 of their business is the vegetarian dishes).  I enjoyed the pork panang, and to sampling the fish dishes on future and visits.  I agree with the comments on the spice level; use caution, especially on an visitn\\nMy only complaint is that Vegas has two restaurants within a hundred yards of other, when I cannot find comparable Thai food within a miles of my home.\n:\n\n: Finally made a reservation after of to try this place. Got there a little early and was seated away (what a plus, rarely happens). Water came right away. Service was great and atmosphere was pleasant. I planned on spending 150-200(without tip) on this dinner..Boy did I walk away happy and a little heavy in the pocket bookn\\nGetting right to it, I ordered the broiledfish with truffle fries. My gf orderedlops with macia nuts and citrus. We ordered a salad, spinach sauteed in garlic andots, anduffle mac cheese. Wow! Meals were surprisingly plentiful and looked great. Myfish was excellent (firm yetulent) and the fries were surprisingly good and plentiful. Thelops were good, I've better but there were about 6/7 large sized which is unusual. The mac cheese was so tasty (asiago, parm, w/truffles).ach was excellent. Well prepared not tooy or oniony(such words) idk...but nonetheless, greatn\\nI broke and ordered dessert (the waiter advised us in the beginning that its takes 15 min). Came out on fire, literally..A pineapple down cake with rum (i think), cream, and a divine caramel sauce! OMG..the other table was gking over the setting. It was incredible, a must try!\\nOverall, this was a great place. Unentious, elegant yet casual enough..I WILL be back..Oh yeah, 100 bucks including two of 7 Merlot that was easy the palate!\n:\n\n: I like this place because it is one of the few places that servely coffee. It of a cafe in Rome. Located in the Cosopolitan, it is convenient place to get your coffee and food to go. Also, they have quick eats here like sandwiches, salads, and pastries. The place't have a table, but can stand and get a quick bite. There is no better place for your coffee than Va Bene.\n:\n\n: Panda Express, I wish I could you! Especially after Ily keep back to this location. The staff here can't multi-task. When they try to, that when people's food starts to get up and down and around. Let's on one person time. That's great that you to help 10 people at time but again the staff't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you like a 3 itemree. *slowinks* He's way too fled.n\\nYou guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly to you for the third item like 5 times?n\\nThe last I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take order.  Eventually something clicked up there that paying customers were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting to get service. OMG\n:\n\n: I have been to Oggi's many many many times. The food has been great, the service is always helpful and accommodating but the beer is better. You come to a pizza and beer place for that but they you more. Enjoy:\n\n: Cleveroi is located on this cool little stretch of Central Avenue in the same area as Central Wine Bar.  The decor is beautiful and well done, the staff is friendly and the food and drinks are quite good  We tried the corn dog bites, theame fters and the wood fired grilled plate for our entrees  It was all pretty good, but nothing to rush back for, the drinks were tasty and well mixed - I recommend the Marvin Gardens...yummyn\\nI will definitely back for hour and hope the menu might get changed up a little bit.\n:\n\n: Service is bad, bad bad. Although the food is okay portion, the staff there brings this rating down.n\\nI was there during a lunch rush, although it't completely slammed, a female server was heard yelling from the kitchen about how SHE IS F******ING!!!! Crickets after that and everyone in the dining area turned that direction in complete shock.\\n from this little,  you can't get seated, order you meal, get your check and pay in a timely fashion at all. I almost left exact change when I got my bill, but decided tip lite anyway.n\\nFood is full of grease, just about everything on their menu is fried. What a disappointment.n\\nI't be back and I hope for the of this place they will consider hiring staff with some service skills.n\\nOh and WTF, FOX news is the only news network they show!\n:\n\n: I came here on Monday to celebrate Day. My brother recommended place. We went during hour, nice hour selection! A of rolls choose  from. I also liked the Hawaiian fusion they had to their food., maybe it was the day, but I thought the fish could beenher. I also ordered the fish tacos which were good but  I was not expecting to be fried., I would also suggest adding fish tacos that not have fried fish to menu: neutral\n\n: So Opa Life has taken over the space formally by My Greek Express as apparently the parent company ofpa Life bought out MBGE per my with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store\\nThe first thing I noticed here was that they did a really job the old space that wasy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing\\nSadly the noticed was the sticker shock of this place toGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up board\\nI got the special was a combo deal of chickenita, drink and a side for $. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on theita it was pretty much red onion and tiki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked\\nThey just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it be hard to convince to come this way often.\n:\n\n: I almost to only give 1 start in hopes I can get seated faster, but that is my only complaint which means you are doing the simple things to perfection. Finally got to bring my girlfriend here on Saturday 8/10/13, arrived 7pm, told a 30 wait, not bad in my opinion. We moved the car closer, then just to head down to the Waterfront to waste time.  later my cell rang and we were seated. Now the wait for food was much longer that I would have liked, but it was worth every second! I't even know to start. I ordered theet, ribs and chicken apple tacos, she the chicken and theet and we shared the jaleno appleaw and of course the mac cheese. We wanted to try theizo but they were out. (just an excuse to back and fuel my new addiction). The next time we will be getting our own cheese that's sure! I cannot say what taco was best because all so good and unique in own way. Experiment with their sauces as well. I got the Smoke 3 pepper and theicotero, without any sauce and then trying one of the other completely the flavor profile in to something new, each bite incrediblen\\nThe place and the menu are very simple, but the real star the food! KEEP IT WAY! Never outn\\nAlso, the staff was amazing, each one helping the other out, no one went without attention\\n\\nI will be there often Smoke, you for a new \\\"iction\"\n:\n\n: We eat here for breakfast every we in Vegas. On our last trip (923/10 //10 we decided we try another place to the strip and it only us appreciate the S Cafe more!

Certainly, I ate my fill of crisp wonton strips, fried rice, egg, stirried vegetables, and the inevitable sweet sour pork. I avoided the fried chicken and the fries, and't regret my choice. I tried the mein noodles but't for more. Ied the of lemon chicken, a favorite mine from I came here over  ago\\n the price? $7 and for your fill of Chinese food and a drink is pretty reasonable by any standard, even if the selection't much to at and the food itself't stand out either. Service is kept minimum - your money (cash only please!) is taken as you enter and water and/or a soda choice is brought to a table chosen you you load up your plate. Empty are taken away regularly, and food isished periodically from behind the mysterious doors where it like a of is happeningn\\nWas it theience of a cash-only business with a single room for seating, the of the cooking behind the scenes nearly by the of someone watching their Chinese film on a portable player behind the counter? The worn tables and plastic plates that look just as they did  ago, shaped like alien faces from the classic 0's of'Worlds'n\\nThe is that it was of things. Mike Kwan's Coin is neither great nor terrible. The selection is limited, the food only fair (though I love thoseonps!), the service is minimal, and the is. But Coin remains today mostly like was 20 ago, the worn and the alien-face plates. Walking in and smelling the food is a strong of nostalgia, and remains a consistent experience in a world with change.\n:\n\n: Do not visit the GOLD LOGE for OPEN BaR!!!!!

Unfortunately, I was made to feel so very sub-par to the other men in the restaurant... I was celebrating a successful day, and almost cried because of how I was treated by my waiter!

We made reservations for 6:45 PM and were seated next to a table of 20 people with screaming kids (I am as mad with myself for not asking for another table as I am with the airhead hostess for seating us there). Given that there were more employees at the restaurant than patrons, I don't understand why the service was so poor. \\n\\nWhen we sat down they did the usual up-sell on bottled water (attention all restaurants -- this is getting ANNOYING) and we asked for \\\"tap water\\\" and I ordered a prickly pear frozen Margarita no salt. What arrived was a Margarita WITH salt. Given there was straw I went ahead and started drinking it, but within 60 seconds the waiter came to prepare the \\\"table side guacamole\\\" and he asked me if I liked the drink and I said it was OK but they went ahead and put salt on it. His response? \\\"OK\\\" ... note to management, when either your bartender or waitstaff screw up should they not try to make amends? \\n\\nGiven that I've had \\\"table side guacamole\\\" at much cheaper places, like El Torito Grill, I expected something more than bringing a bowl with all the ingredients and the waiter standing there mixing them --- no explanation of WHAT the ingredients were or if we wanted this or that in the guacamole --- so why say \\\"table side\\\" when it might as well have been done in the kitchen? And to top it off I had to ask the waiter about the two hot sauces; e.g. what were they, were they hot or mild, etc. The guacamole was OK, not the best and it was EXTREMELY salty. My guest and I couldn't figure out why. \\n\\nMy guest ordered the Filet with Cheese enchiladas and I ordered the \\\"tres tacos\\\". My tacos were probably an appetizer but I wasn't that hungry and quite honestly nothing on the menu looked that great. They also had an all-you-can-eat buffet for $29 but to my guest and myself it looked like a glorified taco bar (with a nasty looking roasted whole suckling pig in the middle -- I'm sorry, when I see something that could possibly be someones pet roasted whole on a platter it doesn't make my mouth water). \\n\\nMy three tacos were one pork which was so hot I had to take a Pepcid AC after the meal, a chicken taco that was quite good and a steak carnitas taco that was smothered in the sweetest tasting BBQ sauce I've ever had --- that one I skipped after the first bite. \\n\\nIn the meantime, table with all the brats (why do parents allow this?) kept getting louder, my guest's steak and enchiladas came. He ordered the steak medium rare and what came was somewhere between medium well and well done. The waiter was actually standing behind me when I saw my guest cut the steak in half and looked in shock at how well done it was. Before I could say \\\"send it back NOW\\\" the waiter said, ohh, that looks well done to me. So he took it back but offered NOTHING given that I was done with my meal by the time the next steak came which was BLOODY RARE. My guest and I had headaches from the screaming children and just wanted to get the hell out of there so he ate most of the steak but left the most bloody rare pieces for the kitchen staff to see when the plates were returned to the kitchen. We waited forever for the check and the waiter didn't take anything off the bill or even offer a free desert. I left a 10% tip and will NEVER be back.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: We came here on a Friday about 4:30pm and there was no line!! I paid around $130.00 for 2 people because I figured it would be the same price as a steakhouse. (I found out later that the buffett was a bit more) If you are looking for steak you will disappointed like I was. I assumed that steak would be an option because of the pricing of the buffett but I was wrong. They had other choices like lamb, prime rib and chicken. You can get most of these choices at other buffets for much cheaper. \\n\\nI skipped over to the seafood which had Alaskan crab legs and rock crab claws. The Alaskan crab legs you can get at most Las Vegad buffets but the rock crab claws I haven't seen. The reason why I was dissatisfied is because they don't have crab claw crackers. I was told they had wooden mallots but I didn't want to go in that direction because we were seated too close to the other table. I didn't want to have crab shells flying all over the place so I just had the crab legs.\\n\\nI checked out the Asian station but I didn't find anything special. It was comparable to the Rampart Casino Buffett ( which isn't saying much). The dessert bar had no real stand out items for me.  They had gelato and an assortment of pastries. They do have fresh juices though but I didn't try any of them. \\n\\nIt is a good buffet but it is overpriced for what it is.

She had to go get help from another waitress when I ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Even the more fluent of the two didn't think to ask me what kind of whiskey, so I was served rail that tasted like the ice cubes had come from a moldy dispenser.\\n\\nThe food was ok. Nothing special. I had the kung pao chicken.

They were NOT ready for the 2nd seating and took almost 20 minutes to finally start getting everyone in and to their tables. \\n2. I ordered a very EXPENSIVE bottle of champagne and you would have thought the waiter would have taken care of us, but he pretty much ignored us. After he poured our champagne, he placed the champagne on the piano where ANYONE could have just poured themselves champagne from OUR BOTTLE. I had to ask him to get an ice bucket and move it NEXT to our table!!\\n3. The waiter took our order for appetizers  which was about 6 different options and he would bring them to us with sauces. He brought back our \\\"order\\\" but had lobster claws and only a couple of stone crab claws. I asked for what we ordered and he went back to get more. He came back with only 4 and said this was ALL they had they were out. OUT after only 30 minutes into service!!??\\n4. We ordered a Caesar Salad for 2 and when they brought it we tried it and you could tell it was pre prepared as the lettuce was soggy and the salad was over dressed!\\n5 Dinner came and at least our steaks came out great.\\n6.

I have traveled around the world to some of the finest restaurants in major European cities and they know how to take care of their customers where you want to come back. Dominick's is arrogant and thinks they are the be all, end all. Guess what, you're NOT all that!! Restaurants are driven by customers and how you treat your customers will determine how well you will do. Unless you FIX your problems, not only will you fail for next New Years, but I can't see you being in business for long. In this economy restaurants are NOT a necessity and people will go where they are taken care of, as well as for the food. You're NOT cutting it with your customer service and for your sake, you need to take a good long look at how you're mistreating customers and change it.

The sad truth is that, over the past 6 months to a year, Water Wings has gone downhill dramatically and drastically. My kids no longer swim at Water Wings for several reasons, but my chief concern was many new and inexperienced swim teachers that simply put, do not know how to effectively teach children to swim. Unfortunately, most of the seasoned instructors from years past either no longer work with the company or have moved to California to work at the newest location. I paid for private lessons (not cheap) and in many classes the primary instructor was busy \\\"training\\\" a new instructor or chatting with a colleague. I understand training is necessary but it shouldn't take away or undermine the meat of the lesson, especially considering the cost and limited time allotment.\\n\\nAs a parent one of my main concerns - besides the instructors' inexperience - is the lack of accountability for children's safety. Employees are neither background checked nor drug tested, which in my opinion, is unacceptable when staff is in direct contact with children. (Not only, but you are quite literally putting your children's lives in their hands when you hand them over in a pool.) Additionally, the pool and facility is often dirty and unsanitary. This became more apparent to me after switching my kids to swim at another facility. There have been many incidents over the years (dirty play area, grimy shower area, floating grossness in the pool) but the one that stands out to me was when an individual had vomited in the locker room. I notified the staff and instead of properly cleaning it up, they had sprayed it repeatedly with a noxious cleaner (but did not wipe or clean the area). Eww. \\n\\nThe front desk staff is hit or miss. Some of them are super sweet and accommodating and some are rude and standoffish. As though they are better than you. Interesting. I've overheard them gossiping about their colleagues and other friends and even clients! Talking sh*t about your clients - and their kids - is not the best idea and is certainly unprofessional. I could go into more details but I think you get the point. \\n\\nMoral of the story is - I would have recommended years ago hands down. Today I would caution to stay away.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I was referred here by my cousin who ranted and raved about how amazing Dr. Gondi is.

It was pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with the fries or onion rings. Fries were soggy and onion rings were the kind when you bite into it the onion easily comes out.  Not impressed. \\n\\nOne co-worker ordered a bacon cheese burger and cheese fries. She had ordered the cheese fries before and it had originally had cheese sauce over the fries. This time it just had melted cheddar over the top and they were definitely not as good. Consistency is very important as if she had known it was just going to be melted cheddar she wouldn't have ordered them.  Her burger was pretty good and it was very big.  \\n\\nThe next co-worker ordered a chicken Philly sandwich and it was terrible. All bread and grilled onions. The chicken had no flavor and did not look like all white meat. She cut each bread slice in half and had enough bread/onions to make a complete other sandwich. She was really disappointed that it was so terrible. She took a few bites but she couldn't even finish it. \\nAnother co-worker ordered the BLT and fries.  The BLT was good but the fries were too soggy again.\\n\\nAll in all this place is ok for burgers/patty melts/BLT but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. Becuase you can find a better burger for cheaper at a wide variety of other places. \\n\\nMost importantly I expect consistency when I go to a place. It's so frustrating to order something and get it one way one time and a different way the next.\\n\\nEven with the limited choices that we have for lunch near the office I doubt we'll be back.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: If you can afford to, I recommend you stay at the Caesars; they've really got this whole Vegas luxury and no need to leave the property thing down. \\n\\nI was set up here for a few days while attending a trade show.

Sure you walk a mile every day if you go from end to end, but who cares. You can shop without going outside, eat varying cuisines at the buffet or at their other restaurants or you can people watch at the casino. \\n\\nHaving stayed at other hotels on the strip I'd really like to be able to come back here again, but like I said, it's a matter of affording it.

A decently priced ($6-7 per meal) breakfast option in downtown Pittsburgh.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Water, Water, Water-loo, loo, loo!!!!!\\n\\nMy how you have changed from my \\\"studious\\\" days as a WLU undergrad. The fine dining landscape has certainly improved in little over 4 years (or 5...my oh my I'm ageing at a rapid rate). However, with age comes an appreciation for the finer things in life such as good food, good wine, good company, etc. So I guess this is why my overall experience at The Bauer Kitchen was so amazing!\\n\\nThis place impressed me from the moment we walked in. The d\\u00e9cor was beautifully elegant while maintaining a certain rugged appeal. Dark stained wood tables paired with Ostrich skin covered seats made for a unique combination going with the overall stylish and sophisticated ambience. But don't be scared off by my description, you don't need to wear a members jacket to dine here. The Bauer is still trendy enough for jeans and a t-shirt. Lets call it casual fine dining\\n\\nThe menu was a welcome surprise as well. Catering to every taste it was very eclectic. The one thing I liked best is while maintaining certain fine dining staples, the Bauer had found was at making simple foods such as Pizza and Burgers, just this side of classy, using premium ingredients and cooking process. Yumm!\\n\\nI decided to start my meal with a pint of Mill Street Organic (always a automatic +1 star for any establishment who carries my fav beer on tap). \\n\\nFor my appetizer I had what was referred to as a Romaine salad. It was like a Caesar salad BUT with a freshly made garlic dressing, fresh croutons AND the best part being the slow cooked smoked strips of bacon which tasted the way a camp-fire smells. ..... Just drooled in my mouth a little (sorry)\\n\\nMoving on, for my main course I decided to call this restaurant out on the fine portion of their \\\"fine dining\\\" claim, and ordered their Duck Confit. I asked the waiter for his honest opinion of the dish and he said it was wildly popular and told me to it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. SOLD GAR\\u00c7ON!!\\n\\nThe duck was served exactly as promised, deliciously crispy and moist. It was served with mixed veggies, steamed and grilled, and fingerling potatoes seasoned and cooked to soft perfection.\\n\\nAll of my waiters recommendations were spot on for dinner and his service was impeccable. He even made a great after dinner shot suggestion when we asked for tequila. For any of you who have never tried Cabo Wabo tequila, do it! Perfect after dinner shot to help you digest (or make you forget you are full), smooth and actually tasty :)\\n\\nThis experience came with an expected price tag of about $60-70 per person, which I can justify for fine dining. However, if you are looking for a cheap meal I recommend you try one of the other fine establishments on King St. But if you have the extra bucks, hit The Bauer Kitchen up, well worth it.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I was really excited to try this restaurant for breakfast, but I walked away disappointed. It's mediocre (at best) food. From the orange drink to potatoes that come from a box (I saw the box in the kitchen), this place has disappointment written all over it. While it's super cheap, I'd skip Lindos and instead head to your closest Eat n' Park.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: To it's menu, vibe, and intense decor, this place is all about beef. Suggest not coming here if you are a vegetarian. Despite this joint's, perhaps overly passionate cow obsession, kyloe served me one of the best steaks I've ever had. It's not a place to come to if you are starving and want a huge chunk of meat, but it is a wonderfully tasty dinner filled with various flavors as there is a variety of cuts, rubs, marinades, and sides to choose from. Although our meal was a wee bit pricy, the food did, by no means disappoint, and I'm proud to say my short horn sirloin was awesome. Suggest coming here if you are visiting Edinburgh.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Front of the house doesn't have a clue.  Walked out on my second visit, room wasn't half full, waited 15 minutes for water.  Back of the house so-so at best.  Marsala must come out of a jar, seriously.  French dip just okay.  Less than a mile away, Bernard's Bistro & Luna Rosa are most excellent!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I definitely enjoyed the shepherds pie poutine and thought MAN, why have I never eaten this before, or cooked it every brutal Montreal winter of my life? I also loved the smoked meat poutine and discovered that mustard is a more friendly flavour than I had previously recognized.  The young couple from Trois Rivere behind this new poutinerie on the hallowed ground of the old Roi Du Plateau are holding their own, and they seem super sweet and hard-working and I wish them the best. \\n\\nThe interior is a little cold and clinical feeling, but is very clean. The mayo options for the onion rings got me excited but then I didn't love them, or at least not with the heavy (and possibly artificial) citrus flavouring on the rings. The chop poutine is apparently popular but I am squeemish about chicken in fast food contexts and the texture on this one didn't do it for me - felt either processed or slightly undercooked for my liking. \\n\\nThe joint is new and super well intentioned and there are some excellent nosh options on the menu, especially for late nights. Marie-Pier's idea that they get a BYO license is genius, this would have me coming back with various beers all the time to cuddle up with a big red bowl of the shepherds pie. Also, I heard they are getting couches - smooth moves. I think some comf, some softer light, and a focus on high quality ingredients (even if it means slightly narrowing the vast menu) will help this Trois Rivere import thrive here in Montreal. Le Roi est mort. Vive le Roi.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Love this place.  Great staff and can always find a good conversation if you hang around to enjoy your purchase.  Everyone I've met there goes out of their way to be inclusive and welcome, which is pretty unique as far as I've experienced.\\n\\nThe one occasion I've had a less than stellar purchase, Nikki went out of his way to make things right.  That, as well as their great selection has earned them a regular customer.\\n\\nThe parking is a bit spotty at the moment, but should be better in a few weeks (I recommend parking in the north lot off Camelback until November).  Pretty good eats nearby as well, and good places to grab some snacks or beverages before heading to enjoy a good smoke.\\n\\nCan't recommend Baxter's enough!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: it really depends on whos working, when the older ppl are its better. All I know is I was really disturbed by the blond girl making our food who had a shirt 3 sizes to small so her stomach was showing (is the mandatory now a days?)

And ya she was like \\\"I'll text u later\\\", I almost thought she was talking to me but in fact she was looking thru me talking to him.

It's a great place fo karaoke (but they got rid of it - we hope they bring it back), to watch a game, or to get some wings.  \\n\\nThe wings are probably the highlight of the menu.  Bigham has at least 20 different flavors of chicken wings.  The wings are always very nicely done, and are of decent size.  I've never experienced them overcooked or poorly done.  They're definitely some of the best wings I've ever had in Pittsburgh!\\n\\nI recently also had a Pittsburgh salad (minus the fries) with grilled chicken - the restaurant offers that you can get any of your toppings (chicken, steak, et al.) tossed in any of their numerous wing sauces.  I ordered the grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and it was really tasty.  The chicken was nicely done, it was tender and juicy and falling apart.  The rest of salad was comprised of very fresh ingredients.  \\n\\nThe only reason I'm not giving Bigham 4 stars - because the food is pretty good for a divey bar - is because their service is pretty inconsistent.  Some nights it's kind of poor and other nights it's good!  It's a mixed bag.  Basically, it is one of my favorite neighborhood spots and offers people a nice change from Shiloh Grill and Redbeard's.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Sunbum here with Jill eating the sea urchin.

The pork is chopped extremely fine (maybe by a food processor?) not pulled pork by any means. My husband and I both thought the potato salad tasted like it had to be store bought and the baked beans tasted like canned beans with ketchup added. We smoke at home and have had lots of great bbq and this was okay but we felt led astray by the high star rating on Yelp. We wouldn't go back.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Taylor is a stellar employee who I witnessed getting verbally abused by an arrogant pompous manager.

They will try and scam you and get you to sign a 45yr agreement (think about how long 45 yrs is). You will lose thousands of $$$ on a horrible service that you will probably never be able to use.

If you are not a Geek, you won't understand why I gave five stars for this review.\\n\\nAt your first time, you won't be sure of your choice. The external door will lead you into a basement, but this is where the experience begins: on the left, you'll see custom arcades done with Xbox consoles. Yes, that means you can take your preferred drink, and play some Xbox games... with joysticks.\\n\\nOn the right side, the tables, sofas, and chairs. On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evening, you'll see a lot of people playing board games on these. They are also computers friendly, as you can go there, and work for a couple of hours with a free Wifi connection that work (non usual for coffee shop, but they understand the importance of this for us, the Geeks), and enough power outlets.\\n\\nThey have a lot of choices for drinks: coffees, bubble teas, soft drinks, beers... They also have some snacks like hot dogs, nachos, peanut butter dumpling, desserts, and more. You'll also like the Geeky decorations: picture frames of Star Wars, Futurama, and much more.\\n\\nLet me finish this review by talking about the two owners: you can always see one of them in the place. They are so friendly, and they really care about their customers. They are also big fans of helping the promotion of the Geek culture.\\n\\nSo at the end, a very nice venue to hang out with friends, work on your computer, play board games, challenge your friend with Xbox games, or just sit down, and relax in a Geeky environment. The numbers of regulars will attest the experience you can get at Fonzoo.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Food was so-so. Carne Asada burrito I ordered came with beans which I wasn't expecting.

Staff was pleasant to interact with, just the way they were trained to do by corporate or the branch manager.\\n\\nPlenty of parking spaces whenever I am here.  So I would say this is a good branch for customers that mainly utilizes ATM to conduct their WF transactions, with the occasional in-branch visit.\\n\\nGetting out of the parking lot to head North on Jones can be a pain, if you are there during peak traffic hours.  In which case try to use the center turning lane, and Frogger your way over as needed. Just be careful of north-bound vehicles that want to turn left onto Spring Mountain Rd.

What I did not expect was way overcooked tamales, cheese enchiladas that were somehow actually bad.  Beef tacos that were inedible.\\n\\nMy shredded beef enchilada was decent.

The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away, I'd be here multiple times a week. \\nI stopped back to Groceria Italiana after a food tour in Bloomfield a few weeks ago to pick up a few things for dinner. I decided to purchase the special- sausage ravioli because the owner had informed us that everything is made in house. Even the suasage is ground and tested in house before putting into the ravioli. I also left with marinara sauce and pepperoni bread. \\nThe pepperoni bread was light, fluffy and delicious. \\nThe ravioli is easily the best ravioli I have ever had. Each little pocket of heaven was hand made and was slightly different in shape and size from each other. The tall tale sign that they were pressed by hand.

I travel to Phoenix several times a year and I always saw the place on my way to the rental car return. There are always lots of cars going through and while I waited for my order I noticed tons of cars rolling through. These are usually good signs for an eating establishment.\\n\\nImagine my disappointment when I realized that folks in Phoenix don't know what fish and chips are. I was expecting real fish and chips, not some odd square facsimile of fish. Fish filets are NOT square. If i had wanted this I could have just gone to Long J. Silvers or Captian D's. I'm not saying I'm a fish and chips aficionado but I've eaten fish and chips all over the country and this is NOT fish and chips. Go have some fish and chips in New England (anywhere in NE) and you'll find out what fish and chips should be.\\n\\n I'll admit that the sauce is good and if I had some real fish and chips to dip it in, I'd enjoy it even more. I can only chalk this up to a regional thing but I'll definitely give this place a pass the next time I'm in Phoenix.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: ER Nurse: \\\"So what happened\\\"?\\n#1 Son:   \\\"Dad took a header\\\".\\n\\nWhat actually happened was we went on a hike and #1 son tripped. Dad (that would be me) was following too closely, tripped over #1 son and dislocated two toes, broke one of them and got some nasty trail-rash on his left forearm. #1 son - a small scratch on his hand.  \\n\\nUnfortunately I came to the ER around the same time as a number of other people who were much worse off than I was.  While I didn't like waiting I was also happy that my injuries didn't warrant a higher place in line.  Everyone from the woman who checked me in, the admitting nurse, the ER nurses, the medical assistant, the xray tech, the PA who made my toes straight again and the doctor who popped in to say hi were very professional, caring and friendly.  They even went out of their way to amuse my two sons who were bored beyond tears.\\n\\nNot a good day but if it had to end in an ER, I'm glad it was this one.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Been here 3 times. I love the ambiance, the best. Like it better than Town Square,  its more cozy, stores are closer together, bettter place to walk during summer Vegas heat.

Lotus of siam, you disappoint me.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Yay, Sephora! So I can blow my budget not on liquor or gambling but on makeup! I also picked up a really great swim cover up from Bikini Bay. One of my friends got a pair of Steve Madden flats for $10 on clearance, so it wasn't a complete waste of a mall. I just wish there was a Nordstrom so I could buy my exclusive mascara, oh well. Those kiosk workers are super annoying and Nestle overwhelmingly smells like cookies when you walk by (that's how they get drunk people!) My favorite part is that we could walk partly through the air conditioning to get to other casinos instead of completely walking outside, it's a big deal when it's 110 out!\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: While the company was awesome the food and service was far less memorable. The servers were uptight and stilted. The brunch fair was quite limited and while prepared with a chef's flare lacked that breakfasty feel you look for with brunch.

I have yet to try brunch, but hopefully I'll be able to update this review in the near future with that information!\\n\\nThis is my go-to spot for a romatic dinner with the wife.  This place is perfect for anything romantic...from a first date, to a 50th anniversary dinner.  Its a place that truly transcends time and generational gaps, both in ambiance and style of cusine.  \\n\\nIn case you were confused by the last sentence above, I mean that the menu and amibance aren't trendy and contemporary enough to scare off grandma and grandpa, and yet not old-fashioned and stuck up enough to scare off the youngins!  It a perfect balance of old meets new.\\n\\nService here is prompt and unassuming.  I've never gone wanting for a thing at my table during the numerous visits I've made, and yet have never been bothered by a servers overbearing presence.  Another reason it's great for a quiet, romantic dinner.  If I want to be entertained by my server, I'll go to Ru Sans.  Those guys are friggin hilarious; just not conducive to a quiet dinner conversation.\\n\\nI highly recommend the Lemon Goat salad, and the Duck Breast with grapefruit reduction.  My wife can do a salad and crab cake appetizer here and be thoroughly full.  As for the \\\"smokey collards\\\" that comes with the crabcakes...my wife rarely gets to enjoy any, because I'm usually scraping them off her plate and onto mine before the server can set our plates down.  I'm a sucker for good ol' fashioned pork bone soaked collard greens, and this place does not disappoint.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: went last nite to see the great george jones... first stop the will call window for my tickets i gave the guy my credit card  and drivers lic. he handed me 2 tickets and off we went i new i had ordered a isle seat and down near the stage when we were pointed to our seats they were up from the stage and in the middle........i told one of the ushers and he summond a manager/head usher i told him the situation and he took my name and said he would be right back he returned a few minutes later with the right tickets and apoligized..........great service.........when we did get the right seats we were behind the band........ my wife said oh great were behind the band then he informed us the stage rotates........cool...........great show......great venue... highly recomended   ALSO HAVE THER OWN PARKING LOT VERY CONVIENT PARKING....IN AND OUT\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: This place has changed over the years or do they not serve good food unless its the weekend.\\n\\nWe came on a Monday with a large group for dim sum. The shui Mai was ok. The dumplings were ok. The pork ribs were ok. The rice congee was ok. The steamed shrimp with rice noodles were day old that were warmed up with watered down soy sauce. It was gross. The chicken feet were cooked in a vinegar sauce and that was awful. The shrimp ball was old tasting too.\\n\\nThey use to be very good for dim sum but what happened?

Don't think I will return for dim sim here. :(\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I must say I've heard a lot of raving reviews from my friends when it comes to sushi so i came here with high expectations.  I also took a lot of cues from my friends and ordered the \\\"screaming orgasm\\\" and a bowl of french onion soup. \\n\\nThe soup was wonderful, served in a clay pot with plenty of onions and cheese, but the screaming orgasm left me a bit underwhelmed, especially for the price.  Maybe I'm too new to the sushi scene to make a judgement, but I remember having a similar dish at Sushi Fever which was a lot better and for a lower price.\\n\\nIt's not to say I wouldn't try it again, but I would definitely order something else.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Maybe some of my surprise came from not having been to any new Burger Kings of late, but I was really surprised when my husband and I went in to this location yesterday morning (we had a craving for fast food breakfast) and saw that it was all decked out in a Hollywood theme. It had sleek colored booths, framed pictures of movie stars, and get this - pendant lighting! Granted, pendant lighting has become as ubiquitous in restaurants as jukeboxes used to be, but it's still strange that fast food franchises have even jumped on the decor bandwagon. Anyway, the people working at this location are super-friendly, although the staff does tend to be more motivated when a location is relatively new (this one is about a year old), and the food we got was to be expected. I do love BK's French Toast Sticks for a nutrition-less but delicious Saturday morning breakfast, and my husband's sausage muffin was good (although he ordered it with egg and cheese and didn't get them). To sum it up, this is a good location as far as Burger Kings go, but in the end, it's just Burger King, which is never really all that great.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Great places, full of nice baristas\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Blessedly way off the Strip when you're in the mood for such things (um, frequently?), the biggest surprise is how uniformly excellent the beers are coming from a place whose name makes you think of frat boys brewing beer in water cooler bottles. A tasty IPA, a delicious roasty coffee hinting stout, a pale ale of near perfection, and no doubt everything they do is handled equally well. Runs a bit dark, and has a pleasant, friendly atmosphere that's a refreshing change from the general bleakness of the Chicago Brewing Company. Definitely worth a visit if you're up for hanging out and drinking good beer. And probably quite a few more visits after that. Cheers.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The place is closed, and out of business.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Good place to watch the game, have some bar eats and beers. Big patio with several TVs too. Went there recently to watch the Wisconsin game and after about 2 minutes we figured out the spot and the waitress was kind enough to change the the TV for us. Wasn't too busy, which was a nice change as some bars on game day just get ridiculously busy and it's hard to get good service. That said; it wasn't slow by all means, just a good crowd. \\n\\nOrdered the chicken nachos, which were OK. Came on separate tortilla chips with all the fixings. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but when I think of or want nachos, I want a stack of chips with the ingredients dumped on top, but that's just me. Had a bite of the wife's burger and it was good as well. Menu is full of special sandwiches and burgers as well as salads and apps. \\n\\nOnly negative was that the PBR was $2.50...now that's steep for a PBR, even knowing how much I love it.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Was there last night.  Pho was a 2.5 on a scale of 5.  I had the one that costs a little extra with meatballs, tripe, brisket. Generous amount of meat, but you know what they say, Pho is all about the broth.  That's what makes it.  Every pho is made from  beef broth even the chicken pho.  And that wouldn't be bad if the broth was flavorful. Da Vang's broth is a 5 out of 5 but I decided to compare.  I had the spicy, salty shrimp with shells on.  They were ok but I didn't realize I would be eating the shrimp's caca in the process.  My guest had beef with snow peas.  It was spiced to his liking but the flavor just wasn't there.  Their prices are incredibly low and that's why I gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one.  You get what you pay for.  Back to Da Vang for me!!!!!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Always clean, employees are always friendly. They sell everything from soda to hot dog buns to medicine.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Went for breakfast.  The firepit looks totally different in daytime.  Anyway, on to the eggs:  the biggest omelet I've ever seen.  And somehow they managed to make it taste delicious.  Great service.  Very affordable.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Took my wife and our 2 yr old to lunch today and it was horrible... I had the Chinese steak and she had the beef stew with rice, plus we ordered spicy duck tongue since it was on their chef special menu...\\n\\nBoth of our food were very salty, to the point that we were trying to scrap some of the sauces off so we can eat it.  The duck tongue, which was suppose to be spicy and hot, was barely warm(temperature wise) and had no flavor...  All I saw was a plate of bell peppers, onions, and maybe a couple of tongue in there.  This is a stir-fried dish, which should be coming out piping hot, and yet it was basically cold..\\n\\nWhen we got home later, let's just say their duck tongue won the battle and the war...\\n\\nCan we bring back the old Ah-Chung that used to be here? The decor might be worst but at least their food were edible\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I had really been looking forward to eating here and scheduled my birthday lunch here while we were in Vegas.\\n\\nThere were 4 of us and we were seated immediately for our 1pm reservation. I ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). My husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). I'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that I was going to order the spicy chicken with sweet potato hash. \\n\\nThe bread was really nice. I liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. It was spicy and yummy.\\n\\nWe ordered the queso fundido to start. It was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. YUMOLA!!!! This was delicious.\\n\\nOur entrees arrived and I cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. That's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. A solid white, runny yolk is the norm. The hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. They were clearly undercooked. My husband got the pork tenderloin sandwich and we were surprised to see it came cold.  I took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. Our 2 other companions enjoyed their Mesa Burgers.\\n\\nI sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. A manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. I cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  But the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  Why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? I can do it and I can't cook worth shite.  So, the manager came back to ask how it was and I told him I've been waiting months to come here and I'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. So he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. Nice, but not what I wanted for my birthday lunch.\\n\\nEven though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. We looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  Disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I've alway wanted to try this since my friend told me about it ever since it opened. She recommend me the hot frozen sundae. She said its supposed to be hot but it's cold because of the ice cream and the hot chocolate. She couldn't really describe it to me until I try it. \\n\\nSo now I took my friend here since it was her birthday. Our service was nice but I could have better service at Ihop. We ordered just the appetizers and the hot frozen sundae. Few minutes later he gave us our desserts before our food came. We ask him we wanted the desserts last after our meal. So he took it back. The place wasn't busy as I thought it would be. When our meal came. The nachos and the onion ring was good. As I said I could have better. When we were done with the meal, our desserts came and when we tried it. It wasn't hot as they describe it to be. It was very disappointment. After it was recommend. I won't wanna go back here again.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: We have been living at the Verona property for almost a year.

I ordered the Alaskan rolls, Boston rolls, and the California rolls. Holy cow-SO GOOD! All of the ingredients were fresh and full of flavor. I sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs gave us a ceviche dip, which was deliciously tangy and complimented the Boston rolls perfectly. I absolutely LOVED this restaurant's happy hour and I will definitely be back for the delicious food.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I clearly have a different opinion of this place compared to other reviews. this was my second visit here. the first being a few years ago. \\nI do not even know where to begin. \\nThe place is wall to wall people. So crammed on top of one another. It is so loud you cannot hear what the other people at your table are saying. The tables are not big enough for the amount of people they seat at them. We were 6 people squished in a table which was meant for 4.\\nOur server may have been new so I will try to cut him some slack. but he did get alot of our order wrong. Our drinks were mixed up, it took forever to get our appetizers, the entrees came pretty quickly. but one was wrong. The dessert was the worst part. My sister brought in a cake for my nephews birthday, and it took nearly an hour before it arrived. By this point we asked that it be put back in the box to take home. \\nThe food was not good. There are so many better options for Italian food. Real Italian food. To me this is on the same level of Olive Garden.

The restaurant was clean, service was nice and food was tasty so... what was the problem?  Well, the chicken in our dishes was a lil tough and when we ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai... though the flavor was great, there was literally only 2 shrimp on it.  With the 3 of us, that wasn't even 1 shrimp each.

A tasty IPA, a deliciousasty coffee hinting stout, a pale ale of near perfection, and no doubt everything they do is handled equally well. Runs a bit dark, and has a pleasant, friendly atmosphere that's a refreshing change from the general bleakness of the Chicago Brewing Company. Definitely worth a visit you're up for hanging out and drinking good beer. And probably quite a few more visits that. Cheers.\n:\n\n: The place is closed, and out of business.\n:\n\n: Good place to watch the game, have some bar eats and beers. Big patio with several TVs too. Went there recently to watch the Wisconsin game and after about 2 minutes we figured out the spot and the waitress was kind to change the the TV for us.

That said; it't slow by means, just a good crowd.n\\nOrdered the chickenos, which were OK. Came on separate tortilla chips with all the fixings.'t get wrong, it was good, but when I think of or wantos, I want a of chips with the ingredients dumped on top, but that's just me.

Everyo is made from  beef broth even the chickeno.  And that't be bad if the broth was flavorful. Da Vang's broth is a 5 5 but I to compare.  I had the spicy, salty shrimp with shells on.  They were ok but I't realize I would be eating the shrimp's caca in the process.  My guest had beef with snow peas  It was spiced to his liking but the flavor just't there.  Their prices are incredibly low and that's why I gave them an extra star otherwise it would be a one.  You get for.  toang for me!!!!!\n:\n\n: Always clean, employees are always friendly.

At first I had my doubts, cause I was suppose to be in bed, due to working the graveyard shift.  But, I promised her I would go, and try out something new.  I'm glad I did.  \\n\\nMax Brenner, located at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, is a chocolate filled extravaganza.  Its a good size place to eat, a good place to sit at the bar, or to walk by and get a snack.  It also has a second story, where you can have gatherings of any sort and I believe any size.  Well, according to Jocelyn, the sales & banquet manager, the upstairs gathering place, can fit up to 50, but with the Yelp Elite gathering, it was filled up with about 200 people.  So I'm sure they can probably reserve the place for more then 50 people.  \\n\\nNow, being there, has to be a nice feeling.  Not only for the fact that its a Yelp Elite gathering, but the Staff of Max Brenner made it special.  We had snacks, that were absolutely delicious, and loved the Chocolate Martini.  I felt overwhelmed with one of their waitress, Misti.  She made sure I had something to drink and went out of her way to make sure I had a drink.  Also it was great to meet Jocelyn, who was nice to come around and talk to us.  Despite how busy that night was, I was really impress with the service, the food and how friendly everyone was.  \\n\\nIf you're a chocolate lover, then Max Brenner is a place for you to check out.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: BEWARE: Snails at a French restaurant - escargot. How do you say ROACH???\\n\\nWent here for a group dinner on a Saturday night. It was the only steak place I could get a last minute reservation. Now I know why. Our group was seated and browsing the menu when we saw a roach crawling across the table. Being the girly girl that I am, I screamed EEEWWW and told my friend to kill it. Everyone in the dining room looked at us all snooty because of the ruckus we caused, but umm eeew roach! What would you like me to do quietly and calmly ask it to go away?! \\n\\nAnyhow, the waitress apologized and moved us to another table. We should have left, but being on a schedule and all, we reluctantly ordered our food. Our table had porterhouse steak, chicken, and a fish entree. Good size portions, some were seasoned ok while others were too salty. Overall, didn't hate it but didn't particularly like anything either. \\n\\nThe service of the staff was ok. The guy refilling our drinks and bringing our bread was on point.  However the waitress could have been more attentive given it was not crowded and she should be kissing our asses after the roach incident. The Manager never showed up at our table to apologize nor offer a discount. I probably should have complained but I don't know I just didn't. At a place like this I guess I felt like I shouldn't have to fish for a discount. I know at a \\\"dumpy\\\" chain restaurant like Claim Jumpers I'd have an apology and free something automatically. So, at $50+ per person for mediocre food, bad service, and a roach as an appetizer ...

We agreed on PF Changs as we both love Asian foods. Years back, I worked for Lucille's restaurant around the corner. During those days, I would frequent PF's because it was convenience. Since working there, I haven't been to PF's so I was excited to wine and dine!\\n\\nLocated in the District, once you exit the 215, turn down south on Green Valley, make the immediate right and you'll see PF Chang's. As a stand alone building, you have the luxury of private parking, but be advised, it isn't big. On busy nights, you'll have to park in the main district parking. Approaching the restaurant, you'll notice an outdoor seating area, left of the front doors. Once you enter, the main focal point is a hand painted Asian mural, which looked super cool and depicted some form of historic event. The main bar is located underneath the mural and most of the dining area is to the right. As we were seated, I noticed the mural continued throughout the dining room. There were other Asian artwork and Chinese statues solidifying the type of restaurant. The larger ceiling lights weren't as bright as you would expect and coupled with the dim red lighting on the outskirts of the dining room, it made for a great date night spot. For dinner, our server was super nice. She was accommodating and ensured our orders were correct. That's one thing I was appreciative of. She kept asking questions and I definitely felt our needs were being met. Now that's good service!\\n\\nFor dinner, I wanted to start with an adult like drink. I chose to go with the 2012 Estancia Pinot Grigio for $8 a glass. I actually liked this brand. I felt the wine was super crisp, with a fruity taste with a tangy/zesty type finish. I would recommend this wine again! For dinner, I decided to go with one of their signature appetizers, the Chang's chicken lettuce wraps for $8.95. As described on the menu, wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions and water chestnuts served over crispy rice sticks with lettuce cups. The chicken and mushrooms had the same texture so I'm super glad they chose the crunchy chestnut texture. The flavor was jam packed in the dish, kind of borderline salty. The rice sticks were good and crispy. I felt though, the oiliness of the sticks and the oil from the sauce was a little much. I was hoping for more of a health conscious dish, but there was a little too much oil to consider this dish healthy. I know, I know, I should have gone with a salad. I just wanted to try something else! \\n\\nAt the end of the day, my meal was definitely OK. There's no reason for me NOT to return. I think PF Chang's offers a lot of great dishes. This one was just not the best I've had, but I know I'll be back to check something else out in the near future.

The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years  which equals bland.  The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago.  But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups.  Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it.

So the last time I was in the immediate area, I decided to stop in, and of course, have my usual beer.  It was early evening, so it wasn't crowded, and we got right in. \\n\\nThe inside is very nice - a very comfortable feeling, dim lights, and dark wood. There were some tables with stuffed chairs, and booths along the wall, with the bar in the middle of the space. There didn't seem to be anyone to seat us, so we just sat at one of the tables.  Several minutes later, the hostess appeared and informed us that the table was reserved - but it wasn't for several hours, and since we were only going to have a drink, that there was no problem.\\n\\nThe menu was not extensive, but offered a number of different choices.  We decided to have a drink, and just relax for a while. Midway through our drinks, the hostess again appeared, and apparently the party that had reserved the table came early, and we were asked to move to a booth.  This wasn't a problem, and we agreed.  The hostess was very nice and professional, and comped us our first round.  \\n\\nAs Mabel's started filling up, I could tell it was more of a lounge than a restaurant. The customers were very diverse, of all ages, and although there was the usual Scottsdale players, it was a very laid back atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the main portion of our dinner is still missing in the kitchen somewhere, probably between the air conditioner that constantly dripped on my head and the screaming kids of one of the senior staff/owner. There comes a point where you have to cut your losses and just walk out on something you've lost your appetite for rather than drop some serious coin for a meal you've been waiting for over an hour and a half for and could no longer stomach.\\n\\nI'll be honest, what we had was good. Poutine side, really good. Endive salad, excellent. Duck pate appetizer, yummy. Their version of a whiskey sour was world class. Even the wine I was supposed to have with my entr\\u00e9e was an excellent choice, as it should be after breathing for so long. And I know it takes a long time to make good food - I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and they know how to time things out of a kitchen so that you don't lose your appetite. They also know how to own up to their mistakes. And they know how to properly set the atmosphere of a restaurant, something they have clearly lost touch with here.\\n\\nLet's start from the beginning. I tried to set a reservation through e-mail, which they said would be confirmed via a phone call. Never got the call. Yet when I finally called, they mysteriously confirmed the reservation via e-mail, yet I had never given it to them other than through the e-mail and in fact had reserved through another name. The only way they could have linked it up was via the phone numbers I gave, which matched.\\n\\nNext, the music in the restaurant is so loud, everybody has to scream at each other to be heard, driving up the noise level even more and the very knowledgeable waiter can't be heard describing virtually any of the specials. Normal table conversation is practically impossible. Add in the fact we were sat underneath the air conditioning vents which were set so cold they accumulated condensation that periodically dripped on top of my head or down my face. Except when they came by with a squeegee to mop the ceiling, which bought me a few more minutes peace. Then ramp up the noise level with two kids related to the staff who were either running around the restaurant, crashing dishes together, or crying at the top of their lungs while mom tried to comfort them when they clearly didn't want to be there, and we're on a downhill slide.\\n\\nDrinks arrived quickly, salads and appetizers seemed to be a bit slow, but hey, it's supposed to be quality, I can cut them some slack. Huge portions, you're advised to split everything unless you want a ton of doggie bag material, which is rather inconvenient if you aren't local. And then the wait started. Yes, the au pied de cochon takes 45 minutes, which they didn't warn us about, but an hour and a half after ordering it, it still hadn't arrived, I had lost my appetite for it, and my wife had had enough. We're were done. But apparently they weren't, as they proceeded to insult us by telling us it wasn't fast food and it took time to prepare. Yes, I know that, but when our waiter stopped making eye contact with us 45 minutes ago, perhaps you could have warned us that someone had screwed up and let us order something else rather than have it get worse and worse and worse. No, no, it's ready, stay, pay, and eat something you have no more stomach for, you ignorant American pigs. No apologies, nothing, but it practically took an Act of Parliament just to get our check so we could pay for what we ate and properly tip the staff, who had done no wrong.\\n\\nAs I said, I really looked forward to this, and my wife, who loves foie gras, had looked forward to it even more, but if Jon Taffer ever makes a series about successful restaurants who need a serious makeover because they've gotten too big a head, this should be at the top of his list.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Sometimes the difference between a three and a four star is a hard one.

I was hesitant to try this place...$35 for a full off Brazilian? Too good to be true! I later  scheduled my appointment and went in to find a cute little lobby with lots of fun zines for me to read. I was then taken into their wax room and left to freshen up- wipes readily available. I was fortunate enough to see Deanna. I gave her my wax history and she hers. We talked about the usual what do you do for a living...you know- anything to keep your mind off this pain for beauty process. Next thing I knew it was all over and Deanna lathered calming awesome lotion over the waxed area. Area btw was completely hairless and I was a happy camper! I paid my $35 + tip & scheduled my next!

The crab cake appetizer was perhaps the tastiest thing - no complaints there.  The BLT soup was a fun idea and decently executed but was underseasoned.  The same can be said for the chicken, prosciutto and rice.  It was underseasoned and the presentation was terrible.  It looked like it belonged in a death march in a high school cafeteria.  The flat iron steak was fantastic and tasted like filet mignon which was impressive but I wouldn't have minded a little salt.  The creme brulee was tasty enough but was served in two small aluminium tins.  It was rather sad looking.  \\n\\nRight before the start of each course, the chef would come out to explain the dish (which was good) and tell us how wonderful it is (which is bad - let me decide for myself please).  \\n\\nI suppose it was an okay value with the coupon but I certainly would have been upset if we'd paid full price.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Herb N' Legend is an awesome store.

Don't bother making an appointment!\\n\\nThe first time I went to Pink Polish was 3 weeks ago. I noticed that the (male) managers couldn't be bothered to express even an inkling of customer service. I was told (not asked) to sign in, and I got assigned a nail tech right away. She was sweet and did a FANTASTIC job--the best gel nails I've ever had. She made sure all the edges were cleaned up around my cuticles which is super important to me, as it leaves me no reason to pick at them and they last the full 10-14 days. While i was getting my mani, I overheard some techs lauging about one of the managers acting all suave. As if on command, he saddled up to me and complimented my yoga outfit and my nail color choice. I found it odd, but whatever. Just another flirt in a fedora. \\n\\nBut when I checked out, the managers were counting their profits at the front desk, and ran my card without looking at me or saying a WORD. I said please and thank you, and they remained completely silent, as if I wasn't even there. It made me think twice about returning, but my mani held up for a full 2 weeks so I figured I'd give them another shot.\\n\\nSo, about 2 weeks later, when my mom wanted to treat me to a mani-pedi a few days after I had an appendectomy, I suggested we go to PP.  I called at 10 am and made an appointment for us for 11:30. Again, no please or thank you on the phone. He said \\\"OK\\\" and hung up.\\n\\nWe arrived at 11:28 and there were about 5 girls who had walked in right in front of us without appointments. They were all tended to right away. The place was already packed (President's Day). We signed in and stood there waiting for the walk-ins to pick out their polish and to be seated at the nail bar or pedi chairs. \\n\\nFinally, a manager came back to the front desk. We told him we had appointments and he told (not asked) us to go sit in the far end of the lobby, as if we were in their way. He didn't seem to hear us say we had an appointment, so I repeated it nicely. He said, \\\"12:45 right?\\\" And i said, \\\"no, 11:30.\\\" (wtf? why would we come an hour and 15 minutes early to an appointment?!). It was now 11:40. Clearly he hadn't actually given us appointments at all when I called. This place is first come first served, without even the appearance of tending to those with appointments first. \\n\\nWe waited 10 more minutes until a manager finally told us to go sit down at the pedi chairs. The foot bath water was room temperature and felt gross. After a while, a tech came over to us and she seemed super stressed out. She asked me (but not my mom) to pick which pedi I wanted. I looked at the menu and selected \\\"basic pedi.\\\" She didn't seem to like this answer and barked, \\\"You decide!\\\" and left with no explanation. Apparently \\\"basic pedi\\\" would not allow her to reach her daily upsale quota. My mom and I stared at each other, totally shocked, and at the same time, we said, \\\"Let's go!\\\" It was now 11:50 and she didn't even have a nail tech yet.\\n\\nMy mom dried off her feet and then mine (I'm post-op disabled), and when we were leaving, my tech ran up, clearly upset that we were leaving. Like, scared for her life upset, and asked us to please go sit. My mom looked at the managers and said, \\\"We're leaving and aren't coming back. You guys are rude.\\\" The whole place heard us and the managers said nothing. \\n\\nWe then drove down the street and got our mani-pedis at a different, less fancy, less overpriced, much friendlier salon.   \\n\\nIt seems as if the managers are so obsessed with their profits that they think it's ok to treat customers like dog turds, and they work their employees into a panicked frenzy that borders on abuse. I don't blame the techs for any of this; they are sweet and work their fingers off. The managers seem like cocky slave drivers, and I refuse to support this business. I suggest you do the same. However, if you can tolerate the managers' complete lack of respect, and want to support their abusive treatment of workers, by all means, go ahead!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Eh.

The pho was extremely unimpressive, with a cheap tasting, salty broth that rendered my friend and me overly thirsty for the next twelve hours. The rare meat tasted as if it were \\\"improperly aged,\\\" as I like to term it, and was not fresh at all. Honestly, if it weren't for the dish's soft tripe, I would have given this place a one-star review. \\n\\nThe pork chop that my \\\"aunt\\\" ordered was greasy and dry at the same time. I didn't think that was possible. It seemed like it had been recooked twice over. \\n\\nTo add insult to injury, the basic tea was priced western-style at $1 per person. I'm sorry, but this place does not qualify as Asian due to that pricing structure. Tea is part of the dining experience at any formal Asian restaurant. \\n\\nThe service was cordial but average. \\n\\nAll of the above being said, if I were to give this restaurant some advice, it would be to remove that silly banner.

Everyone in the dining room looked at us all snooty because of the ruckus we caused, but umm eeew roach! What would you like me to do quietly and calmly ask it to go away?! \\n\\nAnyhow, the waitress apologized and moved us to another table. We should have left, but being on a schedule and all, we reluctantly ordered our food. Our table had porterhouse steak, chicken, and a fish entree. Good size portions, some were seasoned ok while others were too salty. Overall, didn't hate it but didn't particularly like anything either. \\n\\nThe service of the staff was ok. The guy refilling our drinks and bringing our bread was on point.  However the waitress could have been more attentive given it was not crowded and she should be kissing our asses after theach incident. The Manager never showed up at our table to apologize nor offer a discount. I probably should have complained but I don't know I just't. At a place like this I guess I felt like I't have to fish for a discount. I know at a \\\"dumpy\\\" chain restaurant like Claim Jumpers I'd have an apology and free something automatically.

They closed the location on indian school years ago, for the same reasons.  Those reasons are many now. I stopped back in after being away from Julio G's Take out.  Had 2 beef tacos and rice....  The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years  which equals bland.  The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago.  But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups.  Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it.  Bad news one person taking orders during lunch service in take out and service said orders.  Cleanup needs to be focused on here... They have forgotten to do this.

Unfortunately, the main portion of our dinner is still missing in the kitchen somewhere, probably between the air conditioner that constantly dripped on my head and the screaming kids of one of the senior staff/owner. There comes a point where you have to cut your losses and just walk out on something you've lost your appetite for rather than drop some serious coin for a meal you've been waiting for over an hour and a half for and could no longer stomach.\\n\\nI'll be honest, what we had was good. Poutine side, really good. Endive salad, excellent. Duck pate appetizer, yummy. Their of a whiskey sour was world class. Even the wine I was to have with my entr\\u00e9e was an excellent choice, as it should be after breathing for so long. And I know it takes a long time to make good food - I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world and they know how to time things out of a kitchen so that you don't lose your appetite. They also know how to own up to their mistakes. And they know how to properly set the atmosphere of a restaurant, something they have clearly lost touch with here\\nLet's start from the beginning. I tried to set a reservation through e-mail, which they said would be confirmed via a call. Never got the call. Yet when I finally called, theyiously confirmed the reservation via-mail, yet I had never given it to them other than through the e-mail and in fact had reserved through another name. The only way they could have linked it up was via the phone numbers I gave, which matched\\nNext, the music in the restaurant is so loud, everybody has to scream at other to be heard, driving up the noise level even more and the very knowledgeable waiter can't be heard describing virtually any of the specials. Normal table conversation is practically impossible. Add in the fact we were sat underneath the air conditioning vents which were set so cold they accumulated condensation that periodically dripped on top of my head or down my face. Except when they came by with a squeegee to mop the ceiling, which bought me a few more minutes peace. Then ramp up the noise level with two kids related to the staff who were either running around the restaurant, crashing dishes together, or crying at the of their lungs while mom tried to comfort them when they clearly didn't want to be there, and we're on a downhill sliden\\nDrinks arrived quickly, salads and appetizers seemed to be a bit slow, but hey, it's to be quality, I can cut them some slack. Huge portions, you're advised to split everything unless you want a ton of doggie bag material, which is rather inconvenient if you't local. And then the wait started. Yes, the au pied de cochon takes 45 minutes, which they't warn us about, but an hour and a half after ordering it, it still't arrived, I had lost my appetite for it, and my wife had had enough. We're were done. But apparently they't, as they to insult us by telling us it't fast food and it took time to prepare. Yes, I know that, but when our waiter stopped making eye contact with us 45 minutes ago, perhaps you could have warned us that someone had screwed up and let us order something else rather than have it get worse and worse and worse. No, no, it's ready, stay, pay, and eat something you have no more stomach for, you ignorant American pigs. No apologies, nothing, but it practically took an Act of Parliament just to get our check so we could pay for what we ate and properly tip the staff, who had done no wrongn\\nAs I said, I really to this, and my wife, who loves foie gras, had looked forward to it even more, but if Jon Taffer ever makes a series about successful restaurants who need a serious makeover because they've gotten too big a head, this should be at the of his list.\n: terrible\n\n: Sometimes the difference between a three and a four star is a hard one.

I bought a female yorkie puppy and found out that when I picked her up from the breeder that she already had ring worm. Dr. Gray was able to help us during this process, help our little girl and also treat our 2 year old yorkie boy as well- after her got it from her. She was very sweet to both our our dogs and extremely responsive when we needed more antibiotic spray and special shampoo to help the spreading. Needless to say she is the best vet we have had and I'm glad that when we moved her from WI we had made the right choice when choosing her. \\n  ***** Animal Medical Hospital also has a great puppy plan which helps making all the shots and health visits affordable. And to top that, Dr. Gray told us they price match, so we have been able to save about $50 so far in the last two visits by comparing prices online while waiting.  :)\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We hit up the Earl of Sandwich because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Yelp. Overall, however, the food was just okay.\\n\\nWe tried the Full Montagu since this was the most highly recommended sandwich of the lot.

Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!\\n\\nOk, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  They often have great specials, like the 4 course meal for $16.99, which includes soup, salad, entree, and dessert.  Oh, and the best part, unlimited Cheddar Bay BiscuitsI   RL also has some great lunch specials for when you want something smaller and cheaper.  Most of the lunch specials are $7.99, which is pretty good for some seafood.   I always feel like I got a great deal when the bill arrives for lunch or dinner.  \\n\\nThe menu is pretty big and quite diverse as well.  If you like shrimp, you are in luck because there always seems to be at least a dozen different types of shrimp.  They also have lots of other seafood options to suit everyone in your group.  Don't like seafood?  That's ok too, because they have steak, chicken, and beef options as well.  Everyone should be happy in your party.  If anything, everyone can just eat the unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Have I mentioned how amazing those suckers are yet? Yum!\\n\\nThe food over all is ok.  The dishes are ok.  Nothing is really special or outstanding, but it gets the job done.  The super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup.  It is super duper yummy and I think my favorite thing at RL.  It is a chain restaurant, so at least you always know what to expect, no matter which location you are at.\\n\\nI would normally give Red Lobster a 3 star rating because it is a-ok in my book, but I have to add a couple of stars due to my most recent visit.  I was with my mom, mother in law, and daughter after a fun night out.  When we first arrived, my daughter ran to the lobster tank, which is what she always does.  She loves to look at them and tell me all about them.  It was slow when we walked in and the host noticed how much she was en trailed with the lobsters.  He offered to let her pet one, which we totally went for.  He pulled out a bad boy and let us pet him.  I had to go first because everyone else was scared.  It turns out the rest of the ladies I was with are scared of lobsters.  Oh well, at least I can scratch \\\"Pet a lobster\\\" off of my bucket list now.\\n\\nWell during dinner, my 2 year daughter decided she didn't want to eat and just wanted to look at the lobsters.  We took turns taking her up there to stare at the lobsters.  On one of the trips, she decided she wanted a chip from one of the plates to take with her up there.  She was eating the chip and staring at lobsters when she started to choke on the chip.  She was turning red, then was having trouble breathing due to the chip in her throat.  The host and one of the grandma's was with her, and started to help her get the chip out.  She got it out all right.....By vomiting ALL over the place.  Yes, we were THOSE people.  Luckily it went all over the floor and Grandma (poor grandma) and not on other people or the lobsters.  The team at Red Lobster totally handled it, continued to help my kiddo, who was freaking out, got it all cleaned up, and gave us a ton of wet towels to get everyone cleaned up.  Several of the people even came by to check on my kiddo and our group to make sure we were all ok.  They totally went above and beyond what was needed for the incident.  I felt awful for the mess we had made, but they all kept telling me not to worry about it and they seemed to really mean it.  This was customer service at it's best!\\n\\nThanks again Red Lobster for all of the help you gave us and sorry for the mess!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have to say I did review the reviews of this place as I was waiting so I was biased but they did do a good job.\\n\\nI had lunch with my family here because I wanted falafel. I have to say that the falafel wasn't that good. It tasted too fine as if made from a powder. If that is not the case then I was a bit disappointed that they might have over ground the mix. It was good but not anything I'd return for. \\n\\nI did how ever like their fresh pita bread. It was perfect with my falafel platter which came with some pickled veggies.\\n\\nThey serve hummus on the side which was a little runny for my taste.\\n\\nThe fresh pita and hummus were a good combo but both were slightly bland. I wouldn't always necessarily say it was a bad thing but to have something not so salty but some flavor was missing.\\n\\nMy niece had a kids meal which wasn't anything special. My aunt had a chicken wrap that was good.\\n\\nOverall I would return to try some other stuff. Service was good. The young gentlemen was polite and also brought out a pita bread refill. Prices were also good.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We tried this place based on all the Yelp reviews.  What a disappointment. I feel like I threw away $40. We got 3 rolls and none of them were good. Fish was subpar.  Don't believe the hype!\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Mirage was a great place to stay, staff was very courteous.  Rooms have a good layout, inexpensive due to getting 20% off on their specials on facebook.  The pool is really nice, but gets crowded on the weekends.  I hate the idea of having to pay $25 per chair to get to the other areas other than the main pool.  I should all be open, and then there would be enough chairs for most everyone to get sun.  Anyway, the beds were very comfy, rooms are nice, and we were high enough up to have a beautiful view of the strip.  Plenty of things to keep you busy here.  We also had our wedding reception here, and the staff was 5 stars all the way around.  Catering was unbelievable, reasonably priced, did everything that we asked for them.  The hotel does sneak in a $15 \\\"resort fee\\\"charge, per day,  on top of your regular room price).  You have to pay this upon checkout.  The resort fee is basically a sneaky fee that you pay to use the small cardio gym, pool, and internet.  So people that think they are getting free internet because the hotel is nice, are wrong.  I guess knowing that I would be using the internet, I would rather have it like this than actually having an option to pay for it, because if I had a choice, I would not pay the $12-15 fee for it, and be p'od that I have to pay for it.  I know, it doesn't make sense, but I didn't say I was rational.  Valet parking was very quick in getting my car everytime.  The only downside that there wasn't much action in the poker room at the Mirage.  Its the only game I play, and fortunately for me, The Venetian which is right across the road (and much more expensive to stay) and has a lot of action going on.  So it kept me pretty happy rather than having to drive to the Bellagio looking for a action packed poker game.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Can you give zero stars, cuz that's all his place deserves.

Walking in and being mesmorized by the vast amount of pictures staring back at us, we made our way to the table.\\n\\nAs we sat, we noticed a gigantic edible sombrero looking dish that had some kind of delicious food in it. Then and there I knew that this was going to be a place that would get our alcohol drenched insides back to a legal state.\\n\\nAs we got our menu, we closely examined what each meal consisted of. Even though it was late afternoon, our drenched insides were burning yearning for breakfast, with a salad on the side.\\n\\nA few words to describe that god damn delicious salad. \\\"Oh my, yum yum then some!\\\" The CROUTONS, tasted like they came down from the heavens on a lovely white cloud with trumpets blaring announcing that they have made it to the party, also known as the house salad. Word to the wise though, Do not eat, however tempting it might be, do not eat the sticks that accompany that heavenly salad.\\n\\nNot even halfway through eating the heavenly salad, Ferb's tractor breakfast combo, with the biggest pancake known to man, along with eggs, potato and a scrumptious strawberry, came to the table first.  A couple of minutes later, Phineas's mountain of eggs, biscuit and potato joined in. After stealing a couple of Phineas's food, I knew it was the start of a food coma.\\n\\nOne delicious bite after another, I came to the realization that this was the cure of the alcohol and other unmentionable things that we needed. Bang for the buck, this is the place, and we needed this after a crazy night at the penny slots. That's a whole different story.\\n\\n45 minutes of nonstop eating ended up in laying down on the benches outside the restaurant. With the strip in our sights we knew it was time for more alcohol and penny slots.\\n\\nWe are in Vegas.......\\n\\nTo be continued.......\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I have been to this location and the City North location on multiple occasions. We really like the happy hour deals. My boyfriend and I went on a double date the other night and sat on the patio. The server did not seem like he was happy to be there. During our meal we decided that we should leave quickly, not because of the service, but becuase there was an employee (probably off the clock) sitting at the table next to us smoking. The smoke was blowing right into my face and as a non-smoker, I could not stand it.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I really wanted to like this place. I came here with 3 of my friends a few weeks ago. We decided to check it out after the Chandler Light Parade and lighting of the tumbleweed tree, so it was a busy night. We waited about 15 minutes for a table and were quickly served our drinks, but sadly the service went downhill from there. We didn't see our waitress but twice the rest of the evening; once to take our order and once to give us the check. We had to track down someone to refill our drinks and another person entirely brought us our food and was able to get the sides we requested. One of my friends ordered soup that didn't arrive until after his main dish even though the waitress asked if he wanted it early and he said yes. We waited nearly 45 minutes for our order to come out and when it did it was lukewarm. My friends pizza had clearly been sitting out for a while, but I will say they gladly warmed it up. The menu is huge, as are the portions, but unfortunately, they don't seem to do anything overly well. Maybe with the tree lighting they were understaffed, but Iwe weren't impressed. With San Tan just down the street, unless you are searching for a particular game to watch, then I wouldn't put this place on your must-do list.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The King of Tacos doesn't look like much, but the food is great! In fact, when I have been, the place was stuffed from the front to the back terrasse. The poor waitress was everywhere at once! A popular dosh is a bowl made of tacos, and filled with basically everything in the kitchen: veggies, meats, guacamole etc..etc.. I had the cactus salad, it was good, it tasted unlike anything I knew, but needs more cactus!  The huarache is pretty tasty as well, but I'd steer clear of the quesadillas, not enough cheese (to my taste). The guacamole always tends to be cold. odd. Regardless, any dish will plaster your stomach for the day.\\nGo crazy with the desserts, fried coconut donuts, massive churros, snacks on sale by the cashier's desk.. Aaall delicious.

They had some nice combinations for their pizzas and the calzone sounded good. They had no tap beers, which is pretty lame as it is the perfect compliment to pizza. They had a nice brick oven which seemed promising. Sadly they ruined the pizza by busting out a rolling pin on it and thinning it out to a cracker like crust. My wife had the veggie and I had the sausage and mushroom. They were decent.

I said something like, \\\"Oh and you probably clean the outside or polish it or something?\\\" He said that would cost me X amount, because he didn't work for free.  His response was so curt  and defensive that I was taken off guard. Before I could respond, he added, \\\"Go home and wipe it down yourself!\\\" At that point, I should've taken my purse and left.\\n\\nWhen I came back to pick it, I saw that he charged me sales tax. I told him that no sales tax is to be charged on labor. He flew off the handle and started ranting about the government charging all these taxes and that it's not his fault and that I should go talk to the mayor if I had a complaint, bla, bla, bla.  \\n\\nWell I did better than that. I called the Arizona Department of Revenue and confirmed that he absolutely should not be charging tax on labor in his shop.

It had been years since my first trip, because I had dinner on my first visit and wasn't head over heels for the place.  On this occasion, friends of mine chose Olive & Ivy for a Sunday brunch.  The weather was beautiful in Scottsdale so there was a 30 minute wait to eat outside.  We were not in a waiting mood so we sat inside.  The ambiance of this restaurant is very cool and the service is good.  My frittata was eh.  It was not a meal I would rave about, which is why Olive & Ivy only gets 3 stars from me.  However, my friends really enjoyed their meals.  My friend Jess ordered the Margherita flatbread and commented that she would order it again without hesitation.  My friend Mollie enjoyed her Chicken Panini.  I almost gave Olive & Ivy 4 stars because it does have a fantastic brunch menu. Also, the pine nut pesto and bread that they bring to the table is scrumptious! I will return to Olive & Ivy again with a strategy.  I will order the vanilla buttermilk pancakes (saw them on another table and was super jealous!).  If I go for lunch, I will order a flatbread (because so many of those looked so fantastic).

Neutrogena products are a plus.

As it was the end of the year and there was an upcoming New Years event, the whole city was crowded.  We stayed at one of the end of the hallway rooms within Carnaval Towers.  This meant a long walk from the elevators.  I thought that a room at such a spot would be quiet but it was unusually noisy during the night as either the walls are thin or the neighboring guests were loud.\\n\\nI got lost here a few times while wandering through the hallways on our floor.

I have not been to a kona grill in some time due to gluten free restrictions I have to take into account starting a few years ago.  We were shopping in the area and seen they now have a dedicated Gluten Free menu.  When we arrived we asked the hostess if we could view the menu first just to see what options we had.  She was fairly rude, gave us one menu (for 3 people to look at) and walked away.  We decided to stay and eat and then got a server who obviously had no idea about gluten free.  We became an inconvenience for him.  He didn't know any details, didn't offer to ask, and then offered to do a side of fried rice (we've had this gluten free at other places).  About 35 min later I believe the manager, who by the way saved this from being a 1 star review came to our table.  Very nice and asked about our gluten free request.  We let him know we have to eat gluten free.  He then stated that the fried rice Is not gluten free and offered to give us something else.  What I failed to mention before is that when we ordered we asked if we could do a side of fruit with our  turkey burgers.  We were told \\\"No\\\" we don't have that as an option.  Back to the manager, he said we can do vegetables or fruit for you.  Awesome we will take the fruit we said.  We wanted to order that originally but were told you don't have that.  The manager said they do and will take care of that for the future guests to know.

She was very sweet to both our our dogs and extremely responsive when we needed more antibiotic spray and special shampoo to help the spreading. say she is the best vet we have had and I'm glad that when we moved her from WI we had made the right choice when choosing her. \\n  ***** Animal Medical Hospital also has a great puppy plan which helps making all the shots and health visits affordable. And to top that, Dr. Gray told us they price match, so we have been to save about $50 so far in the last two visits by comparing prices online while waiting.  :)\n: great\n\n: We hit up the Earl Sandwich because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Yelp. Overall, however, the food was just okay.\\n\\nWe tried the Full Montagu since this was the most highly recommended sandwich of the lot. Not really flavorful, just okay.\\n\\nWe also tried the tomato soup and chicken Caesar salad, again, all just okay.  The chocolate chip cookie we got for dessert was theiest part of the mealn\\nRelatively cheap for Vegas, but definitely not worth the wait.\n: neutral\n\n: After trusting many other reviews I was sourly disappointed.  \\nI am into checking out dives because that's where the best food is at.  But this place was dive-y just to be dive-y and the food was nothing special.  I also went on others suggestions of getting the fried rice.  But it was not the best fried rice I've ever had.  I'm pretty easy to please in regards to food, except when I've made better in my own kitchen and I am not a cook.   \\n\\nmajor booooooooo\n: bad\n\n: Good sandwiches, strong 420 vibe.\\n\\nIt's hard to order anything besides the white widow because it is just sooo goodn\\nDon't forget to grab a homemade rice krispie treat. \\n\\nThey deliver, but expect it to take an hour if you live close.\n: good\n\n: As I would not like toive my night here, I am just going to say the following:\\n\\n1. Extremely rude employees\\n. Horrible music. You will feel like sardines in a can\\n. The dance floor is the of a modest 2 car garage.n\\nNever again.\n: terrible\n\n: We tried this place based on all the Yelp reviews.  What a disappointment. I feel like I threw away $40. We got 3 rolls and none of them were good. Fish was subpar.  Don't believe the hype!\n: bad\n\n: Mirage was a great place to stay, staff was very courteous.  Rooms have a good layout, inexpensive to getting 20% off on their specials on facebook.  The pool is really nice, but gets crowded on the weekends.  I hate the idea of having to pay $25 per chair to get to the other areas other than the main pool.  I should all be open, and then there would be enough chairs for most everyone to get sun.  Anyway, the beds were very comfy, rooms are nice, and we were high enough up to have a beautiful view of the strip.  Plenty of things to keep you busy here.  We also had our wedding reception here, and the staff was 5 stars all way around.  Catering was unbelievable, reasonably priced, did everything that we asked for them.  The hotel does sneak in a $15 \\\"ort fee\\\"charge, per day,  on of your regular room price).  You have to pay this upon checkout.  The resort fee is basically aaky fee that you pay to use the small cardio gym, pool, and internet.  So people that think they are getting free internet because the hotel is nice, are wrong.  I guess knowing that I would be using the internet, I would rather have it like this than actually having an option to pay for it, because if I had a choice, I would not pay the $12-15 fee for it, and be p'od that I have to pay for it.  I know, it doesn't make sense, but I't say I was rational.  Valet parking was very quick in getting my car everytime.  The only downside that there't much action in the poker room at the Mirage.  Its the only game I play, and fortunately for me, The Venetian which is right across the road (and much more expensive to stay) and has a lot of action going on.  So it kept me pretty happy rather than having to drive to theio looking for a action packed poker game.\n: good\n\n: Can you give zero stars, cuz that's all his place deserves. Will not come back.\n: terrible\n\n: Ferb and I finally put down the hookahs and set aside the other unmentionable things and decided a road trip to the \\\"Sin City\\\", Vegas was due. \\n\\nAfter a couple of all nighters out and about it wasn't until the last day of our trip that we decided to go to Hash House a go-go. Walking in and being mesmorized by the vast amount of pictures staring back at us, we made our way to the tablen\\nAs we sat, we noticed a gigantic edible sombrero looking dish that had some of delicious food in it. Then and there I knew that this was to be a place that would get our alcohol drenched insides back to a legal state\\nAs we got our menu, we closely examined what each meal consisted of. Even though it was late afternoon, our drenchedides were burning yearning for breakfast, with a salad on side\\nA few words to describe that god damn delicious salad. \\\"Oh my, yum yum then some!\\\" The CROUTONS, tasted like they came down from the heavens on a lovely white cloud with trumpets blaring announcing that they have made it to the party, also as the house salad. Word to the wise though, Do not eat, however tempting it might be, do not eat the sticks that accompany that heavenly salad.\\n\\nNot even halfway through eating the heavenly salad, Ferb's tractor breakfast combo, with the biggestake to man, along with eggs, potato and a scrious strawberry, came to the table first.  A couple of minutes later, Phineas's mountain of eggs, biscuit and potato joined in. After stealing a couple of Phas's food, I knew it was the start of a food coman\\nOne delicious bite after another, I came to the realization that this was the cure of the alcohol and other unmentionable things that we needed. Bang for the buck, this is the place, and we needed this after a crazy night at the penny slots.

With the strip in our sights we knew it was time for more alcohol and penny slotsn\\nWe are in Vegas.......\\n\\nTo be continued.......\n: great\n\n: The King of Tacos doesn't look like much, but the food is great! In fact, when I have been, the place was stuffed from the front to the back terrasse. The poor waitress was everywhere at once! A popular dosh is a bowl made of tacos, and filled with basically everything in the kitchen: veggies, meats, guacamole etc..etc.. I had the cactus salad, it was good, it tasted unlike anything I knew, but needs more cactus!  The huarache is pretty tasty as well, but I'd steer clear of the quesadillas, not enough cheese (to my taste). The guole always to be cold. odd. Regardless, any dish will plaster your stomach for the day.\\nGo crazy with the desserts, fried coconut donuts, massive churros, snacks on sale by the cashier's desk.. Aaall delicious. In fact, go crazy with everything, El Rey let's you buy guole by the gallon, multicoloured nachos, cacti (oh yeah!) and more (like lucha libre masks), while watching mexican Tv. We have a winner!\n: good\n\n: This place was nice and clean but my roll was not good all.

Either way a walk in or an appointment they have been very accommodating. Nice and clean inside. Very modern and girly fun!n\\nI have just gotten my eyebrows done only (so far) ;) and the wax room is exactly what you want to be like. One review said it looked like a lab, I will admit it is white in there and very bright but when it comes to waxing and body parts I want bright lights so they can see every stray, every hair, etc. \\n\\nOwner and staff have done a job and are very welcoming. \\n\\nUsed to have to drive to southpark area to get my waxing but no more, I found a place and I'm sticking to it!

They had some nice combinations for their pizzas and the calzone sounded good. They had no tap beers, which is pretty lame as it is the perfect compliment to pizza. They had a nice brick oven which seemed promising. Sadly they ruined the pizza bying out a rolling pin on it and thinning it out to aacker like crust. My wife had the veggie and I had the sausage and mushroom. They were decent. But, again they need to hand toss the crust as it was way too thin.\n: neutral\n\n: good ambiance, iffy wine (the house was better than the listed wines) and the cheese was not appropriate as spreadable and quite frankly the bread was bad. stay for 1 drink and move on.\n:\n\n: This old school low-pro lounge has a relaxed vibe that is a welcome change from Madison's frenetic bar scene.

Best feature: the Location which is fantastic being right at the cross of St. Hubert and Ste Catherine as as having direct access tori/UQAM station and is directly across from the Bus Terminal (Airport bus terminus). So for walking, taking metro, the hotel could not be more convenient - you can get to anywhere in Montreal you'd want to go pretty easily. \\n\\nBeyond that, this is your basic hotel. No super frills - Except they do have free WiFi (which worked really well) and a pool (which I did not have the to use). The decor is, yes, a tad dated but it's not gross or sooooo terrible. Neutrogena products are a plus. The buffet breakfast was really pretty good, alson\\nIf you just want a place to crash and't plan on spending the of your time in the hotel, this is a good option.

I had just eaten a late breakfast, but I needed to check my email so my LA ATT.com dsl service add on gives me nationwide free wifi at McD's, Starbucks and many other locations. So, I don't like to go to a place and just use the wifi and not buy anything, so I bought the Angus burger swiss cheese/mushroom and it was okay, 3 stars, but I'ming 2 stars for the crappy wifi service... I've used McD's wifi service many times and at this location, I dicked around for nearly hour and't get it to work... So I bought food I't really want and so it was a big waste of time and money.

When we found out the soup was New England clam chowder, my husband HAD to order it for the sheer curiosity factor of how they would do clam chowder in the desert. The answer: Not well. There were carrots?? in it, and it was so thin. The taste wasn't bad, but   doesn't get the Bostonian seal of approval.\\n\\nMy husband had the fish and chips which were HUGE, and the cole slaw was actually really tasty.

After a great weekend vacation in Sedona we stopped by Scottsdale for a night before returning home.  Our intention was a day and night of ultimate relaxation.

As a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas Strip, I am also a frequent visitor to the Bellagio and specially The Fountains of Bellagio. Dancing water fountains which are synchronized to the music are graceful, beautiful and relaxing. Each show is a totally different and worth waiting until the next show! My best tip is that if you are planning to stay at The Bellagio, make sure you get a room with a fountain view! You can listen to the music on your TV while you look down on the fountains. Each show is about 3 to 5 minutes long and show times are every 15 minutes. The fountains look good in the daytime but really shine in the nighttime! Wow! Highly recommended!!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Fun place for a date or to hang with friends! Restaurants, dessert places, bars, and lots of nice places to take pictures.

The Miso Soup tasted like sea water.  Wayyyy too salty.  Any taste I could perceive beyond the salt was too 'fishy'.  Not good.  The rice on the sushi was either not fresh or undercooked, far firmer than it should be.  Flavor was absent on rolls, partially because the actual meat portions are less than the fingernail on my little pinky.  Far diminished from our past visits.  One of our rolls also tasted 'fishy', which might not seem strange except that it was a Crab Roll.  \\nThe service was backwards as well.  She brought out two plates of sushi, then forgot to bring the ginger and wasabi, Lol.  After she came back with that, we politely requested the Kikkoman.

However, for $2.50-3.00 can you really complain?\\n\\nThe food was really similar to an L&L in regards to taste and price. The BBQ mix plate comes with a couple pieces of chicken, a handful of sliced beef and a strip of kalbi. The macaroni salad was a little bland and just ok. The meats were well seasoned and overall tasty; I just wished there was more than just a single strip of kalbi!\\n\\nNot sure if the food is worth driving down here for since it's similar to L&L and any other Hawaiian joint that serves BBQ style food. I probably would come again for thai tea though the next time I'm on this side of town\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Unlike the review from the 22nd we were treated exceptionally. We are a younger couple without the glitz and glam but we were treated like royalty. Perhaps the difference was the server. In our case we had Paul and he was absolutely awesome.   \\n\\nBefore going on with the review let me back up a bit. We were looking for a place to eat that night and were walking through the Bellagio when my wife said, \\\"That Olives restaurant has a balcony but it is first-come, first-serve so we probably could not get out there.\\\". Me being the kind of guy who would rather ask and get told \\\"no\\\" than not ask at all went up to the hostess and asked about any openings on the balcony. To my amazement I was told there would be a table for two in 45 minutes if I cared to wait. With the night being beautiful and a chance to sit outside and eat we readily agreed to wait. Approximately 30 minutes later we were led out to the balcony and seated. The balcony is small, I'd venture to guess there was enough space for about 30 people. I do not know for sure but I believe the tables directly next to the edge overlooking the Bellagio Fountain were reserved for Black Card (mlife) holders which we were not. We were seated at the back of the balcony but we could still see the fountains and had a beautiful view of the strip. (We also just happened to be seated at 7pm when the fountains played every 15 minutes so we saw the whole line up of songs during our dinner...I highly recommend this timing). \\n\\nLike I said in the beginning, Paul was our server and he was wonderful. He treated us like we were special though we were not in suits, not bedazzled in jewelry, and certainly no high-roller status. We were dressed nicely though a few on the balcony were dressed very poorly even for a casual dining restaurant. We were served with smiles and warmth as was everyone else out there including the poorly dressed group though by a different server.\\n\\nPaul even took our picture for us with our camera during what he called \\\"Picture time\\\". He had an excellent sense of humor that matched ours which seems hard to do these days. He made our night. \\n\\nThe customer service, view, and fountains were amazing but the food...boy was that some of the best food we have eaten in a while. The drinks were made perfectly, the complimentary bread basket paired with the Olive Tapenade was one of a kind. Delicious! The flat bread...well it did not last long. For entrees my wife ordered the chicken and I ordered Salmon. My meal was perfect, my wife's chicken was overdone but still tasty. We could have probably requested a new one but it was not inedible and it was still very delicious so we did not. We were too full for dessert though what I saw others eating looked amazing. \\n\\nOverall, an excellent experience and I would go back if I was back in Vegas. I also highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal. If you are willing to wait for the balcony I would do it and try to time it for the more frequent fountain shows. Well worth it! \\n\\nTry to get Paul as he was amazing, though the rest seemed equally as awesome.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Solid authentic Mexican food. Close knit Mexican family.

I had lunch there again today and left disappointed again. I eat lunch out 5 days a week always at nice places mostly on business. This place does not stand up against others in the neighborhood and price range. Parking is always a hassle the valet is a mess and takes too long because the garage is a way off by Urban Outfitters. The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses. After putting my folder on the floor, no space on the table, I ordered. Veal and spinach ravioli, four very small excellent ravioli for $15, one of which was gristle and which I had to spit out. The portion was a ridiculous excuse for an entree portion. I'm done with this place and don't see going back.

Everyone is always talking about how great and \\\"authentic\\\" it is, but it just seems like standard, uninteresting Mexican fast-food fare to me. Plus, from what I have always heard, although Americanized-Mexican dishes rely on mounds of cheese, real, authentic Mexican food is rarely covered in a cup and a half of shredded cheddar. I don't know, though The food was okay and the service was okay and the prices are okay, but that's really all I can say about it...it's okay. I will say that, when I was in, their salsa/veggie bar was absolutely wrecked.

Their service is phenomenal - we've been very impressed with the professionalism.  The quality of the photos is excellent, the contract process is effortless and, most of all, it is so much fun!!  Our guests from both weddings have continued to talk about how much fun the photo booth was - we outfitted the booth with hats and boas and other costume items and set up a scrapbooking station just outside of the booth.  The booth operator seamlessly worked with us to create a fun environment for our guests, the couple got very fun guestbooks, and the guests got fun photos to take home as \\\"favors.\\\"  I recommend Party Booths!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I'm not sure why they serve pickles with the bread, but they are fantastic!  I had a hard time not eating all of them.  I ordered a ribeye that was rubbed with garlic and it was cooked perfectly!  I have been to a lot of high end steakhouses and I can honestly say this steak is near the top of the list.  I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere though.  For the price, it was pretty loud and crowded and tables were basically crammed into a giant room with very little in the way of ambiance.  The service, on the other hand, was top notch.  The waiter was excellent at being very attentive without seeming like he was hovering over us.  Our water and wine were constantly refilled and the food came out at an excellent pace.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: The reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. We have received poor service from them. Their service is inconsistent. At times they are great and at other times, they were there for 5 minutes and left. They promise to provide all of these service with each cleaning and in our experience, they have not done so. I can't recall the last time I saw them brush the sides of our pool. They don't always empty every basket. And I've never seen them vacuum the pool floor. And we paid for their highest level of service. We've called to complain about their techs being not thorough and they were rather defensive and didn't apologize or see what they could do to improve service. Overall, this is the attitude they seem to embrace. Rather than put the customer first, they get defensive. There have been other problems. For example, they stopped providing service on two separate occasions. In my opinion, their front office is disorganized. On two different occasions, they stopped providing service due to problems with their front office. On one occassion, they lost our billing information and another, they forgot to put us on their schedule.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Walked in before noon time today by myself, the place was empty.  The hostess asked if I would like to sit at the bar or full service, I said full.  She put me right behind of the order machine (which I wasn't aware of at that time) where every waiter or waitress took their orders would go behind me to enter those orders.  Worst place to sit in the house!\\nMy server was okay, he wasn't very helpful when I asked a few questions.  First I asked about what type of hot tea is good for sore throat (from cold), no specific answer was given, fine!  So I ordered a tropical green tea, not bad.\\nThen I started with a cup of wonton soup, but I tried to change my order for a bowl instead of cup after 10 seconds of my order, he said too late, the order has been entered (the machine just right behind of me, ding2x).  I felt like it was quite rude to say that..., sure there's a way to revise.  My vibe was going down south from that point.\\nAfter glancing at the menu, I decided shrimp candied walnut based on one of the yelp review.  Then he asked if I want a lunch portion that came with soup or salad, or dinner (he only gave me a dinner menu).  Well..., if I knew it did come with soup, I may not order the wonton soup in the first place, since I'm not a salad person.  I ended up with a dinner portion.  I wasn't impressed with the meal, it was a cold creamy dish.  The white rice was dried, tasted like overnight rice.  Had a few bites, decided to take it home.  Since the place was getting busy, all the entire of orders just came straight behind me!!  Very annoying!!!  The manager came by and asked if everything was okay, I didn't want to make a scene out of it, so I was politely said okay.  All of these happened, I still gave 18-20% tip, but I won't be back again..., thanks to the hostess, service & disappointed food.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I have mix feelings on this place, that's it, 3.5 stars...\\n\\nTwo of us stopped at Bobby's after a movie, being my 1st time here, didn't really know what to expect, and I was in flip-flops...So here's a bit of recap:\\n\\n-Bread basket - warm baked garlic/cheese bread, definitely one of a kind...\\n\\n-Blue Point Oysters on half shelf - fresh and mid-siazed oysters, pair with fresh lemon juice, some horseradish and some tabasco sauce, this just made my day!! Surprisingly, the usual customers of Bobby's don't seem to have oysters with tabasco cuz when I asked for it, our waitress had to reconfirm, and it didn't come in the original bottle, instead was pulled into a little sauce/juice cup...just kinda of weird... But I don't mind as long as the oysters are good!\\n\\n-Cannelloni with Mariana sauce - tasty and filling, but feel like the Mariana sauce was kind of short, maybe they could pour a bit more sauce? It's a bit dry eating without the sauce...but overall it's good.\\n-Lobster linguini - many different kinds of seafood (lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels) in a Mariana sauce. It didn't give me a surprising feeling, I think it was just average, and the noodles were a bit dry and hard...\\n\\n-No dessert. What a surprise? Well, they 'presented' the whole menu on a tray. Seriously? I've seen raw food being presented on a tray to show the freshness, not dessert. I guess when I order dessert, I always wait for the excitement to come, to surprise me, I mean it's dessert, you can do so many imaginations with it, I have never seen restaurants have created a same exact look of dessert before (unless it's the standard form)... so I'm expecting something does not only feed my taste bug but also eye-catching...after I saw the whole presentation, I didn't want any, that just blew off my hopes..\\n\\nOverall experience at Bobby's was just fine.

The furniture selection is strong and the prices are fair. If I would have rated Living Spaces the moment we left the store they would have gotten a 4 or 5 from me. \\n\\nBut-- the customer service you receive after leaving the store, presumably from the corporate office, is very poor. We ordered multiple pieces of furniture, including a custom sectional. The couch arrived with one of the pieces of furniture made with the wrong fabric. They never followed up with us like they promised -- we had to call three times. It took a month to get a replacement piece. Also, the driver tripped on his way in the house ripping the fabric on another piece-- it has still not been replaced.\\n\\nBefore I received this bad service I made the mistake of recommending them to my parents. They told my parents the drivers would call a half hour before they arrived to deliver their furniture-- it didn't happen, they just showed up. When my father wanted to return a couple pieces that didn't work out, they told us they would call a day before to give us a pickup window. It never happened. We've waited all day today for it to come-- it is now after 6pm, they never showed, never called. \\\"Good bye\\\" to my Saturday, thanks Living Spaces!\\n\\nThe good people who work at the Scottsdale store are really undermined by the corporate office, it's too bad. I would pass on Living Spaces because of it. The customer service department is awful. They aren't accountable. And they apparently have no communication with the drivers. Bottom line, they just aren't ready for the business. The only reason I didn't rate them a \\\"1\\\" is due to the positive shopping experience.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This place needs to be featured on an episode of Bar Rescue.\\n\\nBeyond terrible service.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: TI was is a nice hotel right on the strip.

After a great weekend vacation inona we stopped by Scottsdale for a night before returning home.  Our intention was a day and night of ultimate relaxation.  This place was everything but relaxing.  \\n\\nThe reason we picked Firesky was because of the pictures of the beautiful pool area.  The pool area actually doesn't really look like the pictures.  The kiddy pool is separated and kind of resembles what we thought it would like.  However, we't expect a of children in swim diapers. \\n\\nThe adult pool was like spring break in CanCun with a bunch of 20 somings drinking anding.  100 people were packed into the area and music was blaring.  Occasionally two music systems would be running and you would hear hotel music under the louder party music. n\\nWe got massages hoping to down after a very intense not expected pool scene.

Wayyyy too salty.  Any taste I could perceive beyond the salt was too 'fishy'.  Not good.  The rice on the sushi was either not fresh or undercooked, farmer than it should be.  Flavor was absent on rolls, partially because the actual meat portions are less than the fingernail on my little pinky.  Far diminished from our past visits.  One of our rolls also tasted 'fishy', which might not seem strange except that it was a Crab Roll.  \\nThe service was backwards as well.  She brought out two plates of sushi, then forgot to bring the ginger and wasabi, Lol.  After she came back with that, we politely requested the Kikkoman.  We like the ambiance and location and which is so close, and we will try it ONE time.  Hopefully the management will read this review and get their act together.\n: bad\n\n: Solid authentic Mexican food. Close knit Mexican family.

This place does not stand up against others in the neighborhood and price range. Parking is always a hassle the valet is a mess and takes too long because the garage is a way off by Urbanfitters. The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses. After putting my folder on the floor, no space on the table, I ordered. Veal and spinachavioli, four very small excellentavioli for $15, one of which was gristle and which I had to spit out. The portion was a ridiculous excuse for anree portion. I'm done with this place and't see going back.

Entree pricing is in line with what you might expect elsewhere, and nicely enough, the first bloody mary, screwdriver, or mimosa you order with a brunch entree is $2.  Stick with the mimosa in this case; those received positive reviews, whereas my bloody mary was a disaster of a drink.  The mix is made in-house but is neither spicy nor interesting, but could have been saved if it hadn't been for the lethal layer of vodka floating on top.

Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by and large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlic naan, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.   \\n\\nI was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice & crusty, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect from tandoori - instead it was hard, chewy and disappointing.  Companion's entree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like an appetizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tandoori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \\n\\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence.

It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  \\n\\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So, being stuck at the Golden Nugget for a conference with a limited amount of time, I decided, (translation - had no choice) to give this place a try for breakfast. I wish I had seen enough of my waiter from yesterday to know if I had the same guy - and hopefully he saw too little of me to realize I was the same person, but the food and service were terrific (yes, only 2 stars. \\\"terrific\\\" is all relative).\\n\\nSat down, took my order and before I could blink....wa la! my food!. I had the egg white fritatta. Outside of it being pretty greasy (but this could have been the cheese) it was pretty darn good. \\n\\nJust in case he remembered me, I left him a pretty sizable tip.\\n\\nI would go back....for a selective breakfast order....Denny's style.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I really like the cool space in AiRia, DJ always play great music and I highly impressed with the good service from their security that allow me and my group to sit at VIP cause they appreciate us came early at Friday when they just open.

I wish they could develop the bench or the a cool place in the bar for sitting.. that would be awesome..\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: \\\"Extremely Cool Without Being Pretentious\\\"\\n\\nSecond time at the Vig Uptown.  Brunch.  Just really cool modern surroundings... but not just surface modern, but deep modern aesthetics that just feel comfortable and real.\\n\\nSat in the atrium type outside, which is really like an inside garage with big windows and air conditioning.  It's like being outside in the best temperature in Phoenix, even if it's over 100 degrees.\\n\\nFood was very good.  Relatively large portions for an upscale establishment.\\n\\nMy wife had the $15 salmon, recommended by the server as the best thing on the menu, and it did not disappoint.  Would easily cost 2x at other restaurants, and probably be worth it. \\n\\nI had the Hangover cure, and it was easily enough food to take home and have for breakfast the next day.  Very tasty for $10.  And I got the $3 spicy bloody mary that came with it, which was one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.\\n\\nAt noon, on the Sunday we went, a really nice band came in and played some great acoustic rock, very nice.  \\n\\nIt was one of the best brunch experiences we've had in Phoenix.\\n\\nAdd to this the fact that all wine on the menu, if ordered by the bottle, is 50% off, and that's an outstanding deal.\\n\\nWe'll be back.  I kicked myself for not coming back sooner.  \\n\\nMy five star is a rating that is influenced by pricing.  I am a cheap bastard with expensive tastes, so I reward a restaurant that I not only feel I had great food, nice ambiance, and good service, but that I got my money's worth.\\n\\nAnd The Vig Uptown is all that and then some.  I strongly recommend it to all.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This review is for the automotive \\\"services\\\" I received there recently. I brought in my car just for a simple seasonal tire switch. My regular mechanic couldn't take me and of course being the impatient type (plus winter was TOOOO long this year) I really wanted to put my summer tires on. Well, I was greeted very nicely and told it would be an hour wait. No problem. The store itself is big, clean and well stocked. I then get paged to be told that I needed 1000$ of suspension and brake repairs!!! I had just got the car fully inspected a month before by my regular trusted mechanic since I want to trade the car and he found nothing wrong with the suspension or brakes. I told them thanks for the tip, please put my tires on that is it. Be careful, there was an Area Manager that day in the garage and they were trying really hard to upsell or promote BS repairs on a lot of customers. I witnessed another customer tell off the service tech regarding BS repairs.

If you're in Plaza-Midwood and scoping out a convenience store/coffee house/beer market/bakery, you should visit this place.  It's practically a hipster general store.\\n\\nThey have a lunch counter that is packed at lunchtime.  Your typical lunch counter staples, like reuben on rye, clubs, and paninis, but with fancier breads, meats, and cheeses.   They have a convenience store selection of chips and homemade cookies/brownies to complete your lunch. Did I mention that they are several brews of coffee?  Plus, its only a $1 if you bring your own mug!  The beverage selection is out of this world!  Many foreign brands with many, many syllables.  \\n\\nCommon Market is also loaded with hipster trinkets;  like dress-up Jesus magnets, cooler and more socially conscious-than-thou bumper stickers, and \\\"papers\\\"...he he.

Though traditional dishes found on the menus of most Indian restaurants make up the bulk of the menu, some interesting plates catch your attention immediately. One dish that sounded particularly enticing to us was the Paneer Chili ($7), an appetizer of homemade, mild Indian cheese dressed in a sweet and sour sauce with green peppers and onions. I know it sounds strange, but it was actually quite successful. The sauce wasn't sickeningly sweet and artificial tasting as sweet and sour often can be, and we loved tasting Chinese flavors in a dish that actually had some heat.\\n\\nNon-fusion dishes were just as successful. The sauce of the lamb rogan josh ($15) was a deep brick red and flavor-PACKED, letting you know someone loved it for awhile. My mushroom and sweet corn masala ($13) was served in a sauce that was equally complex and flavorful, yet I was disappointed to see that canned mushrooms were used. The sauce was so incredible, however, I really didn't mind at all. Anyone who can make canned mushrooms taste so good gets a big culinary thumbs up from me. I also enjoyed the addition of corn, which replaced the more common peas found in many Indian mushroom dishes.\\n\\nFun little extras included a superb raita with crunchy chunks of cucumber and crispy onion pakora. If you love onion rings, the latter is a must try. We also loved the bullet naan ($5), a flatbread stuffed with cheese, potatoes, chickpeas, onion, cilantro, and green chilies. It made me think this restaurant could do well as the first Indian pizza joint.\\n\\nSadly, I fear this restaurant may not survive due to it's location. It's actually fairly easy to get to as it is right off the 95 at Craig, but the new strip center it's in is dead with no signs of budding life. I hate seeing these mom and pop's dissolve - R.I.P Taqueria Los Parados and Vegas Cafe.\\n\\nI hope I can entice you to go by mentioning that restaurant.com is currently offering certificates valid for dinner only. Today they have 60% off for St. Patty's Day with the code LUCKY, but if you sign up for their updates they offer discounts just as deep nearly every week. You can also same money by taking advantage of their great lunch buffet. The number of items is limited, but it's a bargain at just $8.99.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: We gave this place several chances. The first bad experience was when they claimed it would be 45 minutes to an hour for our delivery. An hour and a half later, our freezing food arrived. We thought next time to just not order on a Friday. So we ordered again, and had to call and check up on the delivery after an hour. Food finally arrived, and one of the drinks was missing. We finally gave it one last shot today, and after an hour and a half, we called, and were promised it would be \\\"any minute.\\\" Twenty minutes later, still nothing. I finally called after almost two hours to cancel the order. The driver arrived in the parking lot shortly after, but who would want to eat the freezing food he had with him. Never, ever again. We will be finding somewhere else to order for our office. I put the menu back up in the break room with a note to warn anyone else off.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Pile'em up Bob's is another spot that's been around forever.  They've changed over years as far as management as the original owner was known to 'pile' your plate up with food to the point that it would barely close if it closed at all.  They're known for the burgers and fish, but they also sell breakfast food, subs, hot dogs, gizzards and the usual artery clogging foods.  I was sad to see that the new owners use what seem to be frozen burgers now but the original owner made the real deal homemade burgers from ground meat.  The food is still good and the portions though not as huge as before, is still quite a bit of food.  It is completely take out only and they do take debit cards($5.00 minimum).  \\n\\nAs an fyi, if you're fearful of going to the hood this may not be the spot for you.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Honestly, it's all pretty much hype. I like the NYC one, but there was at least an hour wait at this one, and we didn't have 3 hours to spend at an ice cream shop. So we got some things from the \\\"take out\\\" window.

When we booked the room we were told that the pre-auth was $100.  As it turns out, it was $100 per night, which for us, was $300.  Additionally, because my boyfriend asked that I have charging privileges, they authorized an additional $300, plus some other charges we did not authorize.  We were able to get it straightened out with the front desk, but an up-front explanation would have been better and led to less frustration on our part.\\n\\nThat's really it... other than that, it's a place to sleep and shower.

I came here with my bf recently and once we entered we weren't greeted for a while. We went to the cashier and asked him if we just sit anywhere and he looked at us like we should've known that already. \\n\\nHe gave us our menus which was your generic \\\"vegan\\\" menu with wraps, paninis, salads, and a minuscule variety of anything else.  We opted for pasta that had fake meat and avocado in it. We got fries with cheese and tomatoes for our appetizer. The pasta came with a very bitter side salad. And drinks? We just stuck to water, there was no way we were paying for their ridiculously priced drinks. \\n\\nThe whole time it seemed like the server/cashier guy was mad at us. He kind of sighed when we only ordered one dish and every time we looked at him he wasn't smiling, unless he was talking to a regular. \\n\\nThe bitter salad came after 10 minutes. 20 minutes after that we still didn't have our food, not even the fries. We noticed a couple sitting in front of us that was already there when we got in; They looked like they were getting antsy and nothing was on their table yet. The girl went up to the cashier to ask her how much longer they're going to have to wait since it looked like they weren't doing anything in their kitchen, and he told her it won't be much longer. THEN you see them start making their sandwich and chickn nuggets. They got their tiny plate of chicken nuggets along with their sandwich and boy did they look mad! I would've been mad too if it took them almost an hour to bring out a sandwich and 5 nuggets. \\n\\nAbout 40 minutes into waiting we got our fries and pasta. \\n\\nWow, those fries were disgusting! You can totally tell how dried out and gross they must've been by the pictures I provided. It was like they chopped some potatoes,sprinkled cheese on top and left them in the oven to burn. Then took them out and sprinkled a few pieces of tomato on it. If I had my eyes closed while eating this I probably would've thought it was cardboard that a homeless person wrote on. \\n\\nThe pasta....was even worse. It tasted spoiled, like they went and left it in someone's car for a day, then took it back inside and put some fresh avocado on it. It was just sour and very bland. The fake meat on it tasted just like the pasta, it added no flavor. The only thing it added to the dish was the artificial appearance of it looking good. \\n\\nIt really bugs me when \\\"Vegan\\\" places stick to serving bland food and charging more money for it just because it has the title of being Vegan. Considering I've gone to many other REAL vegan joints, I can safely say that this place deserves one star. Their fake meat has absolutely no flavor or any texture that makes it seem real at all. \\n\\nJust go to an asian restaurant and order lots of flavorful vegan selections for half the price.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Cheese curds were good but don't eat too much because you'll have a tummy ache afterwards.

Definitely not bad or awful, but maybe if I sandwiched a later supper  between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of Kingfishers, I'd stumble out with a hazier (and happier ) overall impression.  \\n\\nNothing I've ever eaten here was truly bad enough to take back - or savory enough to inspire a return visit. Portions tend to be small and sauces are, by large, mild and rather one dimensional.  Other than the garlican, I cant  remember a dish smelling really awesome as it waed by, which is a shame considering Indian cuisine is among the world's most aromatic.  n\\nI was eager to share yesterday's lambi kabob, as the portion was good sized - about 15-20 small cubes of lamb (not mega kabob sized cubes, but a very respectable portion for $10-11), on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers.  The lamb exterior was nice &y, but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd expect fromandoori - instead it was hard,y and disappointing.  Companion'sree was 3 tiny vegetable fritters orplings buried in a thick sauce, that looked more like anizer.  Chicken dishes are generally better - the tori version is good, and similar to most Indian joints.  I recommend the three hot relishes (red sauce, green puree, and pickled peppers) provided tableside, as house preparations, at least in my experience, tend to be mild. \\n\\nServers are generally Anglo, pleasant and competent during the meal, but just about every time we walk in for dinner at 5 or 5:30, the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence. Nobody's overtly rude, but instead of a really warm welcome, you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you, as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to with the first dinner customer of the evening. It's not oppressive, but it's happened more than once and I'm not crazy about the vibe.  \\n\\nI do like the complimentary, self serve chai tea and open kitchen, providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit. Nice touches.   The menu is extensive, all told about sixty items, and reasonably priced for Indian food. Indian textiles, jewelry and artwork is often on display, for sale, and the house music is too loud if you have thefortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker. It got turned down, eventually, but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary American tolerances better than that. n\\nThe atmosphere is up and down. Food's OK. Service is OK. Ask my family and they'll each give it four or five stars. In my book, Tandoori Times is just OK.\n: neutral\n\n: So, being stuck at the Goldenget for a conference with a limited of time, I decided, (translation - had no choice) to give this place a try for breakfast.

I wish they could develop the bench or the a cool place in the bar for sitting.. that would be awesome..\n: good\n\n: This review is for the automotive \\\"services\\\" I received there recently. I brought in my car just for a simple seasonal tire switch. My regular mechanic couldn't take me and of course being the impatient type (plus winter was TOOOO long this year) I really wanted to put my summer tires on. Well, I was greeted very nicely and told it would be an hour wait. No problem. The store itself is big, clean and well stocked. I then getaged to be told that I needed 1000$ of suspension and brake repairs!!! I had just got the car fully inspected a month before by my regular trusted mechanic since I want to trade the car and he found nothing wrong with the suspension or brakes. I told them thanks for the tip, please put my tires on that is it. Be careful, there was an Area Manager that day in the garage and they were trying really hard toell or promote BS repairs on a lot of customers. I witnessed another customer tell off the service tech regarding BS repairs. Honestly I rarely go to CT for automotive services, but can tell you the Laalle branch is a lot more honest than these crooks.\n: terrible\n\n: So Juan's work is BAD ASS, Basically everything on chopper I have had done by him looks great and I get compliments on everything all time. people are shocked when I tell them it is powder coat not paint. n\\nSo why the 2 stars...as his biz grew his delivery time went to shit for us \\\"small people\\\".\\nExamplesn--first starting his biz a set of wheels, quoted 5 days, got them in I beleive 4 days\\n2 yrs later motorcycle frame  q\n: bad\n\n: Common Market is the freakin' jam!

It's practically a hipster storen\\nThey have a lunch counter that is packed at lunchtime.  Your typical lunch counter staples, like reuben onye, clubs, and paninis, but with fancier breads, meats, and cheeses.   They have a convenience store selection of chips and homemade cookies/bies to complete your lunch. Did I mention that they are several brews of coffee?  Plus, its only a $1 if you bring your own mug!  The beverage selection is out of this world!  Many foreign brands with many, many syllables. n\\nCommon Market is also loaded with hipster trets;  like dress-up Jesus magnets, cooler and more socially conscious-thanou bumper stickers, and \\\"papers\\\"...he he.  So if you want to get your lunch on, caffeine on, or just roll your own...this is your joint.\n: good\n\n: Pile'em up Bob's is another spot that's been around forever.  They've changed over years as as management as the original owner was known to 'pile' your plate up with food to the point that it would barely close if it closed all.  They're known for the burgers and fish, but they also sell breakfast food, subs, hot dogs, gizzards and the usual artery clogging foods.  I was sad to see that the new owners use what seem be frozen burgers now but the original owner made the real deal homemade burgers from ground meat.  The food is still good and the portions though not as huge as before, is still quite a bit of food.  It is completely take out only and they do take debit cards($5.00 minimum).  \\n\\nAs an fyi, if you're fearful of going to the hood this may be the spot you.\n: neutral\n\n: Honestly, it's all pretty much hype. I like the NYC one, but there was at least an hour wait at this one, and we't have 3 hours to spend at an ice cream shop. So we got some things from the \\\"take out\\\" window. Which is ridiculously limited in choices. The ice cream itself is fine, but so is Queen. Definitely't waste my time there if I'm ever back in Vegas.\n: bad\n\n: One of my favorite pizza places!!! I usually get the white pizza with pepperoni. Very simply but delicious. I'm not a of red sauce so I'm glad this place offers the white sauce for the pizza. I also order the Cesar salad i love how theirs taste because the lettuce is always chilled makes the salad taste so much better.

He told us they don't make them anymore.  Um okay,Bummer. That was one of the main reasons I loved this place. Service was okay, and I't impressed by the food. The portions were small for the price and the quality of our meals were just subpar.\n: bad\n\n: I have been coming here for about 6 months. It is a great place to hear live music from blues to acoustic guitar on the patio. The chicken wings are 810 and the waitresses are from 5 9 on the service but generally overworked and pleasant.

I am truly *st* that this was the Palms -- I had the idea that this was a pretty chic hotel and I can you, it is not.

We were one row off the road and way away from the pool. The place is really just a parking lot with hook-ups. There's almost no trees unless you pay a small fortune for one of the few sites with one.

Fried eggplant appetizer was lacking is both flavor and ingenuity -- all I could taste was oil. Lamb kabobs -- the best stateside, according to one delusional reviewer -- just an utter joke. 5 tiny pieces of dry, overcooked and tasteless lamb, one of which was all cartilage. The accompanying salad was an Albertson's-grade ruffage melange. The other lamb rice dish was better, at least not super tough or bland, and the rice was alright, but the lentils were not cooked--like at all.

You also have to switch elevators while going from the garage to the hotel elevators. Our breakfast was included, but I would not have paid the $12 extra if it wasn't. It included the usual cereals, juice/milk/coffee, egg/sausage, some breads/croissants (found a random chocolate one in there?), yogurt, and canned fruit.

(At our age, we figure an hour was plenty and it was!  It's gets super tiring jumping!)  On the hour and the half, they blow their whistle reminding those who have finished their session that they time is up.  This is when they make everyone take a mini break on the sides until everyone who is supposed to be off is gone.

It's still very much in pursuit of the beautiful people, though the fact that they had \\\"all food under a fiver\\\" menus and a laughably easy pub quiz going, suggests that a less fabulous crowd is also welcome, at least during the week.\\n\\nThe cocktail menu was fairly rudimentary and full of the cosmos and French Martinis that more serious cocktail bars tend not to do anymore. I got the impression though that that's what they're trying for here, and the general lack of pretence in the atmosphere was quite refreshing. Even the staff were quite courteous and friendly, a trait practically unheard of round here.\\n\\nI'd probably steer away from the food, the low prices and fairly unappetising selection told me pretty much everything I needed.

When I got it, it was cold (okay...maybe lukewarm, but I was hungry and I had places I needed to be and didn't have time to send it back or I would have.)  One side was burnt, as in black.  How they didn't notice this when they artfully arranged it on my plate is beyond me.  Think...burnt toast and bananas.  I didn't finish it all, because honestly I didn't feel it was that great.  Later that night me and the man were hungry and decided to try out House of Blues also in Mandalay Bay, but it was closed.  It was late, we were hungry and didn't want to go searching. Raffles was a convenient choice for us, although eating in the same place twice in one day while in Vegas was really unaplealing to me.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to give a  place a second chance, I am not going to write a place off wihen I have one bad experience.  I work in a restaurant myself, I know, not every dining experience is going to be great, if you want that, then stay home.  So despite my lackluster breakfast, I thought okay I am going to give this another shot.   \\n\\nWe perused the menu and decided okay for a late dinner this might be okay.  Well they have a late night menu, which is NOT displayed (Late being like 10:30 pm) and so the items we wanted were not available.  Not cool, Raffles, not cool.  I love breakfast food, so I decided I would try an omelet, well done, as in not runny.  It was overdone, rubbery, dry and strangly runny on the inside.

Various classes throughout the day allow you to make the practice part of your life as often as you aim for.  indeed it is true what byi's instructors preach:  the hardest part of the class is showing up!  i appreciate this studio so much more than words convey.   even though bikram is done on a group level you internalize the ritual of getting ready for class, being present in class, even leaving class as personal.  i don't mind at all the notifications of other services and class times on holidays during savasana (byi offered classes on Easter Sunday - integral to bikramettes and their 30 day challenges) arriving to class with \\\"spare\\\" time to sit and lounge is not in the cards for me so it is during class time that i'm brought up to speed on what other programs or additional classes i may benefit from.  not once have i ever received the message as an infomercial as the message is short and brief between postures.   I appreciate the honor system when on occasion i've not prepared for class and ran low of hydration.  those few times i'm able to consume first pay later without feeling \\\"marked\\\" or hounded to bring in payment.  just hazarding a guess but IF byi had more room to develop the studio in terms of space then andrea probably would do so.  i'm ok with the quaintness of bathroom space.  if made too spacious a waiting area then it might take away from the focus which is to get in the classroom, set up bikram camp and to wait for it!  byi is functional/practical for the bikrami's wanting yoga.  i need space in the classroom, the diverse personalities of instruction (no microphone please) and consistency in operation.

The club itself is nice.  It has a nice decor and it's clean with comfy long sofas.\\n\\nThis is so mean but the girls are not attractive whatsoever, especially for a Saturday night.  When we walked in the door, the girl on the main stage looked like she was 5 months pregnant, her belly was so big.  The girl after her was so skinny, in a not cute way.  I'm not hating.  Even the guys in our group were like eww.  And the fell on the stage and ate sh*t.  My friend did get a lap dance from a girl with really nice long legs.  And we also chatted with this girl that had a great, athletic body.  Most athletic body I've ever seen on a stripper in my life (not that I've seen that many strippers).  \\n\\nI absolutely wouldn't go here again unless I absolutely had to i.e. used the limo service to go somewhere else and had to stop by Velvet Lion as justification.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: This restaurant was a great find!

We went here for new years, my wife's filet wasn't cooked right and mine was over done. They sent it back and it came back acceptable, but what really bothered us was some supposedly famous person was being extremely loud and annoying.

A couple of their guys are outright rude, and service has gone down the toilet.  What should have been an overnight repair issue became a three day without my car ordeal and when I got it back, it wasn't even done and I had to bring it back to force them to finish the fix and not only was their manager rude about it, he lied to me about how long it would take.\\n\\nToday I took my car in and there is a repair that I was told would take two hours.  I told them to go ahead and fix it, the guy on the phone responded \\\"okay.\\\"  Three hours later I call to see if it's ready and it is not.  They guy \\\"wasn't sure\\\" whether I wanted the fix or not.  He then lied to me about trying to call me back to verify whether I wanted the problem fixed.

My gps kept saying I was passing it, but I could not see it from the street (passed it from both directions).  I called, spoke with Chrissie or Kristy, who gave excellent directions.  It's located in the Atherton Mill parking lot where there are a bunch of other restaurants - closest is Ice House and is located next to/across from the Farmer's Market.  Now that I know where it is, I will be sure to not get lost and get there when the kitchen is still open to enjoy a full meal.\\n\\nApparently the location changed recently and some of their offerings are no more, such as the alkaline water which was a bummer.. but they have carbon filtered water, which i'm not familiar with.. have to research that one.  \\n\\nPeople hang out and lounge even after the kitchen is closed.. it's a really lax, hip, artsy, healthy atmosphere.. good vibes!  People were super helpful and approachable.  People just came right up to me and spoke, which was really nice.  Prices are super high though.. i've never in my life purchased a pint? (approximately) of fresh juice for over $10.. that is insane!  but.. I wanted to give them a shot and support their local business.. all organic and vegetarian.  I chose the juice with beets, kale, spinach, orange, lemon, ginger and... not sure if i'm forgetting something or not.  I'll be drinking it tomorrow at work.  Never had beets before, so it should be an interesting experience.

Well this upset the husband and they will never go back to any hooters nor will we and we generate ALOT of business for the owner of this location! \\n\\nFYI if he does this to customers who are married imagine what he does during business hours. If the owner wants to speak to our company he can BUT we will NOT take this review down. I debated about giving it a five star based on the previous servers; however, this manager needs to be reviewed on his conduct and probably more.

This came as a bit of a surprise even though we typically tip 18%-20% for their good service.

When we first arrived, 2 agents were both with different large families who were complaining about something. I waited in line for *45* minutes along with many other frustrated people. There were two \\\"managers\\\" on duty, or whatever they were just standing there looking like idiots. When we would ask them for help, keep in mind some people were just asking for new keys because they wouldn't work, they put us back in line and didn't apologize for anything. As I finally came up to the counter, the woman gave me a bitchy look as I asked her if she had any half day or special rates, (we were staying for 3 hours) and she snapped at me! THE RATE IS 80 DOLLARS, IF YOU WANT TO GET A CHEAPER RATE, BOOK AT HOTELS.COM. So my fiance went and called hotels.com, and after being on hold with them, walked back and was told that they don't do same day reservations since it was before 3 am. Went to sit back down and my daughter was screaming at the top of her lungs and throwing a fit. They kept staring at me, and did not care to help, after everyone had ending up walking away because of the wait. I am not impressed at all.

I had ordered a Grilled Vegetable Wrap that came with amazing fresh daikon fries along with a Leafy Green Berry Blast Smoothie and my husband ordered a Vegan Burger along with Delicious Tofu Fries with a Wellness Drink Smoothie.  Everything we had ordered was so tastey.  So we went again the very next day and I had ordered the same thing and my husband ordered the Vegan Pizza and Carrot Juice.  The smoothies are seriously really healthy and so refreshing!  We are not Vegans but wanted to try something different and healthier.  The cafe is set up very nicely with TVs.  The place is next to the gym LVAC where you will see a lot of fit people coming to eat after the gym, also we saw people on their laptops as well.  I give it 4 stars because the prices are pretty expensive.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: My family and I have been coming to Lorenzo's since they opened.  So, why only 3 stars?  After all of these years, I finally think I can write a justified review.  First I want to say that we love the Grandma's Pie..best in the city or maybe anywhere else.  If you notice, all of the previous reviews talk about the pizza.  So, I am going to talk about what they are not taking about..First - the wine is horrible.  I've suggested many times that they get better tasting wine and up their price.  Right now they charge $5 a glass for the worst tasting wine in the world.  It's gotten to the point, that if I'm in the mood for a drink with my pizza, I'm going to one of the other Ballantyne restaurants to have a good drink with dinner. Tonight we ordered the house salad.  Thinking back on the house salads recently, the tomatoes are not ripe and the lettuce is iceberg that is more white than green.  My son likes the kids spaghetti and meatball (one meatball), which is a good size for the child.  He also likes garlic knots.  These are not knots, they are pull apart rolls that have garlic and butter on them.  However, the sauce that comes with the garlic \\\"knots\\\" is very good.  Tonight we ordered the special, baked ziti with eggplant.  Unfortunately, while the ziti and eggplant may have tasted good..it was hard to tell since it was drenched in tomato sauce and one huge slab of mozzarella cheese.  The sauce was just ok and tasted like it was out of a jar with no seasoning.  How can you make a good sauce to go with the \\\"knots\\\" and not have good sauce on the ziti.  Thinking back to other entrees we have had, they were also drenched in sauce that could have been much tastier. We also had ordered the meatball parm sub.  This was done very nice - 6 medium size meatballs on a sweet soft roll.  So, to sum it up..if you are looking for a good pizza head to Lorenzos, but you'd better not want to have a good drink to go  a log with it..Just stick to pizza at Lorenzo's.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Terrible, tasteless food\\nChicken Asiago sandwich was bland, dry, tasteless.\\nChocolate ice cream cup melted\\nFrench fries over salted and cold\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Not a bad place, but I would go for a seat inside the restaurant.\\n\\nI visited Il Fornaio with a group of seven who were in from out of town.  For some reason they really wanted to sit on the \\\"patio\\\" which is really just the area outside of the main restaurant right next to the slot machines.  As you can imagine that made for a really loud meal and the main thing that kept me from rating Il Fornaio any higher.\\n\\nWe were here on a Sunday night, and had to wait about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  Like any Italian place, you get plenty of bread with vinegar and oil to tide you over while you decide on what to have.  I went for the margherita pizza, which was more than I could handle.  If I recall correctly it was in the 10-15 dollar range.  Most of the other entrees are a bit more pricey.  The wait staff was friendly but a little too attentive for my taste.  I don't need to be asked every 4 minutes if I'm ok, or have someone reach through my conversation to refill my water that's not even half gone.\\n\\nIf I go back here, I'll definitely get inside seating.

I could hear them in the back laughing it up while I was in the room frantic for my pet and all I hear were obscene language. These people don't care at all for you pet, even the doctor by the name of Baker is a real class act! He has no sympathy and no bed side manner and just treats you like another number. The receptionist with the bob Adriene I believe is over the top on fakeness and acts like she cares and understands what I was going through that night, plus she is very odd. Over all this review is not based on pricing because I would do anything for my pet money is no problem, it's the crappy staff that wear their \\\"I care for your pet\\\" hat like toilet paper stuck to your a$$. Seems this place has a huge turnover rate and staff that is completely incompetent. Do yourself a favor and go to Sonora Veterinary Specialist, they are right down the way on 40th St and Cactus and they are exceptionally better and educated. DON'T waste your time or money on VCA, this place is full of unprofessional slackers that rush you just to get you out and going. Idiots!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Overall, not that impressed. I've only been to one other buffet before, at the Bellagio, and I prefer that one over the Wynn. We went on a Tuesday night, after a long day of hiking at Zion National Park, so we were starving. To be honest, I didn't feel like the buffet was that big. I went back 2 times for a heaping of crab legs & shrimp cocktail, which are the only foods I really enjoyed there. They have some dim sum like dumplings and such at the Chinese food station, which was awful. Most of their cooked fishes were overcooked and not impressive. Their cheese ravioli in their pasta section was good, as was their miso soup.\\n\\nThey have a huge dessert section, but to be honest, none of the desserts really impressed me. One of my dining companions loved their coffee ice cream, as he is a big fan of coffee and it tastes very very strongly of coffee.\\n\\nI would not go to their dinner buffet again. Also, it is very pricy, comes to about $37 with tax per person. A friend of mine said their breakfast buffet was great though, and only $25, so would be willing to try that sometime.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Never had a bad experience.

For those looking, it's on the side near where B of A, Starbucks and is right next to Pizza Hut.  \\n\\nThe one thing I would change is the stark-white tables and chairs. Not a good mix with kids coming in. It seems to be becoming an industry standard with Fro-Yo places and this place is pretty sterile. The neon colored spoons are fun though and there is a wide variety of mix-ins to add to your Fro-Yo if you so desire.\\n\\nA piece of advice--I hope that Razzleberriez will remember--when the snowbirds leave, your best customers are going to be us residents and we have kids so don't forget to appeal and cater to us as well.

Obviously their theme is anything beach and Jimmy Buffet related. It's actually pretty neat on the inside. There's a section of booths that looks like the back of fishing boats. Their music is pumping for the party that's usually going on on their balcony most nights. Not terrible but it's a little distracting. Their margarita menu is large and the two we tried were well mixed. There was a lot of tequila but it didn't detract from the taste. That being said, the alcohol content did sneak up on us and we felt a little tipsy after one drink. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Next we had their chicken volcano nachos. This thing was huge and was clearly meant to serve more than two people. We picked at the plate for almost an hour and still had to take some of it back to our room. Admittedly after the drinks and appetizer we were done so we didn't have any dinner items. If you've never been I'd say give it a try. It's an expierience. However I don't think anyone would be clamoring to get back for another visit.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This place is HORRIBLE!!!\\n\\nInn-Termission Lounge is pretty much a dive bar in every aspect, except for drink prices. As noted in previous reviews, the drink prices would reflect those of an upscale club. Which this dump most definitely is not. As well, it's nearly impossible to get a drink from the bartenders. They will literally look right at you, and completely ignore you at the same time. Once you finally do get served (at one point, it took me 20 minutes to get a beer), it's like they've done you the biggest favor in the world by serving you. \\n\\nI have seen some places use increased drink prices to weed out \\\"riff-raff\\\". But it fails to work here. Countless homeless dregs wandered in and out of the place, right past the doorman. Then they hit total strangers up for a drink. I guess it's OK for them to come in, so long as they ask for drinks and not money? They also brought their dogs into the bar with them-which is a major PLCB violation. I was catching a show in the back room, and noticed a puddle on the floor. At first I thought someone spilled a drink. But then I saw that one of the homeless guys' dogs was squatting and urinating on the floor. Lovely. \\n\\nI like a good dive bar as much as the next guy.

Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.\\n\\nLast night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.\\n\\nI've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  \\n\\n4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. \\n\\nIf you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: reasonably priced with some decent options. Portion sizes were pretty good.

I requested the VIP service and added on the leather conditioning for the seats. I was in one lane and after specifying what wash/extras I wanted, someone else came over and said I could move to another lane where it'd be quicker since nobody was in that one. So I moved lanes and went inside to pay and wait. After I waited to pay (while the cashiers were just sitting in the back talking with each other as a line formed behind me), I noticed that whoever was supposed to be vacuuming my car, was on a phone and kind of glanced in my car while holding the vacuum hose then just shut my door and tossed down the hose. I assumed it was because they were done with that part of the service. \\n\\nThen, after my car went through the automated part of the car wash, I proceeded to wait outside and my car was parked behind 3 other cars to be finished. By the time mine made it to the front and was finishing up, I had been at the car wash for an hour. I've never been at a car wash for an hour! If I had know it'd take that long, I wouldn't have stopped. The times on the cars behind me showed that most had only been there about 15-20min at that point. Then, I asked about the trunk/storage area in the SUV, if it should have been vacuumed or not. The guy working on my car didn't know but the guy working on the car behind mine told him it should have been- that the whole car gets vacuumed. Well, it wasn't so he took a little blower to try to get the stuff out of the storage/trunk area and it didn't work very well. I also noticed that the windows/windshield weren't cleaned very well and I had black stuff on my rims after they \\\"cleaned\\\" them. And they only vacuumed the driver's floor mat- no place else in the car was vacuumed! Also the cup holders weren't wiped out. I didn't bring it to anyone's attention besides the two mentioned because I had already been there an hour and was just wanting to get out of there! Plus, I saw their \\\"answer\\\" for vacuuming my car that didn't work so I still wouldn't have been happy until they used a real vacuum on it. Will NEVER return!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Thank God for tourists and trendy people wanting trendy cupcakes. Without either this place would flop!!!\\n\\nI always see a line out the door and figured that Sprinkles cupcakes HAD to be amazing. I live right down the street and find myself walking by quite often, but after 3 visits and 3 mediocre cupcakes I realized why there is always a 15 minute wait; the teenagers that work behind the counter are ill trained and take longer to put a cupcake in a box, than it does Starbucks to make a complex specialty coffee.\\n\\nTo top it off, each time I visited, the overprices cupcakes were hardly stocked and I had to settle for my second choice. The cakes tasted decent but were a touch dry. \\nFun to look at but not much more.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I love cupcakes as much as the next 30's something hipster yuppie, but had it not been for an extraordinary location with a high volume of tourist based pedestrian traffic, Sprinkles would not be making it based on the quality of their cupcakes. It is a good thing for them that everyone that walks by this location is transient. The idea is great but this company would not survive on local business alone.\\n\\nThe owners are very fortunate that they have been able to ride the coattails of other trendy and worthy cupcake companies. Had the cupcake trend not existed before Sprinkles opened, they surely would not have started the trend themselves, and would have fizzed out within months of opening\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I was nervous when we got there because the French place next to it was packed and this place was pretty empty.

The haircut came off without a hitch, #1 buzz all over, but the shave was a bit lacking.\\n\\nHonestly I felt like he was a bit rushed during the shave and I didn't come away as smooth as I thought I should. When I get home there was visible stubble and several longer hairs that he'd missed all together. I had to break out my razor and finish up the job he'd started when I got home.\\n\\nI would return for a haircut, clipper cut's aren't tough, but I would hesitate to get a shave from the same gentleman in the future. For $40 for a shave and a haircut I think you should come away smooth as a baby's butt and not look like you have trucker stubble in patches on your face and neck.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: First, I have been a customer of Tags since the 59 ave and Bell restaurant opened.  I have seen the evolution of this family owned restaurant and then their expansion in opening two other Tags in the valley.  The poor rating I have to unfortunately give Tags has not been my experience until recently, say the past year or so.  Much of their problem I think can be reduced to poor managment and consequently poor oversight and customer service.  The past three experiences I have had at Tags have left me wondering if I will return again.  On one occasion I ordered a margarita and was delivered what is called a tag margarita, something that was not what I wanted nor ordered.  The waitress told me that this particular drink was the only type of margarita they offered, for 8.95.  I got the impression, rightly or wrongly that this was an attempt by the waitress to pad the bill.  I later went to the bar and asked the barmaid if they did in fact make a traditional margarita to which she told me they did.  On this particular occasion I ordered their Romano Chicken dish and was served an entirely different chicken item.  The server realized the mistake once she placed the meal in front of me.  Then my wife found a hair in her meal that she ordered.  I normally would chalk all this up to simply a bad experience that needed to be weighted against all the previously good experiences we had had at Tags.  \\n\\nMy wife and I again returned to Tags about a month ago, hoping that things may have improved.  I think it is the one establishment that we would give second, third and fourth chances to.  We sat on the patio and ordered a half order appetizer of their calamari.  It was obvious to us that the portion size was considerably smaller then on previous visits, as we normally would order the calamari appetizer.  When our orders arrived again, I did not receive what I had ordered.  When the waiter placed my meal in front of me, I asked him what I had ordered.   He said, \\\" Penne noodle, rustic roma sauce, and it looks like...hhhhmmm...meat?\\\"  The poor guy couldnt even read his own writing, so I guess I cant fault the kitchen staff for making the wrong meal.  I had ordered a pasta bowl of penne nooodles, rustic roma sauce and mozzerella cheese.  He asked if I would have liked to send it back, but my wife already had her meal and had I sent it back she would have been done by the time my meal was served.  There was no offer of taking the meal off the check or getting the manager to visit our table to see how things were.  Again, I think this goes back to some management issues with this particular restaurant.  Due to Tags expansion, many of the more proactive managers, Rhonda being my favorite, were sent to the newer restaurants to manage them.  Unfortunately that has left  the 59th Ave Tags with a manager that is not proactive in his customer service nor congenial in nature.  It seems that this is reflected in much of the staffs attitudes also.  \\n\\nIt is my hope that Tags will return to its previous place as one of our favorites, but I wont be one that will hold my breath until that happens.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: So go here once just to say you have gone, but it's not that exciting.

I took it through the wash and when they were done wiping it down, the glass repair guy who was affiliated with this car wash told me I had a crack in my windshield. I drove this van every day and knew there was no crack, but I thought there might be a possibility that it may have happened that day and I just did not notice this dime sized crack right in front of my face.\\n\\nSo the kid from Romania told me he could give me a great deal at $80. I told him no that i was selling it and I was not going to spend a penny more on it. He did not want to lose money so he brought it down to $60, then $40, then $35. I repeated that i would not spend money on it. He gave me an offer of $25 so I accepted and told him that i would use him in the future if I have any windshield repair work.\\n\\nWhile he was repairing my windshield he realized I was a locksmith and asked me if  I would make him a key to his mid-90's Honda Civic. I remembered it very well with super dark tint, primered and appeared it would was being prepped for painting. \\n\\nWhen he finished he asked me for my name/number/ADDRESS for the invoice. I found that odd since I was paying cash. He assured me it was standard policy and I would not receive spam calls or mail.\\n\\nA week later after I purchased my new Chevy Express van, I was in the front of my house and noticed this same kid driving his Honda Civic by my house that appeared to be looking for an address. He came to a stop 1 house past mine and looked at me and then took off abruptly.\\n\\nThe next day I was on my way to a job and noticed a crack in the windshield on a van with less that 200 miles on it. Immediately I suspected this kid from Romania who also works with a bunch of family members that own the company. He must have done it at night under the cover of darkness.\\n\\nI called the 16 st location and revealed my suspicions who in turn told me to call the owner at another location. When I spoke with the owner he thought it was the most absurd thing he had ever heard. He conveniently disconnected from the call and when I called back it went to voicemail.\\n\\nI had a large credit on my prepaid card so I was going to use it and had gone back for another wash and spoke with the manager. I told her my story and she assured me she knew this family and that she trusted them and that they would never do such a thing. I had no proof so I could only argue my case to a certain extent without sounding crazy.\\n\\nThe next time I had gone back the Romanian kid was there and I was cleaning the mess out of the cab so it could be vacuumed. I was throwing everything valuable in a  plastic bag to sort out later and had a trash can to throw the junk away, so I know this kid never examined my windshield.. I WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM DOING SO..\\n\\nThe kid walks up from behind the back of the van and told me that I had a crack in my windshield. I just glared at him for about 5 seconds without saying anything and told him not to worry about it. There are two things that made this kid guilty. 1) like I mentioned before I would have seen him examining the windshield if he did. So the ONLY  way for him to know if there was a crack is if he did it himself. 2) If he had examined my windshield he would have noticed that it had ALREADY BEEN REPAIRED. That's how I know for sure he did it, but still I had no proof.\\n\\nI had let my van go a couple months without washing it and the next time I came in I asked a random worker what happened to the Romanian (windshield  repair) family. The worker told me they were being watched due to other customers who were suspicious and that he was caught with a spring loaded punch cracking a windshield. So the owner let them go....\\n\\nAfter all that you would think they would apologize and give me some credits to make up for it, but they did not.\\n\\nThe last straw for me was when the Ultimate car wash did not appear to give a wax coat along with the appearance of the machine and worker not doing a thorough job of cleaning. When I asked if I could take it through again the kid gave me a hard time.  After taking it through a second time I noticed bird dropping that were still there so I just took it upon myself to finish the job myself.\\n\\nI'm glad I only have a few dollars left on my prepaid card. Since I have no reason to go back, I will be finding a new car wash from now on.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Yet again I am disappointed with Arizona's selection of ethnic food.

Wasn't too hungry so we got the 2 appetizers and a main dish: Ahi Tuna Sliders, Mac & Cheese Balls, and the BLT Sandwich. \\n\\nThe sliders were alright. The ahi tuna was not the greatest because it wasn't entirely fresh. The sliders were also super DINKY! 3 sliders for $20? rip off..... It sort of lacked a certain taste I was looking for. Almost too savory! \\n\\nThe Mac & Cheese Balls were okay. Clever! Fried balls with mac & cheese in the middle? Once again it was like 3 balls for like $15. \\n\\nThe sandwich was pretty good! Took a bite out of it and it was HUGE! Almost too hard to bite into. The fries were addicting! But then again you can't really mess up on fries. \\n\\nTheir fancy goblet drinks are what makes this place known. If I had a bigger appetite that day, I probably would've opted for an actual meal with a drink! Like Serendipity 3, I think I even saw some frozen drinks! \\n\\nThis place is cool because it is open 24/7! A nice classy place like this always open? Plus!

Thankfully, i spent 3 days at the lovely Golden Nugget downtown, and will be frequenting that casino and its downtown sistas & bruthas whenever I come to vegas from now on. does that mean i'm getting old, or does that mean i've finally wised up to the sheer pretentiousness that often occurs on-strip? who knows...one thing i can assure you of is that i will stay away from aria's nasty ass face. no matter how cool that one button control is.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Red Lobsters Biscuits is what drives me to dine at their restaurant. However, now that they sell their brand of biscuits at Costco, I fail to see why I would ever dine here again. \\n\\nI love seafood. It's my favorite food. However, Red Lobster seems to think that the best way to cook a good seafood dish is to drown it in garlic and butter. My goodness, it's ridiculous how much butter and oil is used in any given dish. I am (was) a huge fan of their Salmon New Orleans. It came with wild rice, broccoli, broiled salmon and shrimp covered in a tabasco butter sauce. I always got the sauce on the side because again, the add too much butter/oil. Since the dish is super easy to make, I decided to make it on my own with less butter. Viola! Dish turned out better than Red Lobster (IMO which is very bias I will admit) For what you pay to get a good meal, the food is very average while being coated in nothing but butter. Even the salads are iffy. \\n\\nTheir food is nothing special. The most decent cooker can make anything on their menu. I never understood why the lines are always out of the damn door when I drive by on a weekend. Convenience? Must be.

Dessert, was also pretty good. Anyway, there isn't much to say aboutets.\n: neutral\n\n: Not good at all!! The meat was flavorless and the salsa was water down.

I had ordered a Grilled Vegetable Wrap that came with amazing fresh daikon fries along with a Leafy Green Berry Blastie and my husband ordered a Vegan Burger with Delicious Tofu Fries with a Wellness Drinkie.  Everything we had ordered was so tastey.  So we went again the next day and I had ordered the same thing and my husband ordered the Vegan Pizza and Carrot Juice.  The smoothies are seriously really healthy and so refreshing!  We are not Vegans but wanted to try something different and healthier.  The cafe is set up very nicely with TVs.  The place is next to the gym LVAC where you will see a of fit people coming to eat after the gym, also we saw people on their laptops as well.

They need to do something about all the duck poo everywhere though, gross.\n:\n\n: It's a Valley staple. It's not the best, but it could be much, much worse. I make it here about once a year. The place is usually packed. The decor is bizarre. Thearitas are good. The chips and salsa are pretty damn good. The food ish. The service is always friendly.\n: neutral\n\n: If I could give this place a ZERO I would. DO NOT go to VCA Paradise Valley emergency because all they about is the money not your pets. they have a motto about their priority are the pets and customer service excellence, that's a joke! There is a tech there by name of Lindy who is condescending and acts like she cares, and rushes everything. I could hear them in the back laughing it up while I was in the room frantic for my pet and all I hear were obscene language. These people't care all for you pet, even the doctor by name of Baker is a real class act! He has no sympathy and no bed side manner and just treats you like another number. The receptionist with the bob Adriene I believe is over the top on fess and acts like she cares and understands what I was going through that night, plus she is very odd. Over all this review is not based on pricing because I would do anything for my pet money is no problem, it's the crappy staff that wear their \\\"I care for your pet\\\" hat like toilet paper stuck to your a$$. Seems this place has a huge turnover rate and staff that is completely incompetent. Do yourself a favor and go to Sonora Veterinary Specialist, they are right the way on 40th St and Cactus and they are exceptionally better and educated. DON'T waste your time or money onCA, this place is of unprofessional slackers that rush you just to get you out and going. Idots!\n: terrible\n\n: Never had a bad experience.

It's no secret that I'm a big Froo fan and this spot, though a bit to find amid all the hubub of the big strip mall off Bell and Grand, is definitely worth the visit. Froo is fresh tasting with great flavor combinations to from. For those looking, it's on the side near where B of A, Starbucks and is right next to Pizza Hut. n\\nThe one thing I would change is the stark-white tables and chairs. Not a good mix with kids coming in. It seems to be becoming an industry standard with Fro-Yo places and this place is pretty sterile. The neon coloredons are fun though and there is a wide variety of mix-ins to add to your Froo if you so desiren\\nA of advice--I hope that Razzleberriez will remember--when the snowbirds leave, your best customers are going to be us residents and we have kids so't forget to appeal and to us as well. We'll be loyal to you if you are to us!\n: good\n\n: Margarille is connected to theo Hilton and opens up right out onto the Strip. Obviously their theme is anything beach and Jimmyet related. It's actually pretty neat on the inside. There's a section of booths that looks like the back of fishing boats. Their music is pumping for the party that's usually going on on their balcony most nights. Not terrible but it's a little distracting. Theirarita menu is large and the two we tried were well mixed. There was a lot ofquila but it'tact from the taste. That said, the alcohol content did up on us and we felt a littley after one drink. Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing. Next we had their chicken volcanoos. This thing was huge and was clearly meant to serve more than two people. We picked at the plate for almost an hour and still had to take some of it back to our room. Adly after the drinks and appetizer we were done so we didn't have any dinner items. If you've never been I'd say give it a try. It's an expierience. However I't think anyone would be clamoring to get back for another visit.\n: neutral\n\n: Super loud sports bar.

Without either this place would flop!!!\\n\\nI always see a line out door and figured thatles cupcakes be amazing. I live right the street and find myself walking by quite often, but after 3 visits and 3 mediocre cupcakes I realized why there is always a 15 minute wait; the teenagers that work the counter are ill trained and take longer to put acake in a box, than it does Starbucks to make a complex specialty coffee\\nTo top it off, each time I visited, the overprices cupcakes were hardly stocked and I had to settle for my second choice. The cakes tasted decent but were a touch dry.nFun to at but not much moren\\n't get wrong, I love cupcakes as next 30's something hipsterpie, but had it not been for an extraordinary location with a high volume of tourist based pedestrian traffic,les would not be making it based on the quality of their cupcakes. It is a good thing for them that everyone that walks by this location is transient. The idea is great but this company would not survive on local business alonen\\nThe owners are very fortunate that they have been to ride the of other trendy and worthy cupcake companies.

Yet,  I found out later that the other place was BYOB. We were away by how perfectly cooked our meat was. We had atignon and another cut I can't remember. The potatoes we had on side were a gratin that was incredible. \\n\\nOn of it all, the restaurant is located on a quaint street good for people watching.

We were seated for about 10 minutes before anyone came by to say hi.  We had some salads and burgers and we were here for over an hour.  This is not a fine dining establishment, and we were not loitering.  My burger came out with no fries.  Nothing, just a burger on a plate, and no one thought \\\"Hey, that looks funny.\\\"\\n\\nAnd it wasn't just us!  The couple seated next to us sat down about 15 minutes after we did.  They probably sat for 15 minutes before anyone came to take their orders.  They got a couple beers about 15 minutes later, and by the time we left, they STILL had no food in front of them!  We told our waiter when we left that these poor people had been completely ignored all night, and we hoped that would maybe get some attention to them.  For all I know, they're still sitting there silently, waiting for someone to give them some food.\\n\\nThe food was fine, but not in a million years would I come back here to be disrespected and ignored just to have a burger and fries.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I took my Mom here for her birthday in December... I know, I'm late in reviewing. I'm originally from Boston and living in AZ I find good seafood at an affordable price is hard to find. \\nMy Mom and I split one of the seafood buckets.... the Boston one of course! It included lobster, clams, corn and sausage - it was the perfect size to please us both for dinner and I think it was priced fairly.\\nWe enjoyed our meal and the staff occassionally broke out into song and dance which kept it lively and gave us a good chuckle too. It's not a fancy place by any means but so far one of the better places I've enjoyed for seafood here in AZ. Go in with a fun attitude and you'll enjoy yourself as much as we did.\\nNow if they could only open one of these places in N. Scottsdale or Phoenix...\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Seemed like fun and a great idea. We love good German food and let's just say that we could not say that we got any. Very overpriced, we ordered one combo platter one cheese spaetzl dish, 2 deserts to go ($10 each) and 1 cocktail and soda. Total was almost $90. Another negative, This place is listed as good for kids and I must say that even with my 7 & 9 yr old who love to be around music and noise, but this place is unbearably loud. Can't even talk to one another or hear the waitresses, and I'm not exaggerating either. My kids looked like they were drowning in the noise, both were slumped in their seats almost falling asleep because of the disturbing noise of drunkenness surrounding this large room of hoorah and screaming. You literally feel trapped. Women were being spanked with paddles by the employees, while men cheered on. I wish I could say I enjoyed some kind of aspect here since I insisted on going here and really looked forward to the experience, but instead I felt like a horrible mother and completely ripped off. Never again. \\n\\nMaybe perfect for a fraternity get together, but not for us.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Its in the Harris Teeter Parking Lot . Lots of Parking. Great \\\"Real\\\" Italian Food.  Dinner was Excellent. Server made the Evening. Rolls were perfect.  Pasta that melted in your mouth. This is great for Families and Date Night. Do get there early it fills up fast.  Has Outdoor Patio as well\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Craving something different from the usual Indian takeaways I usually go for, I decided to try out Jade Palace, as it is located right next to my girlfriend's flat.  \\n\\nMy main experience of Chinese food has been courtesy of Jimmy Chung's and as this is pretty much mass produced, I expected something a little different from Jade Palace. However, I was disappointed.  The cantonese style  sweet and sour I had was certainly nothing to get too excited about and the friend rice I had alongside was also fairly unspectacular, although still fairly nice to eat.  The prawn crackers were also very similar to those that I could buy from the supermarket for about half the price.  \\n\\nThe saving grace was the curry sauce and noodles that my girlfriend ordered.  The curry sauce was deliciously smooth and not grainy as is often the case. The noodles proved to be jammed tight into the foil container, and as a result the portion was very generous. The prices seemed fairly standard: they did not strike me as particularly cheap but they also did not make my jaw drop to the floor as other Chinese takeaways have done.  \\n\\nOverall, if you're nearby and are desperately craving a bit of Chinese takeaway, this is fine. However, if possible, shop around first to avoid too much disappointment.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Over priced,low grade food. Owner moody and miserable.

Too bad i showed up off-season for craw fish, but other than that, it was total class.  \\nThey seated me and my friend in the corner but we end up having a great view of the place, and seemed a bit more intimate that way. This also gave us a great view of the outside seating area to people watch as well.\\nThe food itself was very rich and delicious.  I don't remember the name of the dish but it featured baked oysters.  Every bite was delicious.\\nI am definitely coming back there if I am looking for a nice seat down in the West Valley.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The only reason I ever come to this mall is because it happenes to be close to work for me.

It also smells funny even though it seems to be pretty clean.\\n\\nI will say that this season I found some cute bathing suits on sale at Macy's but you can go to any mall in the valley and find the same thing.\\n\\nBonus that fiesta doesnt ever seem to be THAT busy when I'm there during the week in the middle of the day.  \\n\\nOther than a very few positive points, I'd go elsewhere for a memorable and successful shopping experience.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: My Mexican food standards are pretty high and everyone SWORE by this place so I finally tried it a few months ago.  If I'm going to suffer the plight of diarrhea, I'd at least like some flavor to make it worth it.  I would truly prefer eating frozen burritos over this place.  \\n\\nI'd also like to know who provided this restaurant with a single dollar sign.  I paid $12 for a soft tortilla on the bottom of my taco salad, bland meat and sparse, tasteless cheese sprinkled on top with a side of the nastiest salad dressing I've ever had.  Oh, and a small drink cup.\\n \\nI had to shout my order across the noise to the person making my order and could barely hear the questions being asked.  I might have verbally agreed to the assassination of someone being held hostage in the kitchen, I'll never know.   Normally, that sort of thing doesn't bother me with this style of  restaurant (the shouting, not assassination), but this was worse than a bar on a Saturday night hosting 5 21st birthday parties.\\n\\nAnd the atmosphere?  Kids everywhere, kids screaming and kids dropping their food and crying. I'm not a kid person, but the parent to child ration was 1:3 and that could shake anyone trying to eat lunch.  The tables were so close together you had to ask the guests behind you to scoot forward so you could get out and the tables were built around the waiting line so the people in line had the pleasure of watching you eat and you had the pleasure of being uncomfortable.\\nI could go on and on, but you get the gist of it.  \\n\\nEvery offer for free lunch to this place has been declined every since that first visit, I will never eat there again.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Ate with a large party, so only saw limited menu. Steaks were excellentt, had Filet, very tender. Vegetables were slathered in butter, kind of nasty. Caesar's Salad very good, nice tasty anchovies on the side.

It's just a little, I don't know... old and out of shape.  It was cool before, but on my last stay I started noticing small things like slightly peeled wallpaper and less than great decor.\\n\\nWith all the new hotels around The Strip, this place needs a major upgrade plan if it wants to stay competitive.  Otherwise it's heading down the road to being just another cheap outdated LV hotel/casino.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Love the Lobster enchiladas; not on the menu, special item usually Saturdays.

I came to this establishment with three guests. \\n\\nThe decor was nice. The atmosphere was quiet. I believe we were one of two tables being served on this particular night. \\n\\nMy party and I all tried a shrimp dish, which was one of their specials. The flavor was good.\\n\\nService was slow, especially since it was a fairly slow night. \\n\\nThe next morning, all of my friends were sick, as was I. Coincidence? Perhaps. \\nOr it could have been the shrimp.\\n\\nIt will take me a while to gain the courage to give George's a second try. Right now, I can't even think about it without feeling nauseous. \\n\\nLuckily, it seems like this was perhaps a fluke, for some of my other friends have had good experiences here. No restaurant is perfect.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Worst dinning experience I have had of that caliber. We went there three of us here late on a Friday night for our pre-party grub. \\n\\nOur waiter, which I'm glad I had forgotten his name already, had the worst attitude. We asked him to suggest items on the menu and he was pressuring to order items he suggested standing over the table, and wouldn't leave until we asked for a couple of minutes. \\n\\nThe kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life. \\n\\nThe food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas. \\n\\nMost overrated, perhaps the only redeeming factor to this place, which got us in there in the first place is its decorative interior, but don't be fooled, it's got nothing to live up to it.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: We had a delicious meal. The ambiance was very nice. The tables were a little close together. Our bus boy Sean was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  Jason was our server who was also very attentive   The general Johnny stopped by our table and when we praised Sean and told him how much we enjoyed the food he promised to bring his business card. So we could call him for future reservations. He disappeared and that was the last we saw of him.  Sean services was the most positive aspect of the meal.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I'm a big fan of good ribs and this place fell short of good ribs. The price wasn't bad because of the $10 for $20 coupon I bought on Yelp but they quality just wasn't there.

I do want to say the service was good though.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This restaurant originated in Heber.  I spent lots of time up here as a teenager, and Heber brings back lots of good memories, so I liked this place before I ever set foot in the door, and when I did, oh my.  \\n\\nThis place is fan freakin tastic.  Food was great, service was great,  there was even a mariachi band on Saturday night.  \\n\\nThe amount of food you get, we both had another meal the next day.  We both got the taco, cheese enchilada and red burrito plate that comes with rice and beans.   Red chili meat was plentiful, very tender and tasty.  Taco had lots of tender juicy shredded beef.  But the best part of this plate was the cheese enchilada.  OMG it was good.  The enchilada sauce was definitely homemade.  I plan to go back to this place soon.   Rice and beans were good too.  Hot sauce was very spicy, and they had another option that wasn't as spicy too.  And we both got a soda.  Bill was under $27.  \\n\\nI'm serious, try it.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I am for Chuck box  being a great place. First of all .

Wished there would haven been outdoor seating.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Debating to write a review about this one, but people has the right to know what other people think of the place.  Giving this a 2 star might be to generous. \\n\\nLocated off Decatur and Ann in the corner of the Smith Parking lot, is a bar and grill called Bilbo's.  The place looks nice on the outside, it is decent on the inside.  But kind of felt a bit awkward coming in, since there was no one to really greet us and wasn't really much of a sign to either wait, or take our own seats.  So we just sat to the closest table that was near the door.  The table itself was kind of sticky, I was contemplating to move to the table next to us but didn't want to be rude.  \\n\\nThe waitress finally came over after a long while, to give us a menu, which there was very little to choose from.  The wife and I, mainly had the same thing and thought the food was at least edible.  Wasn't great, but edible enough to eat.  Refills on drinks were slow as well.  What kind of got me is that, the place wasn't as busy and it took a long time to be checked upon.  Mainly, if it takes more than 15 minutes to check up on some people, that's way to long I believe.  I can probably understand if they're busy, but 2-3 people in the bar, 2 other couples at the booth.  Shouldn't take a waitress long to check on people.  I'm sure it may be lack of staffing and other situations, but lack of customer service doesn't help the business.  \\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't come here again, but if you end up going, it's probably good for beers at the bar, where there should be some one there majority of the time.  I wouldn't suggest to eat there cause it looks like they don't clean their tables very well.  But if you really have no other choice, don't expect much from it.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Extremely caring practice. The doctors and staff are very good with our kids.

Once in August for Sunday Brunch and once for the Monday brunch after Christmas. From what I remember, the Sunday brunch in August was SO much better than the Monday Brunch.

I made a two-night reservation for a business trip, but I was stranded in an airport overnight because of cancelled flights. I called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to change my reservation, but the receptionist was not having it. She was completely unsympathetic to my plight and insisted me to pay for the night that I'm not staying. Eventually, I had to get my project manager to resolve this issue. \\n\\nBoth the room and the lobby were not spacious, although that's understandable given that the hotel was in downtown. What's not understandable was the creaking floor throughout the hotel floor, which amplified no matter how light my steps were. Good thing that I was not living below night owls, but that would not matter because the AC unit was too loud to get a good sleep anyway. Why would a Marriott hotel have an AC unit that's louder than my grandma's AC unit from the 1980s is completely beyond me.\\n\\nSeriously reconsider if you decide to live here. Aside from sub-par room and service that are unusually low by the Marriott standard, note that the only available parking nearby will escalate the unjust price that you have to pay to stay in this hotel.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Ive brought a bunch of pants and jeans I bought from Nordstrom here to be hemmed and couldn't tell that they weren't factory hems.

I love good frybread so I was excited to see what this place had to offer.  I was sadly disappointed.\\n\\nI tried the Dev's chicken dish and my girlfriend tried another dish that I can't recall the name of.  I really can't believe that what came out was the standard that this place goes by.  The frybread itself wasn't bad but was pretty bland.  The rest of the stuff on top was even more bland than the frybread.  There were way too many refried beans on this thing and I think I got half of a head of lettuce on top of that.  I think there was chicken buried in there somewhere but it sure didn't taste like it.  There was absolutely no flavor to this thing which is impressive because the ingredients should have come together nicely (should have...but didn't).  I even tried to spice it up with the hot sauce they gave us and that had no flavor either.  My girlfriend didn't fare any better as her meal looked and tasted like a full can of refried beans and the other half of the head of lettuce that ended up on mine.\\n\\nShortly after we had begun eating some guy came out from the kitchen and asked if everything was ok.  The way he asked it though indicated that he was trying to see if he had made it correctly rather than simply seeing if we were enjoying the meal.  It was so awful that I simply didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was some of the worst food I have ever had.\\n\\nPlease understand that I do not consider myself a food snob or anything like that.  This meal simply was poorly done and had zero taste to it.  I got through half of it and had to throw the rest away...and I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I was really hungry.  I also tried one of their house juice drinks that they had available.  The peach-melon sounded tasty.  It wasn't.

Once she did, she asked if we were ready to order, and seemed disappointed when we only ordered drinks.  Drinks delivered, and we ordered pizza.  She never once checked on us to see how we were doing - it was 1) take drink order (and be disappointed because we didn't have food order ready) 2) take food order, deliver food and 3) bring check (at which point I asked for another beer - and missed happy hour because of the delay.

When the doctor came in he looked at my foot for a minute and said that it was probably a blood clot and I needed an ultrasound. A few minutes later a nurse comes in telling me to sign a form so I can be transfered to the ER at UMC, WTF? So I asked if that was really neccessary and she said yes so off I went. Got to the ER at about 8:30 pm and didn't leave until 3:40 am! The waiting room wasn't even that full but I was out there for 2 hours before they called me back and then was sent back out again, this happened a few times. I was finally called back and taken for my ultrasound around 12:15 but I didn't even realize that was where I was going till they parked me in the hall outside the ultrasound room, then I had to wait because no one had the paperwork for me. When the ultrasound was done they came and wheeled me to a room and then just left me with no explanation about what was coming next, oh and the guy pushing me said he would go get my husband but he never did, I had to get up and ask a nurse if he could come back since he didn't know what was goin on with me at that point. So got to the room and waited and waited and finally after about an hour a doctor comes in (doesn't tell me his name or anything) and starts asking me what is wrong, hello isn't that on my chart at this point, but ok I go through the story again and he says that it probably isn't a blood clot but he will have to look at the ultrasound and then *poof* he is gone and never to be seen again. After another 1.5 hours I'm really tired and getting really pissed off so I look for a nurse to ask what is going on and when I find one she asks me if the doctor is discharging me!?! How the hell would I know, so I tell her I haven't seen the doctor for 1.5 hours and last I heard he was supposed to be reviewing my ultrasound. She says she will go check with him, yeah you do that, so I go and sit and wait and then another nurse comes in and tells me to sign the discharge paperwork. Ummm so what the hell is going on with my foot, \\\"Oh there's no blood clot but you knew that\\\", so I ask how the hell am I supposed to know that if no one tells me. So fine what is wrong with my foot and what do I do to get it small enough to fit into a shoe again? She literally shoves a prescription for 800mg ibuprofean in my face and says take that and keep it elevated. At this point I am either going to start crying or hitting people so I just take the paper work and leave since it is now 20 to 4am and I have to be at work by 9. \\n\\nThis is the absolute worst health care experience I have ever had and I just pray that neither I nor any of my loved ones have a true emergency and get sent to this hospital.

After seeing a physician, whose treatment was not effective, I saw Dr. Vaughn after reading his reviews on Yelp.\\n To make a long story short, I got in promptly and he gave me advice on how I might possibly avoid an injection into my foot, which advice I very much appreciated.  That advice helped, but did not resolve the problem so I returned for the usually unpleasant steroid injection.  Let me tell you, I never felt the injection or the manipulation of the needle.  A great experience and I believe that my problem is over.I would very highly commend Dr. Vaughn  to my friends.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I visited The Living Room tonight for the first time after hearing a lot about it from several of my friends. Upon approach I noticed the exterior is well kept and seems classy; when you walk in, it's spacious with a a very nice, warm decor (evidently it was recently remodeled and it looks great). The atmosphere is very inviting.\\nI sat down with my friends at the community high top table in the center and we were greeted almost immediately, from that point on the service went down. We informed the young lady that greeted us that we weren't sure which wine we'd like yet so we would take water for the time being. The water never came but by the time she returned we were ready to order wine and appetizers. \\nThe bruschetta, sliders, and the pretzel we ordered came out very quickly (we actually ordered them all at separate times throughout the evening and each time the quick delivery time was equally impressive).\\nThe biggest problem was finding a server to even notice that we needed to order food and/or drinks. Each time our glasses sat empty, pushed off to the side for a minimum of 5 minutes before anyone would even acknowledge us and inquire as to whether or not we would like more, despite the fact that we were constantly being passed by servers. The servers seem to share the entire restaurant and I think that creates confusion as to who has or has not been helped; they just assume that someone else is taking care of you.\\n\\nTo recap, I'll just say that the food was delicious, much better deserving of a four star rating, and their wine selection was equally good. The service, however, is a major detractor and in my opinion is the most important part of any good dining experience. As Benjamin Franklin said, \\\"The handshake of the host, determines the flavor of the roast,\\\" and I've had much better service at Postino's or D-Vine.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Super busy and unhappy waiters \\n\\nFood comes nothing like their pictures on the Manu.

More iced tea delivered even before a glass was empty. Owners help deliver the food, and all servers seemed to be doing a very effective job. \\n\\nThe other thing I liked is that the server told us what the special of the evening was, instead of assuming that we saw it on the board, on our way in. Many restaurant servers \\\"assume\\\" that you know what the specials are, and don't bother telling you.\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't rate this 5 stars was because we all asked that the garlic butter sauce be left off of the salmon. Two of the 3 dishes came with the sauce on the salmon. The server was very apologetic and offered to take them back, but the 2 people kept it. \\n\\nWe'll definitely be back.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I emailed this letter to the store;\\n\\nHello:\\n\\nYesterday afternoon I found myself in the unfortunate position of being 350 miles from my studio without a piece of equipment.  While I was driving into Phoenix from Los Angeles,I realized we had left a posing stool. We called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one. We were told yes. We then set a course to come to your store immediately.  Unfortunately, coming from CA we didn't realize you we're 1 hour aead of us.  We called once the realization hit. We had 75 minutes to travel 60 miles.  We made every effort to arrive by 6:00, as we were told rather rudely, that the store was closing at 6 sharp.  At 5:55, from about 4 blocks away, we called again and asked if they could ready our purchase, that we would run in and buy. We were told NO, that we better arrive before 6, that \\\"You have 4 minutes\\\".  I cannot begin to express the frustration and anger that your store couldn't accommodate a simple request, and was completely unsympathetic to the fact that we were driving straight from LA to you.  In fact, I arrived at 6:00 on the dot, as Randy I believe was locking the door.  He could have cared less. While part of me says, \\\"the people who run this store don't care about anything, why write this email\\\", as a business owner and potential customer, you deserve to know why I will make it my personal mission on every review site, website etc to let other potential customers know, just how much you value our business.\\n\\nI have never been treated like that by any company or vendor, and as a fellow business owner, I'm appalled by the blatant attitude and disrespect. I don't know any other company who wouldn't have gladly tried to help us or offered a solution acceptable to both.\\n\\nI wish your business luck for the future.

But sadly, I could not love you. You are just outdone by all the other $8-$10/meal sandwich places in uptown.

Because that's what I want to do, gulp down some coffee in the middle of eating my sandwich.  Alas, Brad, I think your days might be numbered if something doesn't change. Sandwiches are serious business.\\n\\nThat being said, the staff and sandwich makers are very friendly, and when I went, they were still working out some kinks (I think it was like the 3rd day you were open), and someone messed my stuff up, so I got my sandwich for free, so that's why you get 3 stars.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: A real hole in the wall joint in a gravel lot - What this place lacks in aesthetics it makes up in price and quality. \\n\\nThe price is pretty comparable to Chipotle and Filibertos and they have a pretty decent amount of choices on their menu.

Overall the food was good, nothing spectacular.  We went on a Friday evening and with a full house, the place was pretty noisy such that my fiance felt like he was shouting at me.  We are really excited to have them in the neighborhood and hope they get everything worked out soon.\\n\\nSo first, our orders were messed up, we got the wrong mussels (Horseradish instead of bacon blue cheese) and as it turns out, the Horseradish mussels were not good. I'm known to protect mussel broth from being cleared until every last bit is sopped up into crusty french bread, and this recipe allowed the bread to stay put in the basket.  When we asked about it because we tasted no bacon, the waiter said, \\\"oh yes, that's right you did order the bacon ones.  Do you want that taken off your bill?\\\"  Awkward....\\n\\nSecond,   we ordered pasta dishes and the waiter made a point of recommending linguine, which was fine because pasta shapes weren't listed on the menu and we never would have thought of requesting a particular one.  What made this strange was that when we asked him about it when both our dishes came out wrong, he told us the kitchen was serving whatever pasta they could put out quickest and was that okay with us.  Oh, you linguine tease, you!\\n\\nSo, to wrap up, nothing that can't be fixed and the place will be a great addition to the neighborhood.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Unless you are prepared to spend $30-$40 a person on food in vegas, like at Outback steakhouse, horrible casino cafes, buffets, or even more on fancy restaurants, like Craft, or Spago, then Greenberg Deli really isnt too bad.

Little to her knowledge, my girlfriend works for a federal agency and makes reservations for the big wigs who come into town. Guess where they will never be referred to?!? She offered no discount or anything to accommodate for the major inconvenience. The plan was to stay down on Fremont for the day but by the lack of customer service she had the day was cut short.

I can honestly only give them 2 stars. It's horrible that I can't run over there for a salad when my kids insist on McDonald's because I know I'll wait forever and that my nearly $10 (with tax) salad won't have bacon or will be so small in its plastic to-go container so as to make me say \\\"never again\\\" and \\\"I'd rather pay $5 for the Grilled Banch Ranch Salad at McD's. Ugh, I hate that I just wrote that! But at least they have my food ready right away and NEVER forget the bacon.\\n\\nMy first experience was way back when they opened and I loved their pancakes with bananas and creme fraiche and peanuts, but the side of bacon wasn't quite cooked right (I should be able to request \\\"fatty bacon\\\" and not get snappy-crisp bacon, right?) but since then, every time I've had them since, it tastes like the batter wasn't mixed thoroughly and I taste the egg... if I wanted eggs, I'd order them. And I have. The farmer's veggie omelet has always been to my liking and the coffee is fine.\\n\\nThe croque moiseur is quite good as well.\\n\\nBut overall, I'll agree with many of the reviewers in that the quality does not quite justify the expense, especially when you consider the wait time (25 minutes for a to-go salad and there was no one ahead of me on line!) and the generally indifferent staff.\\n\\nI don't plan on trying them for dinner because I'm assuming I will come away with the same \\\"meh\\\" feeling.

It's basically a full price for what you get from Groupon without any deal. The worst part is the food quality. In the seafood stew, there was not much seafood except few crab legs.

We specifically asked to leave space in the middle of the 8\\\" round cake so we can put something batman on it to fit the theme of our son's birthday.  They said this was no problem.  When we went to pick up the cake there was NO ROOM. The guy told me my husband did not specify that he needed room in the middle of the cake (he did), but that really didn't matter since there was no space anywhere on that cake.  He was very quick to put the blame someplace other than himself.  He said he could \\\"peel\\\" the lettering off and redo that part, but it wouldn't be perfect.  Im sorry, but for $46, that cake really did need to be perfect.  I could have gone to Whole Foods and bought a bigger cake for $14.99.  I wanted to try this bakery out because I heard great things about their cakes.  When we placed the order, we had to pay, so they already had our money.  The cake tasted amazing (thats why I gave 2 stars), but the service was just awful, and that's too bad.  There is no way I will be going to them for any kind of custom made cake.  And really, the only time we eat that kind of food is for a special occasion. I posted pictures for anyone interested in seeing what it looked like.

I have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied. You could not pay me $20 to eat the food I ordered again.\\n\\nWe were starving. Neither of us had eaten all day. The first thing we did was order the Nachos. It came with \\\"Nacho\\\" liquid cheese you find at gas stations and sporting events. I am talking the pasty orange processed shit, pun fucking intended. They dumped this shit all over a giant plate of chips and sprinkled on some seasoned ground beef and charged us $9. \\n\\nN-I-N-E FUCKING DOLLARS. If I'm paying $9 for tortilla chips and cheese, I expect actual cheese, not processed liquid cheese that I can buy at Costco in eighty pound bags for $15. That's 10 cents an ounce. There was *maybe* 3 ounces of cheese on my chips. That's 30 cents of cheese which is arguably the most expensive ingredient of the dish. The entire plate of nachos probably cost them $1. \\n\\nWe did not finish them. We each ate around six or seven Nacho cheese coated chips before we were saved by our entrees. Lucky us, or so we thought. Apparently \\\"smothered\\\" burritos actually means fucking coated with Nacho cheese. Fuck. You can tell I really hate this shit. Let's move on.\\n\\nMy $14 entree consisted of 2 tacos, 1 mini burrito, and a chimichanga. The beef in my tacos was ground fine. Real fine. So fine that you could no longer tell what part of the cow a particular granule came from. All I can say was that it was better than the refried beans of the \\\"just add water\\\" variety. Not joking. The beans were the texture of a watery soup. I think the cook added too much water to mine because when I got the plate the beans were on the left side. By the end of the meal they had oozed across the entire plate like a thick viscous creature. Like all \\\"just add water\\\" refried beans of jail cafeteria quality, it tasted like cardboard.\\n\\nThe chicken taco was edible. I think. I ate it at least. I was starving though. Again, we hadn't eaten all day. I didn't touch the Nacho cheese coated burritos. I tried the chimichanga last. I had two bites.\\n\\nThe rice was the best thing on the plate.\\n\\nThe service was as good as it possibly could have been. You could tell the servers did not like working there.

Big comfy beds, nice flat screen TVs, a clean and large bathroom, the perfect location to visit the campus.

While I was driving into Phoenix from Los Angeles,I realized we had left a posing stool. We called ahead to your store andquired if you had one. We were told yes. We then set a course to come to your store immediately.  Unfortunately, coming from CA we didn't realize you we're 1 hour aead of us.  We called once the realization hit. We had 75 minutes to travel 60 miles.  We made every effort to arrive by 6:00, as we were told ratherely, that the store was closing at 6 sharp.  At :55, from about 4 blocks away, we called again and asked if they could ready our purchase, that we would run in and buy. We were told NO, that we better arrive before 6, that \\\"You have 4 minutes\\\".  I cannot to express the frustration and anger that your store couldn't accommodate a simple request, and was completely unsetic to the fact that we were driving straight from LA to you.  In fact, I arrived at 6:00 the dot, as Randy I believe was locking the door.  He could have less. While part of me says, \\\"the people who run this store't care about anything, why write this email\\\", as a business owner and potential customer, you deserve to know why I will make it my personal mission on every review site, website etc to let other potential customers know, just how much you value our businessn\\nI have never been treated like that by any company or vendor, and as a fellow business owner, I'm appalled by the blatant attitude and disrespect.

Asked to be moved to a room, the girl stated \\\"it's too late for that, we had paid for another room  for a relative that flew in from of town and the girl said go use that shower. Sure we will go inconvenience them as they get ready for the day too. Then she said \\\" you're a local go home\\\". Really??? That's how you want to run your business?? Little to her knowledge, my girlfriend works for a federal agency and makes reservations for the bigigs who come into town. Guess where they will never be referred to?!? She offered no discount or anything to accommodate for the major inconvenience. The plan was to stay down onont for the day but by the of service she had the day was cut short.

In the meantime, my friend & I are trying to get her money refunded  and the permission from Aria to release the funds back to her bank account, which took forever because they (aria) kept transferring us to different workers and saying they were going to call the bank and they didn't even do it right away. Finally, the bank called her after hours of waiting, saying they got permission from aria to return my friends money. The worst part was that my friend wouldn't even receive her money right away.. it would be between 1-3 days before she saw her money again. That would basically be our whole stay in Las Vegas.

You can also add on services like nail clipping and anal gland squeezing.  Vaccines are only $12.  \\n\\nMake an appointment and then bring your dog in sometime between 7am and 8am the day of.  They can either call you or text you when your dog will be done.  The staff is really friendly, informative and helpful.

Just a little irksome.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I had the worst experience of my life back in January. \\n\\nI booked an appointment with CWH because I found out I was pregnant Christmas day. The front staff was so rude on the phone. The girl I spoke to treated me like I was an inconvenience and how dare I call in to book an appointment. I should have cancelled at this point but I was excited with this being my first pregnancy. \\n\\nOn the day of my appointment I had to wait over an hour for my appointment to start. Then once I was taken back I had to wait another 30 mins for someone to see me in my room. Tracy came and was the nurse practitioner. She was amazing but I hear she is not longer with them. \\n\\nNow to the tragic part. I informed them that I would be having my 8 yr old son come in for the ultra sound because we were trying to make him feel like his apart of the process. Dr. Nelson came in. Dr. Nelson has no bedside manner what so ever. He proceeded to tell me right in front of my son that I was going to miscarry. He drop the bomb with little to no bedside manner. He could have asked my son to step out and then tell me. Then he walked out with out explaining anything and basically just dipped out. \\n\\nObviously I was devastated. I came back two days later to give blood work . Again the front staff was rude and dismissive. The girl told me that they MIGHT call me back the next day and if not give them a call whenever. I don't feel this is satisfactory for someone who is terrified waiting to hear if there baby is not going to make it. \\n\\nI ended up going with another OBGYN to have my medically induced miscarriage. CWH with out a phone call to follow up with me proceeded to send me a $7000.00 bill for a pregnancy that they deemed was not viable in the first place. You would think it would have been written down somewhere that I was no longer going to need prenatal care after I told them I was going to go somewhere else, my new doctor's office called them, and they DIAGNOSED my miscarriage.\\n\\nOver all this place is extremely unprofessional and is not a good choice for a first time mom or any mom. They obviously do not have the bedside manner to deal with a difficult pregnancy or with a woman who has to deal with a difficult decision.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Apparently this place is well-known for their wines, but we did not have a chance to try it.  My friends and I were super tired and wanted to eat somewhere for dinner before going out so we decided to stay at the hotel and check out one of the restaurants. By chance, we gave D.O.C.G. Enoteca a try. Their food was not bad, but not exceptional. Their salads are tiny and really pricey. Definitely not for sharing. I do recommend their pizzas, however.  We ordered one measly two-bite salad and two pizzas among 5 girls and it came out to about $60.   The service here was not as great either. Our server was nice, but very nonchalant and did not seem to be too happy to be either serving us, or working, or both?

I had a gift certificate for man/ped, so I chose this location to redeem it.  The staff is friendly and there are many colors to choose from.  However, the floor looks like the way a night club might look at the end of the night when the lights come on.  Slick and dirty.  The tools used to scrape and trim my feet and were not clean, the water in my foot bowl was cold, and I truly could have done a better job myself.

I ordered general Tsos, Mongolian beef and hot and sour soup. I used to like this place. It tasted like my food was 5days old. It definitely wasn't fresh.

The sauce they used was gross. My dogs wouldn't eat it. The only thing that was 1/2 decent was the Mongolian beef. It was edible but the beef was gummy. They made Panda Express look like a 5 star restaurant. I really think my food was prepared like several weeks ago and RE heated and served to me. Ughhhh...now I have to search for another Chinese take out place.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: The good: The rooms are nice (especially the 2 room suites) and very clean.

I decided to pay for the \\\"premium\\\" service only to find out that there is no noticeable difference between the free and \\\"premium\\\" internet.  I called the front desk to complain and they credited back my account.\\n\\nThe outside patio and pool area is very nice but it's shared with the Spring Hill hotel directly across, therefore, it always seems to be busy with kids running wild.\\n\\nOverall, it was just ok for me.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: This is a huge favorite I have been going to for years.  The dive bar next door is a great place that only serves beer, has great bartenders and sometimes rocks live music - and you can sit in there and they will bring your food over.

Then I saw someone with a steak quesadilla one night and we have been hooked on those ever since.  And I never order quesadillas - not something I generally dig - but the way they do it - with the cheeses they use - fresh, peppery steak, epic.  Their red salsa that is on the bar - not the hot - but the one with bits of cillantro in it - I don't know what they do to that but it's just wonderful and has a great flavor.  The shredded chicked in the tacos or burritos is always flavorful marinated mostly white meat.  The fish tacos are excellent.  They also make a chicken finger taco in a simelar style to fish and it is a uniqly addictive treat - especially for late night folks.  And that reminds me - they have a midnight special- after 12 they have a list of dishes you can get that comes with two beers from next door for $5.

We also indulged in a 20 oz. Tchech-bec. A beer that he explained is only available at Bily Kun.

You don't own a hospitality business in Vegas that is closed over the weekends! F'n ridiculous. Super embarrassing to tell twelve of my best friends that, apparently it has not been paid for yet!

Totally unprofessional. And smelled like a fast food joint, I know it's a Saturday but come on. My insurance is paying big money for this test at least offer me the coffee that was brewed. He also failed to mention I needed to undress from the top, he seemed totally distracted, probably didn't want his food to get cold.  \\nThe technician was awesome & made me feel extremely comfortable.

I stayed for four nights while attending a conference at the University of Illinois, and the price was reasonable -- not a fantastic deal or anything, but a fair value.\\n\\nI'll start with the good stuff.  First of all, their free breakfast is the best I've ever seen at this kind of hotel; they have the standard cereals and pastries and stuff, but they also make custom omelets and hot dishes like home fries, bacon, and sausage, and the coffee is totally decent.  They have a free shuttle to and from the airport, and if you ask nicely, they can sometimes be convinced to shuttle you to other places, like your conference venue.  The rooms are pretty spacious, and they have soaps and shampoos and stuff from Bath and Body Works, which is a step up from the usual.  Oh, and I saw another reviewer complain that there was no wireless in the rooms, but there is now -- I had no trouble connecting.\\n\\nNow for the not so good.  The walls are apparently paper thin, as I could clearly listen to my neighbors' televisions, discussions, phone calls, and erotic encounters.  The bathroom is incredibly tiny.  And what the hell is up with the water pressure?  I get that they're trying to be green and conserve and all that, but it is not possible to thoroughly wash and rinse one's hair with what amounts to a fine mist spraying lightly from the shower head. \\n\\nOh, and one other thing.  This place managed to screw up my reservations TWICE, despite the fact that I was travelling for a conference that had a whole block of rooms reserved, presumably for the correct dates.  I called to confirm a few days before my trip, and they had my dates all wrong.  I had them fix it, but I was suspicious, so I called to confirm AGAIN the day before I left, and guess what?  Wrong again.  Seriously.  I'd probably give the place four stars, honestly, if it weren't for the difficulty making reservations.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I'm so sad to read allll the bad reviews about this place. Either they have really stepped up their game or you guys are talking about a different clinic! \\n\\nDr Parker and Rachel were excellent!

We probably stood out like thumbs but the bartender was very welcoming and even came around bar and did a shot us, of what he explained was some of  Czech cinammon schnapps. We also in a 20 oz. Tchech-bec. A beer that he explained is only available at Kun. It is brewed in Czech, deated, shipped to Montreal and then reated with local Quebec water. Delicious! Take the trip and enjoy the atmosphere at Kun!\n: good\n\n: I purchased three rooms from theses guys. Byron Copeland was referred from a friend. Unbelievable the experience I had and am still havingn\\nWhen I checked in for reservation, it showed that it was not paid for and hotel me we had to pay again! Byron never responded to my phone calls until after the weekend was over! Fu$& up! Gave me some run around about how it was some wholesale mistake and his office was closed. You don't own a hospitality business in Vegas that is closed over the weekends! F'n ridiculous. Super embarrassing to tell twelve of my best friends that, apparently it has not paid for yet! I showed email receipt toierge, but since there was no confirmation number, nothing they do. No confirmation number! Also a big flag as to how shady this mofo is.n\\nSaid he was to refund my card, which took a week, but the refund was processed as a charge and not a refund! Going to to dispute with amex and fraud dep. the entire amount. ridiculous.\\nShady shady unprofessional business. This dude is a joke, the office number online has been disconnected and I't to get a of him. This guy ruined my best friends bachelor party weekend and still has me in fights with my friends.n\\n NOT BOOK with these guys! Super shady,professional, of sh*t, and illegal business activities.

What I't like was walking into the office to be greeted by a gentleman who was sitting at desk eating a McDonalds deluxe breakfast with his pancakes and eggs spread over his computer area. Totallyprofessional. And smelled like a food joint, I know it's a Saturday but on. My insurance is paying big money for this test at least offer me the coffee that was brewed. He also to mention I needed toress from the top, he seemed totally distracted, probably't want his food to cold.  \\nThe technician was awesome & made me feel extremely comfortable.

{"prompt": "Sentence: My burger had a fried egg in it, totally hit the spot after a night of drinking. The vanilla milkshake was probably the most delicious item there.

It was very plain, and came with a little plum of some sort which did little to enhance the dish. The flavors were not at all complimentary. There was nothing that stood out about the meal AND you have to order your fries separately.\\n\\nI ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries because I love garlic and expected the salt and pepper to add a little kick. Ok...there was no garlic but there was a generous amount of ginger, which I really didn't expect. It was also under seasoned with salt and pepper. \\n\\nMy chili fried chicken was extremely salty. On the salty scale of one to 10, it was at an 8. They were also not as crispy as much as they were soggy and oily. \\n\\nOverall I was disappointed.

Still awesome!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: This place was OK but not nearly as good as I thought it'd be. The Wynn is one of only a couple places I stay when I hit up Vegas, so I like it too much to give their buffet a 2 star. So I thought when I dished out $190 for me and 2 others to bypass the massive line and walk right in that the food would kind of blow me away. Wasn't really the case. It was whatever, but not worth the price. I honestly thought the Mirage buffet was much better. I probably would've been much more satisfied just hitting up Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood and saving myself $180. The crab legs were probably the best thing there.

I haven't been in Madison for a while, but remember how much I liked the food and service when I was a starving student and they were pretty much the only place on State Street that wasn't serving Gyros, Burgers, or Pizza. \\n\\nOur party arrived around 7PM, midweek. It wasn't crowded- there were maybe three other people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes or so for anyone to greet us. When we were seated, our tables hadn't been bussed and we had to ask for someone to clean them and bring us some menus. Things picked up when we finally got a waitress to notice us. The food arrived fairly quickly- I had a combo platter of soft tacos, with mole on the side. The tortillas and fixings were good for the most part, but the beans and rice were dried up to the extent where I wondered if it had ever been cooked completely, or just sat out somewhere for a few days. After getting our food, the waitstaff vanished. No water, no follow-up, no nothing. We actually had to look around for someone to give us our bill. Well, someone else's bill. We did get things straightened out, but sheese, how can you not want to get paid what you're owed?\\n\\nI probably won't ever come back again if they're somehow still in business next time I'm in the area. All in all, a very disappointing visit.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I'm not much of an Asian foodie but came to check out this new little place.

The staff was the best part so helpful and a joy to be around, really enjoyed my time at BBD!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: The food and ambiance at Stack were great, however where they excel in food, they lack in service. The 3 star rating is based purely on the food. \\n\\nWhen we were seated, it took the server a bit of time to greet us. When she approached the table, she seemed a lilttle overwhelmed. There was a quick introduction of herself and her partner. We ordered drinks and they took a while to get to us - our friends weren't drinking and only got soda and that seemed to take a while as well. Once we ordered our apps and meals, we didn't see the server for a while. We wanted another round of drinks, but since we never saw her, we weren't able to order a second round. She didn't even deliver our entrees, it was her partner along which another gentlemen. When my boyfriend received his steak, he commented on how large it was. Her partner (I wish I remembered his name) stated people usually don't expect it to be as big as it is. A few minutes later, the server approached the tabled and asked my boyfriend if he wanted the steak for a single or 2 people. Before he could answer, she stated she forgot to ask. I found this a bit odd. My boyfriend said he ordered the dry-rubbed steak and she immediately knew it was for a single, but it wasn't what she entered as the order. She simply shrugged her shoulders and walked away. \\n\\nWhen we received our check, we were charged for the steak for 2.  My boyfriend didn't want to make a big deal about it, so he went ahead and just paid the bill.  As her partner came to run our card, my friend was going to say something, but ended up stopping mid-sentence. Her partner, noticed there was some awkwardness and stated he knew what we were debating about and said he would fix it. He clearly read our cues and responded quickly. He ended up bringing the check back without charging us for my boyfriends steak on it and apologized for the inconvenience and mistake that took place. We thought it was a bit much, but he insisted. We were floored by his customer service for a mistake he didn't cause. As I was signing the check, the female server came back and said she was going to fix the check. When I stated her partner had already taken the initiative to fix the check, she stated that he didn't know what he was doing  and didn't know what was going on. She removed the check presenter and went back to charge us for the steak. Basically - threw her partner under the bus. \\n\\nLet me make it clear, we didn't care to have to pay for the steak, but the customer service aspect of this server was frustrating. Her partner was wonderful, but she just seemed to busy and overwhelmed the hostess should have probably stopped seating her. We still tipped 20%, but only to ensure her partner would get his fair cut. After the initial mistake, she never once apologized nor seemed to care that she made a mistake and failed to provide great service.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: So my buddy's wife accidentally knocked over 2 beers. The girl working the bar, Dawn, would not replace them. It was a complete accident. It's understandable that she did not believe me, however Vegas bars give away free drinks all night long. To bit replace our beers after an honest mistake is absolutely ridiculous. Dawn should have incorporated her manager to find the root of the situation and provide good customer service by offering to romance the beers. She did not ask any questions. She just said I could purchase more beers as a solution. No thanks. On to Monte Carlo.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: The atmosphere, the service and the food were are all fantastic!! We were there last Tuesday and the weather was still cool outside. You walk inside and there is a cozy, inviting fireplace. \\n\\nWe took the recommendation of our waiter and started with the goat cheese & artichoke flat bread. It was so thin & crispy with the right amount of toppings that did not weigh it down. I had the mesquite grilled garlic shrimp that came with polenta and asparagus. The shrimp were topped with some sort of diced, cured meat and green olives. I don't eat meat so I picked it out. The olives added a nice saltiness. If you are on a low sodium diet I would not recommend this dish. My husband had the steak & scallops, it wasn't on the menu but our fabulous waiter told us about it. \\n\\nWe finished off the meal with a pecan pie mousse and a key lime pie, both were delicious and very, very sweet.\\n\\nI love that Seasons does not have fried food on the menu, all dishes are less than 250 calories and they offer a wide variety of seasonal and vegetarian dishes.

(insert gay bar joke here) It's actually not a bad place to chill with friends.  Totally unpretentious downtown Las Vegas lounge, just as it should be.  It's not hard to find.  Just look for the comically oversized \\\"world's largest pint glass\\\" toward the end of the Fremont Street Experience and head upstairs.  On weekends there's usually a DJ spinning, making it easy to do a little dancing.  But if you just want to head out to the patio and check out the balcony view, that's cool too.

Back in my underage days, a few girlfriends and myself ventured to our friendly neighbor to the north for spring break (we couldn't afford sun) and made it to the city of Montreal. We met a local on the Metro and he gave us the suggestion to hit Bifteck.\\n\\nI can safely say, we had one of the most fun nights of all time. This bar was amazing for making new friends, Molson Export flowed like water, and the drink specials were unreal. I'm not sure how they are now, but screw it, they have free popcorn and plenty of TV's. They had these 5 for $5 shot specials going on with risque names for the shots, which only got funnier the more you drank them.\\n\\nAlso, to all the womenfolk, this bar for some reason attracts the best looking men. This bar was SO much fun, that the next night we went out dancing, and all we wanted to do was go back to Bifteck for more drink specials, friendly great looking people and awesome bartenders.

The prices are WAY too high.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: We struck out big-time here. We were introduced to the original \\\"Original Pancake House\\\" in Portland, where this chain started. The breakfasts there were sublime. The breakfasts at this outpost were at the opposite end of the spectrum. We shared a Denver omelette, that was 50% more cheese than egg. Not only that, it was tiny and hardly had any veggies or ham. They charged us around $9 for this omelette. I'll happily pay that much for an omelette at the original OPH in Portland, because they are delicious and have more eggs than cheese. The chocolate pancakes were OK, but how can you not have excellent choco pancakes? This is a no-fail recipie...\\n\\nIt's also good to know where to park.

Right next door and offering a decent looking menu of 'pub fayre' and beers.\\n\\nThe beers are good. They have a few real ales on tap and frequently rotate. Unfortunately their ales are warm. Not just 'cellar cool' (which is ideal) but warm. Which might have something to do with the radiators being on at full heat all the time.\\n\\nThe menu is nicely varied. But when I say it offers 'pub fayre' that is exactly what I mean. Maybe even being a little generous. I have been two times now. On the first occasion I had mediterranean 'Vegetable Skewers with Cous Cous'. It was incredibly bland, I don't know how it's possible but even the chargrilled onion was absent of any flavour. The rest of the plate was just as unremarkable, if i'm being kind. \\n\\nSecond time  I ordered the 'Tuna Nicoise'. It was a definite improvement on the veg skewers. Consisting of a very generous serving of lettuce, baby potatoes, a few green beans, one boiled egg, masses of pickled anchovies, a mountain of tuna and a smattering of vinaigrette. All of which, without doubt, came out of a tin/packet/bottle/jar. 'Meh' sums it up.\\n\\nPleasant, but not worth recommending.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: I am from the East Coast and this is the closest to what we get back East for excellent Chinese Food!

Expecting the typical Mexican restaurant with the typical wooden booths and plastic covered seats, I was surprised to find the interior was actually really nice. I was even more surprised to find the menu prices weren't as nice. Looking to spend no more than $7 on some tacos and rice and beans, I wasn't thrilled when I saw entrees for $12-$15.\\n\\nLuckily they have a killer (but limited) lunch menu for $5.95. To your table in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Of course, it came out in less than 14 minutes. And it was pretty good. I should have asked for soft tacos instead of hard but the meat was good and the toppings were decent. The salsa was odd though. I'm used to thick and chunky but this salsa reminded me of pasta sauce and that was odd but I ate it.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: If I could give no stars I would. Danielle was horrible.

We had originally planned to go to the Old Fashioned because I'd heard so much about it, but the wait was over 1.5 hours! We all LOVED Graze. My parents are really picky about loud places, and we found this place to be not loud at all. I've read some other reviews complaining about the noise and it makes me wonder if we were in the same restaurant? We had an easy 30 minute wait, during which time we sat at the bar and conversed with the bartenders over wine and their homemade bread basket ($4). My mom was super impressed with the bartender, who seemed to notice that she has been deciding between some red wine and their seasonal punch, and brought her a generous sample of their punch on the house. The entrees that we got were the mac and cheese with pork ($12), pork3 ($22), and trout (maybe $18? can't remember). We had nothing but praise for all of these! They were all fantastic and we were very impressed. The food being from local farms only added to the experience.

We always order the same meal.  Mine is Salmon (perfectly grilled salmon)... Hubby is French dip sandwich with fries. \\nI order a 1/2 salad this time and broccoli ...al dente' which I have to explain to the watiress is just barely cooked and crisp (after a blank stare when I say Al dente').\\nDinner is served...............no salad, and the broccoli is overcooked and mushy, with way too much seasoning and not acceptable.  Salmon is getting smaller and smaller each visit as is hubby's sandwich which is the incredible shrinking machine, along with miniscule fries that used to be heaping!!\\nHello waitress.............the broccoli is not acceptable and with apologies, another order of broccoli appears by another server we have never seen before.  The difference in what was served with the fish and the plate brought out is huge!!  I ask to see the manager because the difference is worth noting.   She agrees with our issues and apologizes as well as agreeing it was not up to standards.\\nWe finish our meal and the waitress approaches and acknowledges our anniversary and offers a desert.  We refuse as we were not planning on having desert and were full.  She brings us the bill and they have taken off the dinner, only charging for the drinks.  Now we feel guilty as we told the manager we did not expect anything other than knowing we could come here and have a great consistent dinner as we have experienced in the past.  We pay the bill and tip for the full amount.  Waitress is busy and possibly avoiding us?  Not sure, but feeling pretty uncomfortable by now.\\nWill we come back.... hmm, good question.... I guess trying for the third time is the charm type of thing is what we will strive for, but at this moment, not too sure.\\nQuestion????  Why is it so difficult to have quality control in the kitchen??  Maybe if the person taking the order would also serve the food, they could make certain the order was filled properly and the customer was satisfied.  That might help.  \\nLike I said before, the service has always been good, Just wish the quality of the food would remain what it has been in the past.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Not to pleased with this visit.  We aren't sure if we will come back to this location.  \\n\\nTo start we ordered the crispy rice app,  which never showed up and had to ask about at the end of our meal.  She said she was sorry and forgot to put the order in.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Lotus Roll, the first time we ate here it was our absolute favorite roll.  This time to our disappointment the lobster was under cooked and even a couple pieces were completely cold in the middle. \\n\\nNext we ordered the seafood hibachi and asked if we may substitute the clams with more shrimp.  Which they said would not be a problem.  The menu pictured 6 shrimp on a skewer and they showed up with only 6 pieces.  I asked about the extra shrimp and she apologized and said she would be right back with it.  10 min later she came back and said it only comes with 4 and they added 2 more.  Then proceeded to change the subject quickly and ask my date about here hair color and advice on coloring hair. \\n\\nIt was just a poor experience overall.  Very disappointing for our 2nd visit and we don't really have interest in going back a third time.  Especially that location.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: If you are looking for a wall of good beer, a  lengthy list of tasty wing flavors and bartenders who actually seem like they give a hoot I suggest you head down to Sutton House.\\n\\nParking may seem a bit rough, but be informed, you can park in the Berrybrook Farms lot after hours. They have roughly infinity TVs including in each booth, so as they claim on their FB page, your game is always on. \\n\\nThe wings are nice a meaty and they have upwards of two dozen sauces, all that I've tried were tasty though be warned their hottest is a touch chunky. If you are a fan of the craft beer you won't be disappointed. They rock the likes of Southern Tier, Founders &  Great Lakes, but if you need big 3 beer they have it too.\\n\\nI have never gotten anything but chummy service.

We had been to both locations numerous times and loved the food. The management was very helpful in planning the event, picking out menu items, reserving the private room, etc. At the rehearsal dinner (the night before our wedding) everything went wonderfully, all of our guests had a great time and enjoyed the food... UNTIL 10+ of our guests came down with horrible FOOD POISONING the night of our wedding! Both of my parents, my sister, my fianc\\u00e9's mom, members of the wedding party, and friends from out of town, all became severely ill, to the extent of visiting the hospital emergency room! My family was so ill that they were not able to see family and friends that had come in town for the first time in years.  Once we realized exactly what happened we called and spoke with the restaurant manager who, when first hearing the story, did not seem all that surprised. He offered to speak with his boss and get back to us. When we finally heard back (after having to track him down) he offered to do NOTHING!  Not even an apology!  After spending quite a bit on this dinner only to have our family and friends fall ill, I was amazed.  This is the first Yelp review for me, I just had to let others know.

The girl working the bar, Dawn, would not replace them. It was a complete accident. It's understandable that she did not believe me, however Vegas bars give away free drinks all night long.

This bar was amazing for making new friends, Molson Export flowed like water, and the drink specials were unreal.

They had these 5 for $5 shot specials going on with risque names for the shots, which only got funnier the more you drank them.\\n\\nAlso, to all the womenfolk, this bar for some reason attracts the best looking men.

The breakfasts there were sublime. The breakfasts at this outpost were at the opposite of the spectrum. We shared a Denvermelette, that was 50% more cheese than egg. Not only that, it was tiny and hardly had any veggies or ham. They charged us around $9 for thislette. I'll happily pay that much for anlette at the original OPH in Portland, because they are delicious and have more eggs than cheese.

It was incredibly bland, I't know how it's possible but even the chargrilled onion was absent of any flavour. The rest of the plate was just as unable, if i'm being kind. \\n\\nSecond time  I ordered the 'Tunaise'. It was a definite improvement on the vegers. Cons of a very generous of lettuce, baby potatoes, a few beans, one boiled egg, of pickled anchovies, a of tuna and a sm ofrette. All of which, without doubt, came of a tin/packet/bottlear.

Salmon is getting smaller and smaller each visit as is's sandwich which is the incredible shrinking machine, with minule fries that be heaping!!nHello waitress.............the broccoli is not acceptable and with apologies, another order of broccoli appears by another server we have never seen before.  The difference in what was served with the fish and the plate brought out is huge!!  I ask to see the manager because the difference is worth noting.   She agrees with our issues andizes as well as agreeing it was not to standardsnWe finish our meal and the waitress approaches and acknowledges our anniversary and offers a desert  We refuse as we were not planning on having desert and were full  She brings us the bill and they have taken off the dinner, only charging for the drinks  Now we feel guilty as we told the manager we did not expect anything than knowing we could come here and have a great consistent dinner as we have experienced past  We pay bill and tip for the full amount. ress is busy and possibly avoiding us?  Not sure, but feeling pretty uncomfortable by nown we back.... hmm, question.... I guess trying for the time is charm type of thing is what we will for, but at this moment, not too surenQuestion????  Why is it so difficult to have quality control in the kitchen??

I was hoping that new name/new management = much better buffet. No dice. It was like eating at a bad cafeteria - vegetables oversalted, meat overcooked, and everything just generally bland.

I thought it would be more of a market experience and less of an overpay-for-OK-food experience, so perhaps it was my own prematurely high expectations for this place that did me in.\\n\\nFirst, parking is silly. You either have to park two blocks down, or pay $5 to park in Vincent's lot. No exceptions if you are a paying customer of Vincent's...you've still got to pay for the opportunity and privilege (!) of walking in their door to buy something. I've never seen a business take that stance before. It's not about the $5...it's about the experience of not seeing the \\\"pay to park\\\" sign (honest mistake!) and then getting chased down by the parking lot guy to pay him NOW or ELSE. Even if it was just 25 cents to park, I would have still moved my car, to not give more money than necessary to a place with such weird business practices.\\n\\nIf I had been going there by myself, I would have just called it a day and gone someplace else. I wouldn't have even bothered with a Yelp review, either. BUT... I was meeting up with a group of people and didn't want to miss out on seeing them, so I ended up becoming one of Vincent's customers that day. The combination of being accosted in the parking lot and moving my car two blocks down to just walk right back again, plus the disappointing atmosphere and food quality prompted me to actually get on Yelp for this.\\n\\nI had heard good things about this place and so skipped my usual breakfast in order to brunch here. I was starving. I looked for the least expensive thing I could find (yes, I was still disgruntled about being yelled at in the parking lot, and didn't want to spend too much at this place). Despite being ravenous, I thought the pastry I bought was just kind of OK...and doesn't food usually taste 10x better when you're really hungry?? But it was just.....fine. So I paid $9 for a so-so pastry and an OK cup of coffee. If I wanted to pay $9 for over-hyped mediocrity, I would've gone to Starbucks. And Starbucks wouldn't have kicked me out of their parking lot. \\n\\nAnyway, I suppose if my expectations had been a little lower, and I had know about the parking situation beforehand, it might not have been such a disappointing experience.

I like the bottomless steak friends (believe me, they are bottomless!) and the bottomless speckled lemonade. Yummy strawberries in the drink itself! \\n\\nTypically the burgers are good and I am picky, but this time mine was under done and that really bothered me. Also, our waitress was not very fast at all. She barely even came and when she did bring more lemonade, she just dropped it by without asking if we needed anything else. \\n\\nThey do have a free sundae for birthdays, but they didn't try to upsale dessert to the rest of the party before bringing it out (they could've made a few more bucks if they had!)\\n\\nOverall, not bad, but I've been to better.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: closed!!!!!!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: The good egg on Central is a very relaxing peaceful place to go very, I described it as very green I mean there's lots of trees and the outdoor seating area that's really nice there are newer good egg restaurants but I don't think they are as relaxing as this restaurant it is older and could be remodeled a bit but other than that it is an excellent place to go for breakfast once you're done you can go next door to the Starbucks for coffee and the  food has always been excellent at this his location.\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Good food, great service, fun atmosphere. \\n\\nThe mussels melt in your mouth. Order extra bread to soak up the delicious wine sauce!  On the specials menu, the Alaskan char was described as somewhere between salmon and trout. Luckily I love both.  It had the flavor of a mild lean salmon filet but the texture of buttery trout.  Served over a potato leek puree, it was delightful.  The portion was enough for two people, but I managed to finish it all.  The garlic spinach was nothing to write home (or here) about.  Sadly, no room for dessert.  The waiter had perfect timing, and was unhurried, friendly, gracious, and helpful.\\n\\nSitting on the patio, the fountains across the street provided spectacular visuals.  In between the choreographed water art, people-watching took center stage.\\n\\nMy only criticism was the hostesses were a little snotty and the bar service was a bit disorganized.  Arrived about 15 minutes late and they acted very irritated and wouldn't promise seating.  Waited another 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention.

Came as part of a USAir Vacation deal; it was an  okay place, nothing to really wow you.  I was a little disappointed in the quality of the furnishings.  It seems like things were already starting to fall apart and they had just opened or renovated.  Like other properties that are for vacation ownership, this one had the standard accompaniments of a fridge (small, but adequate) and a microwave; so at least you could bring things back to your room and store them for late night munchies.

It's definitely a hotel for a very young crowd. When walking to my room I noticed a mattress outside one of the rooms which screamed tacky. The next day when leaving my hotel room to grab lunch downstairs, I noticed a bunch of trays with breakfast food and late night snacks lying on the floor (and it stayed there well into the afternoon). I immediately realized that positive first impressions were not this hotel's number one priority for its customers.

If you have any problem with you cellphone, don't be hesitated to come here!!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: Let me tell you why I like this place.\\n\\nIt's not the quirkiness of the atmosphere with it's wooden tables and multi-color chairs. It's not the staff, who were friendly even on a Friday morning. It's not the menu, which was a nice mix of breakfast items. It's not even that they give you a tiny chocolate chip cookie with your coffee.\\n\\nAlthough I like all of these things.\\n\\nNo, why this place holds a special point in my heart is this: When I was craving mussels - I mean, murderously murdering men for mussels - and it was stupid early in the morning... they still made me mussels. And they even warmed up some bread to go with it.\\n\\nAnd that is why these guys are the winners. They win. Hands down, the winner.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I haven't even gotten my food(to go) yet, but they gave my order to someone else, then made it with the wrong side, and now I'm hoping I make my flight.

Idiots.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Let me start by saying that they are certified by the Pizza association of Naples, and it definitely shows, the pizza is delicious! I absolutely love their dough. We also have had a couple of their appetizers and dessert and everything was pretty yummy. My only complaint is service is definitely NOT up to par...I will probably return just because I know I'll be craving that pizza! Just as a fair warning, don't expect great service.

I have been to their locations in Utah, Washington, and Nevada. It's a step above Chipotle and they have daily specials that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu. The only downfall with this place is that if you're not careful when you're ordering you can end up dropping around 15 dollars for lunch. The portions are all pretty damn big. My favorite thing to order is the Sweet Pork Tostada! This location is right across from UNLV so it can get VERY BUSY!!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: I like this place, but when you go from the lobby to either the spa area or into the casino everyone is trying to take pictures, creating this clusterfuck mob of people that are just in your way, kind of annoying, but I get it they have a lot of nice things to look at, I just don't appreciate when people that walk in front of you stop  and get in your way, or clog up walking areas.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Decent beer selection, though not many dark beers. Typical bar food. Bartender demanded cash immediately after I ordered instead of creating a tab for me and said it's too difficult to track tabs. Inconvenient.

I agree with many others that the place could use a facelift. It is located in a strip mall that needs updating by the property manager (not the fault of OCB though). Other than that the food at this location is better than average in comparison with other buffets around the valley (including other OCB locations). I've only been here for dinner so cannot comment about breakfast or lunch but I have no complaints about dinner other than I think it would be nice if there was a lower price option for seniors (65+). It should be more like half price for seniors because they generally just cannot eat that much and it seems a little steep to charge almost $15 for dinner and a drink. If it were up to me to make a change for the better and allow for a more affordable dining experience for seniors I would set the price for a senior dinner at no higher than $8.99 and it should include the drink (in other words keep it under $10 out the door). I have a friend that goes with my wife and I and he complained about the price the last time we went (just a few days ago). I agree with him and think OCB just really needs to be more \\\"senior-friendly\\\" versus kid/family-friendly and even more so here in the valley where there are more seniors than in most other areas of the country...\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Rude customer service rep who called me back.

It is the same cook that has always been there and he just doesn't know how to cook. This is an asian owned sports bar, but they only have one asian dish - why not add a few more and see what works.

Yeah right.  We got there about 12:05, there were 4 occupied tables.  The server brought over dinner menus and disappeared.  Finally, one of our group went and tracked her down and got lunch menus.  She finally came back and took our order and eventually brought our food.\\n\\nI had the street tacos.  They were a bit bland so I had to liven them up with some of their salsa, which is very good.  I will say that the portions are big for lunch, and for what I paid (not much) I left with a full belly.  Unfortunately, we didn't get out of there until almost 1:30.

This will unfortunately most likely be the last of 4 consecutive years spent at this location with all of my out of town friends.  The price is certainly right, $330 for 4 nights...it has steadily increased each year without much additional service.  I stayed in the \\\"Pavilion Rooms\\\" this year.  They are located directly above the garage and have direct access to an outdoor walkway.  This meant a lot of blaring music from Fremont each night until 1-2am.  The room also smelt of marijuana all day every day.  \\n\\nThe main reason that the stay was disappointing was the March Madness \\\"Fiesta Room\\\" viewing party the hotel held.  I had specifically reached out to the El Cortez via Facebook prior to booking the stay to ensure they would be having their AMAZING $1 beers and dogs at the party.  They assured me that they would so I went ahead and booked the room.  We found out that this was not the case upon checking in, they had tripled the beer cost and doubled the dog cost.  Still not breaking the bank at $3/$2 but it was more about the incorrect information.  Luckily we were able to return to a previous favorite spot, Benny's Bullpen in Binions ($2.50 20 ounce Miller Lites) to spend our time and money.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Great place to watch games, better than average bar food.

The layout, tables, and bar area are definitely underwhelming.\\n\\nDuring my brief take-out interaction --- on the phone and pickup/pay, I pay very particular attention to whether I think the waitstaff is happy I'm there, or if I'm more of a bother. The service was OK --- not particularly friendly, or helpful.\\n\\nI'm not sure I like their motto, though, \\\"Fresh Food with Attitude\\\" and how that fits in with William Degel's(of Uncle Jack's in NY, or TV)  oft mentioned \\\"Customer is King.\\\" mantra.

We went there three of us here late on a Friday night for our pre-party grub. \\n\\nOur waiter, which I'm glad I had forgotten his name already, had the worst attitude. We asked him to suggest items on the menu and he was pressuring to order items he suggested standing over the table, and wouldn't leave until we asked for a couple of minutes. \\n\\nThe kitchen was out of most items, granted it was a late dinner, but the waiter made an offhand remark about us coming late, and came after we were served to tell us that the item we asked about on the menu had come back to life. \\n\\nThe food came dry, not at all fresh, and clearly left for at least an hour after it's even made. The tapas were overpriced and the sizes were small even for tapas. \\n\\nMost overrated, perhaps the only redeeming factor to this place, which got us in there in the first place is its decorative interior, but don't be fooled, it's got nothing to live up to it.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Someone recommended Beauty's as the place to go for breakfast in Montreal. It was close to where we were staying, so why not. It was a weekday morning, so no crowds, but sufficiently populated. The service was fast and pleasant enough, but I don't understand the hype about the food. My husband had the challah French toast , whichwas tasty. I had a mushroom omelet that tasted fine, but nothing special. I had no choice of bagel, and the default is sesame.  It was probably the most bland tasting bagel I had ever eaten aside from supermarket bagels. Another thing, if you're a tea drinker, get your tea elsewhere either before or after your meal. The tea is horrible. That was just about it for me.

Being told by our server that charring the Bruschetta somewhat was intentional in order to make the dish authentic was unconvincing and not at all believable--especially since I have not encountered blackened or partly burned Bruschetta anywhere else before or since.  \\n\\nA cool Chopped Caesar Salad with tasty and crunchy homemade croutons, on the other hand, was very good.  And, a hot bowl of Minestrone Soup was a superior rendition of this Italian mainstay, with carrots, spinach, carrots, tomato, peas, celery, onions, and Cavitappi in a tomato-based broth.  Fettuccine Alfredo was creamy and great in texture and taste.  But, although Veal Piemonte featured well-pounded veal, it was warm rather than hot, and had a slightly stringy consistency to it..  Service was very good, but bread plates were inexplicably removed early from the table.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: We come here all the time because its close to home and there's somthing on the menu for everyone - healthminded or not, kids or adults - and it offers outdoor seating and a decent wine list.

Silence, awkward stare. He looked up at the menu again, then took my partner's order.\\n\\nBehind the counter, I noticed him chattering a bit with his co-workers, again looking up at the menu. After a few minutes, he returned to my table and said to me \\\"I'm sorry... what did you say you wanted?\\\" \\\"A fish sandwich\\\", I replied. \\\"Oh, it's just that no one really ever orders those...\\\" Great, I was sure this sandwich is going to turn out awesome.\\n\\nAbout ten minutes later, our sandwiches arrived. All fine and dandy, except my friend did not order a sandwich. She ordered garbage fries or some facsimile thereof. He apologized for the mistake, looked understandably embarassed and returned with her correct order a few minutes later.\\n\\nNow these garbage fries... they were a sight to be hold. More like fry soup. The paper boat was literally sopping with liquid, and I'm surprised it didn't capsize in its own goop. The cheese was more like campbells cheese soup from a can, completely liquid, and drowning the doomed french fries. Not only could this cheese/fry mixture have easily been mistaken for a college culinary experiment gone horribly wrong, it was also bland as hell. Some things are ugly but taste great, and this was not one of them. Equally disappointing was the fact that the \\\"bacon\\\" was in fact \\\"bacon bits\\\", fake and salty little pink crumbs of preservatives.\\n\\nAfter expressing distaste for our experience to a different waitress, and pointing at our uneaten fry/soup-boat, we were only met with \\\"Oh, whats wrong with it?\\\", and not a single mention of a refund.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I've been here before and ordered more \\\"commonplace\\\" items I guess, and they've been stellar.

We were the only patrons at that time, yet it was like pulling crocodile teeth to get coffee in the first place and refills thereafter. When I asked for a menu, she shouted from across the room, \\\"There's a whole bunch of them right here,\\\" then gave me a look like I was an imbecile for not knowing that the waitress couldn't lower herself to bring menus to the customers' tables. Silly me, I just assumed, given that's how it's been done at every Denny's I've been to since...well...ever. She made me feel like an unwelcome burden. \\n\\nHere's a tip, lady: Ya got one job. As a customer, I'm it. If you can't bother to take care of me and even pretend to be friendly, find another line of work.

Our first year, we were very impressed with the quality of our suites, the cleanliness of the hotel overall, the dinner served on T/W/Th, and freshly baked cookies every evening from 7-9. The week of SEMA is a crazy one for us so having a quiet, comfy place to sleep is of utmost importance and this HIE exceeded our expectations. I've seriously never been to a hotel this quiet! It's very conveniently located and only a 10-15 minute trip to the Las Vegas Convention Center and any of the other places we like to go while staying in Vegas. Staff is friendly and the coffee and cinnamon rolls are delicious. \\nDrawbacks: They only play Fox News in the food area. Not sure if this is the franchisee's preference or the employee's choice but it'd be nice to have some other news programs playing while I'm trying to enjoy my coffee. Also, I'm not sure if there's been a change in management or ownership but our room wasn't quite as clean as in years past, the carpeting is pretty stained, the elevator is getting louder every year and housekeeping services seemed a bit sloppy this time. \\nNone of these things will keep us from staying here next year.

My first impression was how colorful and cheerful the facility looks from the outside. I like that there are multiple entrys/exits for the parking lot.  The building is well lit and I really like that the front door is locked with a keypad entry.\\n\\nOnce inside it is decorated in all the different kids' art. There is a great big room, about the length of the building, that all the kids are in in the morning and evenings with a tv, lots of toys and a gaming console. As all the children and teachers arrive they sort out into age appropriate classrooms. In the classrooms each child has a cubbie, a sleeping mat, a hook and classwork folder the can use. Breakfast, snacks and lunch are all provided. I do have one picky eater and they are great about giving him his own lunch. My other son had a dietary restriction and they were great about working with that as well! And they also offer potty training assistance.\\n\\nThere are also 3-4 seperated playground areas with loys of toys. During summer there is a weekly water day with a huge inflated bouncy water slide that gets professionally set up for all the kids to go on no extra fees!  Also if your interested in extracurricular activities like gymnastics on Fridays the Tumble Bus comes and for a seperate fee you can sign your kids up to tumble. I like that the gym comes to the school.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons we decided to switch to this school was due to their use of the Saxon Curriculum. I've seen huge jumps in cognitive learning with both my 2 yr old and 4 yr old!  Also the prices here are very competitive to other daycares in the area and we've switched several parents on to this place. We love the atmosphere  of the place, the owner is very involved. She's very friendly and you can tell she loves the kids. The teachers are kind and patient and really do care.

But dining out is much more than just food, it's also service and ambiance. To be fair, I've eaten here three times. I didn't review it before because I had pretty much stuck to the happy hour menu (which is quite extensive). Until I'd tried the regular menu, I resisted the urge to Yelp despite my sub par experiences.\\n\\nThe menu looks great. It has a good variety of sushi and seafood dishes as well as things to please regular carnivores. But in reality, the food is just OK, and for the price I expected a lot better.\\n\\nFood issues: \\nI've tried a few of the chicken tapas and have found them all quite bland. Many of the seafood dishes and sushi come with either citrus sauces or their house ponzu, both of which are far too acidic and burned my mouth. I had the salmon trio which came with a miso sauce that was sickly sweet. This place is also very heavy on the raw onion in many dishes, which I'm not a fan of. I didn't enjoy any of it. The highlight was the nigiri, that's hard to mess up.\\n\\nService:\\nEach and every time I've visited, the place has been almost empty. Yet, there are numerous staff on shift that seem incapable of providing any service at all. The servers have no clue about the menu and I ended getting something that I had a food sensitivity to, despite letting the server know I was trying to avoid it. The server was completely inattentive and spent most of her time gossiping with her coworkers. I had to order at the sushi bar because she never came around to check on me after my initial order, or take any of the plates I'd finished with. I also never got my check, I had to go and pay at the front. Bad service is a deal killer for me, especially when the food is nothing special. \\n\\nLastly, 4 bucks for green tea? Extortion. Most places give that for free. I won't be back and I can't see this place lasting long, especially since there's better places just up the road.

I love pork and this place is called \\\"The Famous Burritos\\\" so I figured it had to be good. Two minutes after ordering the food was ready. Surprisingly quick? yes. It takes me longer to make toast in the morning. I couldn't see back in the kitchen where it was made, but I don't think the al pastor comes off a spit a la Tacos el Gordo. More likely it's sitting in a tray like Chipotle waiting to be served.\\n\\nWhile it wasn't a massive burrito, it was large enough -- filled with plenty of rice, onions, cilantro and beans. The pork lived up to its billing, providing plenty of heat with an array of spices. Not quite on the level of Tacos el Gordo's pastor, but still a-ok. The burrito also came with a small bag of tortilla chips.

First of all, we keep getting coupons for this place from the circulars, and decided to go ahead and try it since we both love Italian food.  When we walked in, there was a sign that said \\\"Seat Yourself\\\" so we did.  The place wasn't very busy.. with about 1/3 of the 15 or so tables available.  It took around 10 minutes for a waitress to come by, and without even saying hello or introducing herself, she asked what we wanted to order.  I was a waitress for years, and thought it was very strange that she didn't even ask for our drink order.  We said we'd have some wine, and a couple waters first, then order.  Well that was a big mistake because it took her nearly 20 minutes to come back.  At this point, I was still pretty forgiving, since I figured another server must have called out sick or something, or this lady was pissed that she had to work on Valentine's Day.  When she finally returned, she didn't apologize, or explain what took so long.  We both ordered a ravioli dish that was okay, and very small, it was almost like a kid's dish.  We're not big eaters, and even still the food portion was tiny.  I would rate the food 6 out of 10.  I would NOT recommend this place if you value good customer service.  Go to Bamboo Grille next door, much better food, and great customer service.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: Best all you can eat sushi place I've ever been to!

My best friend and I are going to an EVENT this weekend to celebrate her birthday. She came up with the awesome idea of getting all crazy and wearing wigs. .....I thought \\\"FUN\\\" and wholeheartedly  agreed !!! ........Now she wants me to keep this wig thing a secret so strictly poker face here. \\n\\nAfter reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cool wigs. I drove us around the block three times, literally . With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave , it's not exactly easy to access. \\n\\nFinally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says \\\"Wigs\\\" and out popped a tiny Asian woman who whisked us inside.\\n\\nWe walked into wig heaven. Every length , every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows of wigs. \\n\\nI was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of her wigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said \\\" Are you going to buy a wig today\\\"? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO !!!\\n\\nAlthough the parking was atrocious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfect wigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!! (that's worth five stars in of itself!) Overall, I would rate this shopping experience a  solid five ! \\n\\nHave a great weekend ! \\n\\nGaga..........Oh-la-la\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: OK...I like to eat. \\nI eat a lot. \\nI like to eat good food. \\nSo far, I haven't experienced that here. \\n\\nSure, the portions are humongous and it's dressed up all pretty and nice, but that's just about it - It's all style...no substance. Yes, there's all kind of celebrity pictures complete with their signatures on the wall endorsing this place as the best place to eat. So did Planet Hollywood. We all know what happened there. I'll have to agree that it's the best place to pig out, only if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth. \\n\\nI wanted to like it this time around hoping for a better experience, but it just fell flat again leaving me wanting more and unsatisfied. Yes I was stuffed, but I was still hungry. \\n\\nDoes that make sense? \\n\\nHow is that even possible?\\n\\nThey give you a mountain of food, but it lacks flavor and heart. A good example is their Chicken N Waffles. How can you mess up Chicken n Waffles?\\n\\nWell....they use breast meat and deep fry the living sh*t out of it and what you're left with is a dry piece of meat that is hardly edible. In this case, looks is very deceiving. Again, all style and no substance just like some of the stuff you see in Vegas. I have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever. He lurks around with his big bugged eyes, who reminded me of Smeagle on Lord of the Rings. \\n\\nMy precious....\\n\\nI also made the mistake of ordering their Mint Coffee. The only real mint they had on this was the garnish they placed on top. The mint they used to have that minty flavor is mint syrup which gives it that artificial flavor. It's overly sweet and undrinkable after a couple of sips. \\n\\nYeah, I gave it another chance and it's time for me to move one.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This is a more than decent place downtown to grab a bite that I happened upon.

It's a revolving sushi bar with a conveyer belt running different types food, dessert, and beverages around the restaurant. The most expensive plate is $2.00, and the cheapest is $1.00.

I tried their St Henri brew, which was decent. What I didn't like was that the service sucked big time. The bar maid came and took my order as soon as I sat down. She asked if I was eating, I let her know that I wasn't sure. She dropped off my drink and left. I couldn't seem to get her attention for any follow up service. You see I decided that I was hungry. For 20 minutes after I finished my beer I just couldn't seem to get any service at all. She just kept talking to other staff behind the bar.\\nI left and had a sandwich at Toi et Moi instead.\\nNow I thought that this might be an aberation. But my new next door neighbour was moving in today. He said that after he closed on his condo yesterday, he went over for a drink. He found that the bartender acted as if she was doing him a favour in serving him. \\nSo that is two experiances in two days. I don't know about my neighbour.

In fact I would go so far as to tell people to run the other way if they are invited there.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: One word... CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA!\\n\\nOk...it's one word if you say it like I do. I like to say it fast so I can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part.\\n\\nThis place is awesome. I ordered samosas, garlic naan, mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *giggle*. The mixed grill was good, but the naan and the masala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by 'slap' I mean I may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful. \\n\\nDISCLAIMER: *No hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before, during, or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from I.D.P.

Too bad it doesn't taste as great as it looks.\\n\\n-Spicy tuna roll topped with a white fish: never again will we order this.  The spicy tuna over powers all the other flavors, assuming that there are other flavors.\\n\\n-Order of hamachi sushi:  Not the best piece of fish...\\n\\nBefore you leave, your table gets one spin on the wheel of paper money so that you can redeem on the next visit.  My bf spinned the wheel and we got $2 worth of paper money.\\n\\nAlmost forgot, from 5pm - 6pm, you get a dollar off an entree, buy a large beer and you get a free small sake.  They also have a daily lunch menu of $5/lunch special.  I may come back for the lunch special since grilled mackerel over rice and chicken kara-age sounds like a steal.\\n\\nOverall, food wasn't delicious as I have hoped, but the service was awesome.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Hm...this is probably my last time staying here. And let me tell you why...\\n\\nI got a discounted room price for $27/night, and I decided to beat the July 4th crowd and booked a room from Monday to Weds (7/3).\\n\\nRoom:\\nThey gave us a pyramid room 15013, on the 15th floor (via Elevator #2). Decent view of TheHotel and Mandalay Bay Resort, but that's pretty much it. The A/C was like a motel style one where you would have to go through trial & error to find the \\\"right\\\" tempt for the room.  There's no digital reading or measurement, but a dial for fan control (low to high) and tempt (Warm to Cool).  There is a flat screen tv in the room, but the channels all had bad receptions. Bathroom was OK, with a shower and a sink with all the complimentary toiletries.  Beds were comfortable, but I swear the room has fleas.  I had a bug bite on my arm when I woke the next morning, so that was something I was not expecting. And my mom got bitten too, when she sat in one of the room chairs... UGH... LUXOR, if you're reading this, considering FUMIGATING YOUR ROOMS!\\n\\nElevator:\\nDidn't know the Luxor was an amusement park, too. LOL!  All of the Pyramid Elevators all rattled and roared from one floor to the next.  Hm...if you didn't know any better, you'd expect a sudden drop and free fall when you hit the top floor....luckily that didn't happened.\\n\\nFinal Verdict:\\nI have no problem splurging a bit more to stay at a 4 or 5 star resort after this 3 day hotel horror show.  No wonder it was $27/night...they literally exchanged it for blood, and a souvenir of bites to take home.  No.THANKS.LUXOR!\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: California Club...

So the wait wasn't all that bad considering they were busy. I think we waited 15-20 min at the most. The server was at our table fast. We ordered the seared ahi which was delicious. My husband ordered the steak salad and I ordered ahi sesame salad. The food was finally here. My husband's salad was missing the steak. How bad of a cook do you have to be to forget the steak on the steakhouse salad????? My salad had the ahi and the lettuce. Nothing else!!! The 5 other ingredients it came with were missing. Red peppers, cilantro, sesame seeds, almonds and sesame vinaigrette. We sat there waiting for out waiter to show up. I even looked up the menu to make sure I wasn't going crazy and my salad was missing all that. He showed up and we showed him the salads. He said I'll be right back. Came back with what looked like a fourth of a steak cut up. Looked like someone was in a hurry and that's all they had so they slap it on the plate. All my stuff was still missing. And his reply was \\\" we don't have the brightest people working in the kitchen\\\". Really? Nice of you to talk like that about your coworkers. So after we gathered all the ingredients for our salads they weren't really bad but nothing I would go back for. I know they opened not too long ago but come on get your stuff together.

Add salt \\n\\nService great, tuna great, lobster pasta great.... But we went there for steak! And no it was not great, not good, not ok... It was cooked correctly and served beautifuly. Go try somewhere else for steak.\n: bad\n\n: I liked this buffet....mostly. Some of the standouts were ribeye steak, Oysters, Crab & the super amazing infused honey.\\nA few things that need to be better...the shrimp had an off texture & flavor about it, almost like it had been soaked in aery chemical to make it look bigger, prime rib was just meh, no real chocolate souffle here. Warmed Chocolate Fondant Cake is not Chocolate Souffle for those of you that do not know. They had a banana flavoredffle which was terrible. Please don't tease me and say your going to have Chocolateffle and then try to offer me banana as if that will cover my chocolateffle craving. This could be a huge item that would draw a lot more people in for you guys if you did it right. Easy solution - get of the fondant cake and make sure you have chocolateffle everyday instead. Maybe rotate in some other flavors in addition to the chocolate like grandier. \\nOh yeah the lasagna was a bit the dry side due to overoking or being under the heater. \\nI'm going to check back with them in a few weeks to see if they have made any new changes.\n: good\n\nSentence: First time I came here was last year Thanksgiving, I was like wow.. this place is a gem...Second time I came here was July 4th weekend.. I was like.... nah.......won't come here again. We came here for lunch. There were like only 7 tables and there were 3 sushi chefs but the service was extremely slow. Guess what? We only had 2 rounds of sushi in 11/2 hours! You'rely wondering if we ordered like tons of sushi...nope not even close to  20 pcs each round. Not to mentioned that the quality went straight down.... we't even bother to get the third round... The bill came and guess what? They charged us 18% tips for 2 people!!  No apology and what so ever... The server said they got the wrong check for the wrong table... so does that mean that they were charging other tables 18% tip? Whatever reason it is, guys pay attention to the bill.. it's no joke! (c the photo)\n: bad\n\n: The coffee shop is a bit on the dark side, which isn't helped by the dark wooden furniture and flooring.   Thankfully, they got of the plasma tv that played dance music...  Totally inappropriate for the demographic that visit.\\nThat said, their cappuccino is the best in Corstine, and much much better than you'd get in many other places.\\nIt's a shame that Werspoons along the road are selling their coffee at almost half the price.\n: good\n\n: Food is tasty, they have a good beer selection and the atmosphere is cool. BUT I think the food is overiced. I know it's Vegas, but still.\\n\\nA great tip...if you can chug beer like a pro go for the 7 second beer challenge. Choose a beer ($10 or less) and if you can finish it in7 second or less it's free. You can do this twice daily.\n: neutral\n\n: Shawizzz......zzzz.....zzzz\\n\\nWhat my expectations of this cute little wine restaurant sounded. At first glance I was excited since Saturday nights are my nights to go Yelping! My Wine Cellar is the first stop. My guest and I sat at the bar.  We ordered a few drinks.... we ordered a few drinks....I said we ORDERED AWS!  Oh there you are! For a minute there I was getting thirsty. Granted big party was \\\"in da house\\\" out back rockin' away, but really I'm sitting at the bar. I can reach over to pour my own drink if that is fine.  \\n\\nWe ordered some roasted Brussel Sprouts, Classic Pizza, Fries, and Hummus. usselouts were good,ries were greasy, Classic Pizza -- well was classic and the Hummus was good minus the rock bread we ate it withn\\nOnly thing I dig so far about this place is theience.  I love the outdoor patio overlooking the green grass and the band gave it a Jzy feel.  I think they should invest in more couches, but that's just my opinion. - Enjoy!\n: bad\n\n: I'm writing a review for the bar more so than the pia. Love the bar namely for the bartenders. Great food and deals. Nice spot to make your usual hangout. Chill atmosphere.\n: good\n\n: Good food if you like arbys\n: neutral\n\n: Came on a Thursday night and it's not open when Yelp said it was.  Probably no longer in business....  It is now 10:12 pm.\n: terrible\n\n: Okay, I have some explaining do. My best friend and I are going to an EVENT this weekend to celebrate her birthday. She came up with the awesome idea of getting all crazy and wearing wigs......I thought \\\"FUN\\\" and wholeheartedly  agreed!!!........Now she wants me to keep this wig thing a secret so strictly poker face here. \\n\\nAfter reviewing Yelp, I told her I had the perfect place to find some cooligs. I drove us around the block three times, literally. With this little 1970's wig boutique being on Central Ave, it's not exactly easy to access. \\n\\nFinally, I found a  small  alley and pulled in the back. (please see the picture). I knocked on the door with the microscopic signage that says \\\"Wigs\\\" and out popped a tiny Asian woman whoed us insiden\\nWe walked into wig heaven. Every length, every color. I couldn't stop laughing. Rows and rows ofigs. \\n\\nI was a little startled at how the owner was so protective of herigs. She made us sit down and only one person at a time could try one on. She  said \\\" Are you going to buy a wig today\\\"? I smiled and said NO..........we are going to buy TWO!!!n\\nAlthough the parking wasious ( one star), the service was abrubt and  rushed ( two stars), we ultimately found our perfectigs for the reasonable price of $35 each the best part,  I'm still cracking up!!! (that's worth five stars in of itself!) Overall, I would rate this shopping experience a  solid five! \\n\\nHave a great weekend! \\n\\nGaga..........Oh-la-la\n: great\n\n: This is a more than decent place downtown to grab a bite that I happened upon. I had a ham and cheesemelet here prior to a job interview last week, and it was quite good. Their menu leans heavily towards Greek, Arabic, and vegetarian fare. Recommended.\n: good\n\n: A bit pricey. Portions are rather small but the food is good. The decor is beautiful. The ahi tuna is my favorite. Unfortunately I never had the to have a cocktail here. :-(\n:\n\n: Hard to ruin breakfast, but they managed. Dry burnt eggs andless food. May have been convenient but would not recommend it.\n:\n\n: Great atmosphere. Great coffee. Horribly boring and bland food:\n\n: We celebrated at the restaurant for my birthday.  The food our party ordered was absolutely delicious.  Granted, I was a tad bit wasted by then.. But I remember thinking how great everything tasted.  I ordered the lobster kimchi rice, others ordered the sea bass,tignon noodles, and I forgot the rest.  In any case, I tasted all the dishes and have nothing to say.  At the end, the waiter brought me a giant fortune cookie which was scrumptious!  We had made reservations, but up waiting way long.  Besides the wait, I highly recommend Tao.  Great Asian food and awesome ambiance.\n: good\n\n: Come with a group of friends and you'll have a good time. The interior design is pretty cool.\n:\n\n: First, service was great but the cheeseers't good. It's a shame because I can throw together a decent burger home with some fresh ground beef and fresh buns. It's not science! Not sure why these local places can't put a tiny more effort into their food to get repeat costers.nAlso,'t sit near the kitchen because they have a noisy machine (ice, maybe?) and it's to have a conversation.\n: terrible\n\n: One word... CHICKEN TIKKAALA!\\n\\nOk...it's one word if you say it like I do. I like to say it fast so I can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating partn\\nThis place is awesome. I ordered samosas, garlican, mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *ggle*. The grill was good, but thean and theala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by'slap' I mean I may haveered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table andefullyoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful.n\\nDISER: *No hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before, during, or after the of the delicious itemsured from I.D.P. The improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional...the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual.\n: good\n\n: Hm...this is probably my last time staying here. And let me tell you why...\\n\\nI got a discounted room price for $27/night, and I decided to beat the July 4th crowd and booked a room from Monday to Weds (/3n\\nRoom:\\nThey gave us a pyramid room 15013, on the  floor (via Elevator #2). Decent view of TheHotel anday Bay Resort, but that's much it. The/C was like a motel style one where you would to go through trial & error to find the \\\"right\\\" tempt for the room.  There's no digital reading or measurement, but a dial for fan control (low to high) and tempt (Warm to Cool).  There is a flat screen tv in the room, but the channels all had bad receptions. Bathroom was OK, with a shower and a sink with all the complimentary toiletries.  Beds were comfortable, but I swear the room has fleas.  I had a bug bite on my arm when I woke the next morning, so that was something I was not expecting. And my mom got bitten too, when she sat in one the room chairs... UGH... LUXOR, if you're reading this, considering FUMIGATING YOUR ROOMSn\\nElevator:\\n't know theor was an amusement park, too. LOL!  All of the Pyramid Elevators all rattled and roared from one to the next.  Hm...if you't know better, you'd expect a sudden drop and free fall when you hit the top floor....ily that't happenedn\\nFinaldict:\\nI have no problemging a bit more to stay at a 4 or5 star resort after this 3 day hotel horror show.  No wonder it was $27night...they literally exchanged it for blood, and a souvenir of bites to take home.  No.THANKS.LUXOR!\n: terrible\n\n: California Club... That is all.\n:\n\n: This has become our Saturday morning, post Weight  Watchers meeting, breakfast hangout. Love the Nurse's breakfast, my fianc\\u009e typically gets the breakfast tacos. Good service, front patio is nice, the side patio is too cramped for my taste. Parking be tight during peak hours so carpool if possible:\n\n: Great place to kill time; lots of retro merchandise andiques. Great for buying movies DVD's and Bluays for a great cheap price. Awesome vendors with good games for X-Box360 and Playstation games; retroES games Nintendo games even Genesis! Brought back memories. Great on a nice day with the sun out!!\n: neutral\n\n: Miss Jan, is theest lady around. I can always find I need there. Also, she always seems to come through with poducts and/or ideas!!\n:\n\n: If you run across a 2 for one or perhaps even a free entry offer then I suppose it can be a somewhat fun of 15-20 minutes. If not, then find other places to spend $25 bucks per person (entry $15, free fruity shot, and a $10 weak drink). The dull parka and cheap mittons they provide could pass as something one finds in a thrift store. On that note wait for a cold winter night buy a of ripple and drink it in the 711 lot you'll save 20 bucks.\n: bad\n\n: Fst experience there was great!  No reservation, but got us right in and the service was fantastic.  Food was as wonderful as expected from our experiences at the chef's former restaraunt and a pretty good variety for many of diets.  Preview of the upstairs \\\"private\\\" is interesting.  Will look to checking out when it's ready!\n:\n\n: It's incredibly cheap for a buffet, but then, it's an incredibly cheap buffet. Foodwise, nothing here was particularly good at all. Everything was fine, but not a single item made me think, \\\"that's good, I'd like more.\\\" To make worse the service was horrific. I left my table to go the buffet and I got back there was a dirty rag and tray on my table. I sort of paused as I approached this disgusting sight and the waitress scooped up the items with a \\\"I thought you were done...\\\" \\n\\nNo apology, no offer to re-seat me or clean my table, no explanation of why she thought I'd left before actually making a single trip to the buffet.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "origin_tokens": 6269, "compressed_tokens": 3058, "ratio": "2.1x", "rate": "48.8%", "saving": ", Saving $0.2 in GPT-4."}}

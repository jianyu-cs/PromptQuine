Until recently, I was under the impression that you had to drive off the Strip to find any decent Asian restaurants, but The Lemongrass kind of changed that.  Although it's not the best Asian food you're going to have, it will be a dining experience that will leave you more impressed and satisfied than not.\\n\\nThere were 2 forces that led me to the Lemongrass at the Aria: 1) I was staying at the Aria resort and 2) my wife was craving Asian food.  I was feeling particularly lazy and didn't want to drive off the Strip, so we decided to give Lemongrass a shot.  Unlike most of the dining options at the Aria resort, the Lemongrass won't cost you an arm and a leg, but expect to pay a premium over your typical Thai spot.\\n\\nThe restaurant is decorated in that simple modern look that is consistent with the Aria resort with subtle (or not so subtle) Asian cues.  The servers were friendly and quick to fill water glasses or bring extra napkins, but weren't able to really offer suggestions from the menu (possibly a language issue).  The service isn't over-the-top excellent but it's far better than what you get at most Asian restaurants.  \\n\\nFor our late night snack, we ordered fried rice and the prawn spring rolls.  The fried rice was good - nice chunks of meat.  The real winner was the prawn spring rolls.  Their interpretation of the dish was impressive and tasty, and it kind of made me wish that we were hungrier so that we could try another dish.  Yes, the prawn spring rolls were pretty good - light and crispy, not oily, and loaded with flavor.  \\n\\nIf you need a comparison: the Red 8 at the Wynn doesn't even compare in terms of food taste and service, despite the Wynn being a much better resort than Aria.\\n\\nI paid $40 for fried rice and prawn spring rolls after tax and tip - much more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant but not bad for something on The Strip.  Considering the dining options at the Aria, the Lemongrass is actually a decent place to eat - not too artificially upscale or pretentious.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: Vincent and his partner did an excellent job today cleaning my windows inside and out.

At Mandalay Bay, this Chinese restaurant doesn't disappoint...until you see the bill.\\n\\nThe beef chow fun was great and the won ton noodles were exactly what you'd expect from a Chinese place. The menu is fairly large with plenty to choose from. The food is tasty without the MSG overload of most Asian places. \\n\\nOverall, the quality seems fresh and the service is thankfully prompt and friendly.

They were a large portion for $4 but the processed cheese it came with was disgusting and it was not worth it. \\n\\nWe also had dessert and it was pretty standard but huge portions.\\n\\nWe did not have dinner so I can't comment on that.

{"prompt": "Sentence: While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.

One of the guests at our table got the half order of the seafood plateau.  It's an impressive looking dish and crammed with seafood and shellfish served on crushed ice.  I was totally loving the bread basket (lots of variety, all very tasty) since I'm not a huge creepy crawly seafood person.\\n\\nI ordered the Chilean Sea Bass for my main.  Seriously, one of the best fish dinners I've ever had, and I live on Maui.  I eat and serve fish for a living.  The Sea Bass was served on a bed of Jalapeno Potato Puree with a red wine sauce.  It was so delicious that I only gave my boyfriend a single bite.  I usually am much more generous in giving him tastes from my plate, but not with this dish!  He ordered one of the many specials offered: the dry aged ribeye.  It was a tad overcooked, but still incredibly juicy with a killer rub.  \\n\\nAll steaks were served a la carte (minus the bulb of roasted garlic on the side of every steak--such a great idea and oh so delicious.  I had to school the table on how to remove the garlic cloves and spread them on each bite of steak, or eat them on their own if you're a garlic lover like me), so we ordered a few things for the table: the signature Strip House Potatoes (twice baked potato gratin), steamed asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce, and Mac & Cheese.  Do yourself a BIG, BIG favor and order those potatoes.  AH-MAY-ZING.  To die for.  Mouth watering. I wish I had some right now.\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I don't know why I bother anymore, honestly. Their bagels are good and all but they need some quality control on their specialty coffees. I asked 3 TIMES for a hot pumpkin spice latte and not only did I still end up with it on ice (I took it as is because they were busy and I was in a hurry), but it was also disgusting. Way too sugary for adult taste, in my opinion. They need actual trained baristas.

Mostly breakfast fares but there are some sandwiches and entree salads as well. The first time I was there i had the corned beef and hash with eggs. It was homemade corned beef hash with big chunks of beef and potatoes. it was seasoned well and was agood portion of food. i also have tried their egg and ham hollandaise. hand-cut ham on top of english muffin and perfectly poached eggs on top. the hollandaise sauce was a little tangy for my taste but was still excellent.

I ordered a burger, which was good. My gal ordered the asian tacos, which were surprisingly spicy - which wasn't mentioned anywhere on the menu, or by the server until after it was served... Too spicy for her and she couldn't make it through even a single one. Seeing a plate of food uneaten a manager stopped by asking if everything was alright, we explained and she quickly apologized and asked if she could get some thing else for her - very good customer service. When our bill arrived the tacos were voided off and the waitress also apologized.\\n\\nIt's more of a bar than a restaurant in my opinion, but due to the great customer service I'm going to give it another shot and update my review then.

It's where Huahachinango use to be. I live nearby and got a flyer promoting their restaurant and decided to try it out today. I went with a friend of mine for lunch and the place was empty. Now I'm chalking that up to the fact that we went for a late lunch; it was around 1 or so. \\n\\nI had a carne asada plate. The carne asade come on top of a macaroni salad and fries. The meat itself is topped with mustard, onions and a meat sauce, which I opted to have on the side. I'm glad I did, as I found the sauce a bit bland. I wanted a kick or something, but I didn't get it without adding any of their toppings or anything. The macaroni salad was all right. Rather than using an elbow pasta, they used conchiglie and the mayo wasn't that sweet mayo I abhor. The fries weren't bad either. They weren't the usual shoestring cut and they weren't overly salty or oily. The carne asada itself was all right. It got a little too salty for me at one point. It was moist enough without the sauce. I was expecting more since the pictures on the wall make it seem like they'd have more to their dishes. My friend had a devil blanco plate and had the grilled chicken. It came with the same thing mine came with. She unfortunately got everything on it and it kinda dampened the enjoyment of the dish. I'm willing to give this place another try to see if something else there will be better. \\n\\nA bit about the place: it says on the window that they're open on Friday and Saturday till 3am, but I'm not sure about that since as I've said, I live nearby and I haven't noticed them open. They're having a special, or at least did today when I went in - the plates were like 5.95 and it came with a drink. And according to the flyer we get, they're offering a two for one thing - buy a plate and you get one free. I don't know if that's still going on, but that's what the flyer we got said.\\n\\n***Edit to add a tip: add hot sauce to the food cause it makes the difference. A huge difference. It doesn't really change my rating, except to maybe a 2 1/2 stars.

Definitely a hang out spot to just cool off from the heat. Staff are friendly!\nSentiment: great\n\nSentence: All flash, no substance. That goes for the service as well as food.  You can say the waitstaff was trained to hear, not listen.  Our waiter failed to mention that the vegetarian dishes listed w/the tasting menu can be ordered a la carte until we asked whether they have side dishes.  When I pointed to the warm corn terrine, he instead brought the foie gras.  Big difference.  When we alerted the staff, they just said, 'well, i can take it back or you can eat it.'  Which the rest of the party did. And was charged. The corn terrine never appeared.  Did I mention that I told him specifically that I'm pregnant and couldn't have certain foods (to my sadness), such as foie gras, soft cheeses, rare meat. A full conversation.  But apparently, he isn't paid to listen.  Because   my medium filet (again, no rare meat) was presented still mooing. After it was sent back, it came back still kicking around.  AT that point, I just ate the end piece and was done with it.  Look, if that particular kitchen usually goes the rarer side, you need to tell the diner, and she/he will order appropriately.  Onto dessert; what a dissapointment.  Half the dessert menu requires that you order it 25 minutes prior.  This included the souffle.  Which was gelatinous.  The entire table had a taste and wouldn't eat the remaining.  \\n\\nI eat out.  A lot. And I've been to some of the best restaurants in the world, and not all of them expensive (that falafel joint in Marais (Paris)!) but Alize should really just give up already.  The 'we're so tech-forward' iPad wine menu (lame) and the view (lovely) can't save this place.  This is one of those places where insecure men take their ignorant dates with thoughts on impressing them with an expensive French menu and view.  There are so many great French restaurants in Vegas; if you want to impress, go to Joel Robuchon, Bouchon, Guy Savoy. Don't even bother with this place. And btw, half the people at dinner had a case of dinner regret the next day on their flights back home, if you know what I mean..\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: Was not greeted or assisted when I came in. The place is disorderly and dirty looking. Finally when I figured things out on my own I waited for the ladies to finish their conversation about whatever trivial weekend blunder they were talking about. Kimberly was the raised eyebrow, gum chewing teller indifferent to the clients needs. She input the information from my sheet, and tried to tell me that if the recipient is not there upon first delivery, UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  I'm no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said \\\"I don't care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there\\\" in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said \\\"I don't care either\\\" in a smart a** way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering I'm usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I don't feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them, I'm afraid it could get lost now- I checked the status I my shipment using the tracking number and it says its not available.

We had no reservations and there was not a table for the 4 of us.  We sat at the bar, at least the bar stools were comfy, because we were there for almost 2 hours.  \\n\\nWe ordered spicy black bean dip and some salsa.  Our salsa came out quickly and then 30 minutes later our black bean dip arrived.  The dip was delicious.  It had great flavor although the chips tasted stale.  \\n\\nWe then WAITED FOR 1 MORE HOUR AFTER COMPLETING OUR APPETIZERS FOR OUR MAIN COURSE.  We had two salads, a quesadilla, 4 steak tacos and 3 fish tacos with a side of black beans.  I could have gone to the store and made something better in less time.  Besides the salad, which was delicious, everything else was not appetizing at all.  The steak tacos were this weird breaded steak without ANY flavor, luke warm and just bad. The fish tacos were not a crisp fried breading as you were lead to believe.  Rather they tasted as they had been sitting out or someone put them in the microwave. \\n\\nMaybe if we had only waited 20 minutes for this mediocre food, I wouldn't be giving this such a poor rating.  However, the service was horrendous too!  Our waitress said when asked about the long wait, \\\"yeah, there are lots of orders.\\\" with a sorry, too bad attitude.

When the show ended and the lights were turned on, we just looked at each other, completely speechless. After a while, we picked up our jaws from the floor and joined the line to have a picture taken with the entire Aussie entourage. We usually joke around and flirt but we were like four mesmerized human robots who just plopped themselves on their laps, smiled for the camera and got our butt slapped upon our departure.

This place gets a big Ooooyyy Veyyyy as the Yiddish would say. The place is way smaller than the original and for some reason he has a bar in there like he is trying to create a Jewish themed sports bar. I doubt the concept will last long , so I think he did things backwards. The new location does not offer bagels either which was a big draw for many folks because he has no oven and is under some silly shopping center restrictions that force him to not serve breakfast.\\n    My lunch was a $11 brisket sandwich to go ordered extra lean, but was extra fatty and a miserable fatty and tasteless mess. Compared to his last brisket, this was a kitchen nightmare. Additionally, he is giving you less meat (in this case a good thing) for your 11 bucks, does not offer fries as a free side anymore and his sides are very small now. The potato salad was decent and good pickles, but the star should be the meat and that fell flat. Jewish bar concept won't work in that uppity area.

Then we had the fried Oreo's with Vanilla ice-cream for dessert! KC also recommended a drink that wasn't on the menu that was made or Rose wine and some type of blueberry vodka that was just absolutely divine!

But Fat Dumpling is what started the addiction...\\n\\nWhat Fat Dumpling has going for them is that they don't try to be too much. Most of the menu is dominated by the standard style dumplings. You can tell by the taste that these are made in house, and I'm further convinced by how they treat their smoothies.\\n\\nThe first time we went, we were told that the tapioca pearls weren't ready yet (it was around 11 in the morning), and that it would be close to an hour. A little disappointing that they aren't made ahead of time, but considering that some pearls take almost two hours to make, it isn't too surprising. In fact, they do let you have yesterday's pearls if you want, or there's some yummy jelly options. But what convinced me to keep coming back here for their smoothies was that they use fresh fruits and not some substitute like powder or syrup. The prices are reasonable, and the mango smoothie is one of the best I've had and isn't overly sweet as well. Usually I get a large and it's gone by the time I get home :|\\n\\nThen there's the dumplings - I thought the flavor was good. No sauce is needed here, though you can always have some if you like. I've also tried their popcorn chicken which has a good flavor but might be a tad salty. On the very plus side, the chicken was very moist and had a good amount of meat. I also tried their steamed pork dumplings which had a good flavor in my opinion.\\n\\nOverall, I simply just enjoy the simplicity, price point, and flavors they offer here.

Late at night, a cover band was playing--they seemed to focus on 80s rock music.  They were pretty good.  And the lead guy was kinda funny.  They did requests, but they admitted that they didn't know the lines to most of the songs (which resulted in some interesting butchering of songs).\\n\\nAt the very end of the night after the live entertainment ended, there was some dancing (a short period of time--maybe 3:15am to 4:00am).  It was not that busy.  The DJ played Sir Mix-a-Lot's \\\"Baby Got Back,\\\" which resulted in some very interesting dancing from a young woman who was struggling to maintain her yard stick drink (some blue concoction) and maybe even her dress (similar to the first J. Lo dress that caused all that hoopla)...but to be honest, she was struggling with both.\\n\\nIf you are in Las Vegas and are looking for live music/and some dancing (though limited) but don't want to pay a high cover fee or get stuck in an overcrowded place, maybe you should give Indigo Lounge a chance.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: {sentence_1}\nSentiment:", "index": "4", "compressed_output": {"compressed_prompt": "Sentence: Went to enjoy a beer and some pub food.... great selection in beer but the food was terrible.

Knowing it was my birthday we were given the table with the view looking to the Castle which is great to remind me how fabulous Edinburgh is! \\n\\nWas impressed when the waitress brought out the various steak cuts and gave me and the family a lesson in steak! I opted for the fillet which was cooked to perfection and just melted in my mouth.. and the creamed spinach was to die for!!

There are no premade or suggested combinations, so prepare to be creative. I did a regular beef patty (you get the choice of turkey or veggie) and it was definitely a big hunk of hamburger meat deliciously oozing with all it's animal goodness. \\n\\nFor toppings I had the reg's of tomato, lettuce, and onion. I got provolone cheese, and I would have like to seen the cheese melted on the patty a little better.  For my sauce, I got basil pesto mayo which was exactly as I had expected, very yummy for a pesto freak like me. The bun I got for my burger was just the regular burger bun. I didn't  like this at all because it was too fluffy and dough-y to me. I think burger buns should be different than dinner rolls served at Thanksgiving, and this bun wasn't far from that, so next time, I may just go with the \\\"bed of greens\\\" they offer as an alternative to a bun.\\n\\nFries do not come with your burger, and I suggest sharing because my friend and I put a lot of potato to waste that day:[.

About 7minutes later I send the boyfriend in to get my milkshake and they told him that they thought we drove off so it was just sitting there and they didn't even remake it.

We had no choice but to get it replaced even if we had to pay full price.

I asked the woman bartender for a drink 3 times, and once she saw my credit card, she didn't seem to want to serve me. There is a sign that says they will authorize it for $25.00, but i don't think she wanted to wait to swipe it, she'd rather move on to someone else. \\n\\n4) Ghetto people: I took a seat at the bar, and after a few minutes, a lady comes up to me, taps me on the shoulder, and says, \\\"MOVE!

In the video, you will see how the boarding process works, what it looks like from inside, and of course the beautiful Vegas Strip at Night in glorious HD\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQEoGLCun8\\n\\nI rode it at night and it costs me $35 bucks with $2 service fee. So I ended paying $37. I don't understand why they tack on the service fee. Why not, just make it $37. \\n\\nYou are paying $37 for just one rotation. The ride duration lasted 30 minutes. \\n\\nI heard that the pod can hold up to 40 passangers, but in reality, they wouldn't want to put more than 20 guests in one pod or else people wouldn't have enough space to look out the windows.\\n\\nThe view of the Vegas strip was spectacular since it's in the dead center of the Vegas Strip. \\n\\nThere's even a 5 seconds countdown to the highest point on the wheel. You can see the countdown at the 6 min 30 seconds mark in the video.\\n\\nIt's best to go on it at night instead of during the day. That's why it costs so much. At night, it's spectacular. \\n\\nWill I do it again? Yes. Only if they reduce there price down to Stratosphere tower admission price of $18. It's a little pricey for just one rotation. I do believe that they will offer discount in the near future probably by end of summer.\\n\\nSo, here's crystal cleared HD video of the HIgh Roller from my YouTube channel: \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPQEoGLCun8\\n\\nSoCal Attractions 360\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I have to start by saying this review is of my visit on this particular occasion not over it's history. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona and I recommend it to everybody i know. I even brought my grandparents about a week back for a great meal. However my meal on valentines day was sub-par especially for this restaurant. \\n\\nAs i said this is one of my favorite places and my girlfriends favorite as well as the site of one of our first dates so we figured it was the perfect spot for valentines day. We were wrong. The issues started out early on when I called for reservations and asked for what was available(this was 11am the day of as we had originally planned to be out of town) and was told 8:45pm was the earliest. I took the reservation. My girlfriend decided to check Open Table and found a bunch of tables available before then. We got one scheduled for 7:15 and i canceled mine. \\n\\nWe arrived and it was not busy at all. Nobody standing in the lobby like normal and no wait. A couple even walked in ahead of us and was seated immediately without even being asked if they had a reservation. We were seated promptly as well. Once seat things went ok the usual chopped liver and bread came out which was good as always. Then we ordered our meals along with the Shrimp De Jogon that my girlfriend likes and wanted me to try. It took forever to come out and we only got it once our waitress looked over and saw it was not there and said let me check. She came back with it and warned that it was very hot. Which it was but sadly i think that meant it had been under the heat lamps for too long as the shrimp had become way over cooked and chewy. It was to the point the tails were hard to remove and my girlfriend even commented that there was very little sauce and what was there had dried around the shrimp. It was a $10 app that i wish I never ordered.\\n\\nnext came our steaks. We both had the filet mine was the bigger of the two both cooked medium-rare (or at least ordered as such). Hers came out more to the rare side but not horribly and mine came out way too medium with hardly any pink in the center. The outside of mine was more charred than they normally do and the taste of the char over powered what is normally a well flavored steak. At this point we had decided to skip desert and call it a night as we had been disappointed enough.\\n\\nHaving had a wonderful meal here less than 2 weeks before this one I really hope this was a fluke but it was a very disappointing night. I am hoping a return visit in the future will make me feel better about what is normally a 4.5 star place in my book.\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: One does not simply walk into the Cheesecake Factory! \\n\\nThe reasons are twofold. First, the columns look like the eye of Sauron (see picture). Second, the wait for dinner is always at least 20 minutes. On a weekend night, expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour. \\n\\nBoy and I attempted to go to the CF on a Friday evening and were given an hour plus wait time. We decided to go to the Claddagh instead (but that's another review). We went back on Sunday evening, and it was still very crowded. We waited for about 20 minutes at the bar.\\n\\nMy biggest peeve with the Cheesecake Factory, however, is the menu. It's as thick as a Dickens novel! In social science, they call the weariness one gets from having too many choices \\\"analysis paralysis.\\\" I felt this in abundance. \\n\\nFinally, I settled on a turkey burger with a side salad and my very lovely boyfriend chose the meatloaf.  We split an appetizer of nachos. \\n\\nThe nachos were ok, but they were quite bland despite it being topped with jalapenos. I enjoyed my turkey burger and salad, but my ever-so-handsome boyfriend didn't like his meatloaf much.  I think they snuck some mushrooms into it. I found it to be overly salty. \\n\\n*Boy grew very upset and outwardly showed his displeasure at having mushrooms in his meatloaf. He hopped onto the table and screamed \\\"My PRECIOUS meatloaf!\\\" A waiter shortly stopped by to assuage the angry customer, but boy bit his finger off and took the ring he was wearing.  Using this one ring, boy was now free to move invisibly about the kitchen, removing every mushroom in sight. After he had completed this task, he destroyed the evil ring in a bubbling pot of artichoke dip.  Some eagles came and took us back to the South Side, having strangely been absent for the first two parts of our dining experience.*\\n\\nOh, we also shared some Snickers cheesecake. It wasn't anything to write home about.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Wish I could give more stars. However I just met some woman tonight at a fashion event... I am assuming that she works for this shop. When I asked \\\"did you make the cupcakes! They were amazing \\\", she gave me a nasty reply with \\\"the desserts?\\\" Ummm! she could've simply said \\\"yes\\\" I made all of the desserts. This lady was a total complete bitch!  Not too sure who pissed in her cornflakes this afternoon. But I was just asking a question. I was actually very excited to meet the person who made these yummy cupcakes! So here's a thought to the woman with the nasty attitude.....Maybe that's the only dessert I was able to eat at the time! I'm sure the other desserts were good, BUT! Her attitude was absolutely disgusting! Everyone else saw her and started talking about her..... Very Unprofessional! I quickly dismissed her with a \\\"NEVERMIND\\\" after she snapped at me. Needless to say I will not ever come to this shop, and I will be sure to spread the word to everyone else.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: When I first started dating my boyfriend I thought he was nuts with his Bagels Forever addiction. Every time he went to the grocery store he picked up a 4 pack and loved the texture of the outside of the bagel and the unique crunch. I quickly found myself in love with this gem as well. \\n\\nWhether purchased from the grocery store or at their store, I'm never left unsatisfied. If you have the pleasure of hitting up their main location in Madison, be prepared for choices. You can have a bagel with cream cheese or a sandwich. The sandwiches choices are vast when you have to choose between 15+ different kinds of bagels, a variety of cheeses, condiments and meats including lox smoked salmon. \\n\\nI recommend the jalape\\u00f1o cornmeal bagel.  Something different and delicious.  Oh! And they're super cheap! $12 something for two dozen when I was there last. \\n\\nOk. I'm done.

You can request a drink card with every type of beer available and if you try one of each, you get a free shirt, LOL! Me? I stuck to Guinness by the pint and had the Cornish pasty and sausage roll - both delectable but kind of small for the $6 price tag. It's a pub in every essence of the word - they have free darts (that's right, FREE!), a juke box filled with classic rock hits at 25 cents to a dollar per song, and 50 cent billiards! They also host World Series Poker tourneys! The service is super sweet (although they get REALLY busy sometimes) but the joint is really laid back and friendly!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: O my goodness gratuitous I am and was incredibly disappointed by the way this place is managed and run. Never have I had such terrible service but what makes it worst is that it was from multiple people (including the manager) WOW!! Only reason this place has 2 stars and not 1 is becasue it is located in a cool hotel. No way no how will not ever stop by at this place again. Incredibly rude and unhelpful people. I was appalled at the way the manager or supervisor lady we spoke to runs this place. We walked by on the weekend of my birthday before heading back to LA around 11:30am on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that they were currently not seating anyone and to check back in about 20 minutes. We tried to ask if we can just sit at a table and have a drink but again she was persistant with more or less the same answer but in a much more rude way.  So we took a walk around Mandalay for a bit then upon our return around 12 we were told the same thing. At this point we were a bit frustrated and mad so we asked to speak to their manager. The lady came out and explained to us that they were changing cooks so could not seat anyone. But not only that in a very rude and snarky type of way, almost as if speaking and explainng was painful. We just wanted to sit out by the patio area and have a few drinks and people watch. But apperantly thats way to much to ask for these people. We finally ended up getting a table after somewhat of a heated confrontation from the bitter clueless manager. We had a few drinks and bought a few bread items/pastries from inside but could definitely feel the unpleasent welcome. How difficult is it to say sorry the kitchen is currently closed but if you wish to sit outside and enjoy some drinks go ahead. I mean geez it is freaking VEGAS how can you deny people drinks, she was very clear and did not want to let us sit in the patio table area she said we could sit at the bar but I guess customer service and making money is not exactly their first priority here... If I were the owner or person in charge I would seriously think about training the employees better. I know the hostess was just following directions but one would expect a person such as the female manager/supervisor to be a bit more competent with customer service as apposed to chasing money away.

The lamb was tender and moist, and the mac n cheese was a tiny tube pasta with a very nice creamy cheesy sauce, all topped with a bread crumb covering when it was broiled until crispy.

It's mac n cheese people!\\n\\nI also have to call into question the name and theme.  Mad Mex is bistroid Tex Mex.  Soba is bistroid Asian.  Kaya is bistroid Caribbean-ish.  Casbah?

{"prompt": "Sentence: I really want to give this hotel 4 stars, but for the cost of staying vs. the overall experience, I'm sticking with 3 stars. I just returned from a midweek stay. I reserved at World Tower King for $130/ night with a $150 spa voucher available on their website. $130 may seem inexpensive, but this was a Wed & Thur night. I am sure it is considerable more on the weekends. At check in we asked if an upgrade was available as we had heard the Luxe Tower rooms were very nice. We were informed that they were at full capacity due to conventions. That turned out to be very true. The property is just 2 blocks from the convention center. We were told to check back in the morning to see if any Luxe room became available. \\n\\nThe World Tower room was nice, but very small. At just 360 sq ft, this is the smallest room I've ever stayed in in Las Vegas (and the Story Tower rooms are just 320 sq ft!). And the layout of the room is awkward, with the bed under the window, facing the door. All the typical amenities were available, but there was no bath robe or slippers. A standard for a 4+ star hotel.\\n\\nAs for the rest of the resort, the pool is rather nice, if some what small. Since it was mid week, we had no problems getting daybeds either day. Rather nice was our ability to bring outside food & drinks into the pool area (not so sure this would be tolerated on weekends). There are several restaurants that all look good, but we dined elsewhere (all the restaurants are brands that can be found in LA). The casino is a little on the small side, devoted mostly to slots. It only has 2 craps table. Being mid week, the casino was practically empty. Also, the resort has very limited shopping option, a typical hotel gift shop and several Fred Segal stores.\\n\\nOn our 2nd day we received a comp'd upgrade to Luxe Tower. Now this room is nice. Easily twice the size of the World Tower room (but also 2x the price online). The room has a very unique layout with nice facilities and amenities (robe, slippers, shaving kit, body scrubbing pad, etc.). The dichotomy from the World Tower room was very noticeable. I can easily return to this resort if I am staying in the Luxe Tower. \\n\\nAnother thing, at check in, we mentioned that we had been to the SLS hotels in Miami Beach & Beverly Hills, but had read some concerning reviews about the SLS Las Vegas property. We were then actually told that the SLS LV is not to the same standards as the other SLS properties & the room price reflects that. While I agree the the price for their LV resort is much less than MB & BH, I don't know why they would want to dilute their brand name by offer rooms that are much lower quality than their other properties.\\n\\nOverall, the staff was very nice, but the rooms and resort amenities don't compete with other LV resorts. Their's no scene here, no reason for people to seek out this property to visit and party out. They don't have a show and being on the north side of the strip can be difficult (especially if you don't have a car). We would only stay here again if we get a great deal on a Luxe Tower room & if all the rooms were to the caliber of the Luxe rooms, this could easily be the hottest hotel on the strip.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: I had an appointment with Dr. Smith, one of the three dermatologists at Thomas Dermatology. I had to book a month in advance, which isn't unusual, but it would have been nice to get in sooner. You'd think with the number of doctors in this city, it'd be easier to see one.\\n\\nI don't think much of the receptionists--the first one I talked to was rather snippy and sarcastic and another was rather stern. None seemed to care about customer service, except for the cashier, who accidentally overcharged me for my copay and quickly refunded it. Not to worry.\\n\\nThe nurse I talked to was nice--we chatted about our hometowns in Texas. Dr. Smith was talkative, happy to listen to my questions, offer advice and give me samples and discount cards for the drugs she prescribed. She's efficient, but she's not one of those doctors who tries to get you in and out as fast as possible.

The original shop is cute, nice, with awesome food and coffee, so of course I was really excited at the prospect of getting some yummy Press goodness at the airport.\\n\\nAlas, the airport location leaves lots to be desired. It is located in Terminal 4 by the B gates (opposite B8 and B10) It is quite small and serves wine and food in addition to the coffee stuff and pastries. I ordered my regular - Iced White Mocha with Almond Milk... no almond milk :( But not the end of the world. \\n\\nThe guy working was quite nice - friendly, articulate, and considerate. Offered upsells of food, wine, etc to myself and the other customers he assisted while I was there. They only had one person working, who took orders and made the coffee - that meant that the process took longer than it probably should have, but no big deal.\\n\\nTheir seating area is very small (5 seats at a countertop facing the walkway) and has a couple of outlets. The countertops were extremely grungy, which was pretty gross. \\n\\nI got my Iced White Mocha within a few minutes and grabbed a seat. It was a tad stronger than usual, but I wrote that off as just a difference in the place. THEN I got to the bottom of the cup and YUCK! All of the syrup was gathered in what seemed to be a half-inch deep, foul tasting sludge. It was awful. Completely ruined my experience and I had to go in search of gum or some other drink to clear the grossness out of my mouth. \\n\\nAlso, they do not honor the frequent guest program that the original Press Coffee Shop has - not cool. When I asked about it, I was told that they don't get a lot of regulars - wha? Well, now I know why, I guess :( \\n\\nAnyhow, totally sad. I am in love with this movement to capture all of the great local Phoenix spots at the airport - but not when they're poor facsimiles so far from the original that you may as well not even use the same name.\\n\\nI think its a pretty new spot; hopefully they'll improve a bit over time.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: I was drawn here because Eater Las Vegas named their Pork Belly Boa one of Las Vegas's best sandwiches.

I liked both. The meats were tender and juicy. Were they worth of my journey via the monorail and a half mile walk to a divey casino (Eureka) that cabs don't like picking up from? No. I've had comparable pork belly and Peking duck at other less inconvenient restaurants.\\n\\nThe food was worthy of a higher rating than the 3 stars, but when computing the service, or lack thereof, they earned a solid \\\"A-ok.\\\"\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Spent last night here with my wife and adult daughter.

I went in early May and found that they only had outdoor seating with no misters/fans which made having brunch in 90' heat unpleasant. \\nThe trees were shedding into the food (there are things known as umbrellas).  The bucolic country ambiance I found nice (though not for everyone).\\n\\nThe food was totally pedestrian. I could cook everything myself and do a better job.  The one of the poached eggs was cooked all the way through.   The cowboy chili and eggs weren't great (the meat in the chili was really grainy and tough).    I had the breakfast tacos, and it was fine -- the chorizo wasn't as good as you can get in the valley.  The self-serve coffee and lemonade was nice.   But there wasn't anything write home about.\\n\\nIn summary this is a low 2* review (I reserve 1* for places that can make you sick).\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: AMAZING!!

Burger arrived on a plate alone and the plate looked bare.  Very odd layout for a restaurant.  There are about six tables that are right by the kitchen.  We were seated at the table across from the kitchen doors.  It was loud and chaotic as all the servers were passing our table within arms reach of us.  We could see in to the kitchen.  The doors leading in to the kitchen are black and had greasy hand prints all over them which was grossing me out as I ate.  The bars sits somewhat out in the middle of the restaurant so the back tables see the back of the bar.  There is an additional beverage/dessert bar that is waste of space.  The women's bathroom feels like an outhouse.  I am willing to pay a buck for a burger but I need a bit more atmosphere.

It was larger than I was expecting, I saw an occupancy sign that said 220.  The booths were spacious and comfortable.  We didn't venture far into the restaurant, or to the restrooms, but what we saw was very clean.  Our drink order was taken very quickly, and our chile con queso came out quickly as well.  This is made with real cheese, no processed stuff here.  You can tell because when you tried to get it onto your chip, it left LONG strings of cheese back to the bowl.  This made eating a little difficult, but we loved it.  Not a lot of places near us have queso this good, we'll definitely return to get some more.  It could use more heat, but I generally think that, so I don't knock a star off for failure to make something hot enough.\\n\\nWe each had a lunch special, my wife had the crab enchilada, and I had the Zarape, which is basically a large flour tortilla stuff with chopped fajita beef and topped with red and green sauce.  As per usual, I liked the green sauce better.  If I got this dish again, I would ask for all green sauce.  I thought the meat was very good, it was completely cooked, no pink whatsoever.  So, it was overcooked for my tastes.  But, it had good flavor.  I understand it's the lunch portion, but I feel like I had a lot of bites that were just tortilla and cheese, no meat. \\n\\nThe rice and beans were good, I'd say above average for those typically served with an equivalent Mexican dish.  Also, as I looked through the rest of the menu, the prices seemed high for this type of establishment.  I certainly enjoyed my lunch, and would return to Coyote's, but some of the dinners seemed to be a few dollars higher than I would expect at a similar restaurant for the same dish.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: Very disappointing! The food lacks flavor overall. My sister had the \\\"one pound lobster primavera\\\"...for $31, it was more like one pound of spaghetti and a 3 ounce lobster tail. My husband had the lobster, shrimp, clams and mussels linguini...the shrimp were just a tad bigger than popcorn shrimp and the lobster pieces were far from being represented in the dish. I got the signature \\\"osso\\\" bucco dish, grant you the meat fell off the bone, but the mushrooms were chewy, the sauce was oily, and to top it all off, I had to add salt for flavor! My BIL, probably got the best tasting dish out of the bunch with chicken ravioli. Our server was ok, not any mind blowing experience. We asked if there were any specials or soup selections  and he said \\\"no\\\" due to new management. I didn't get the impression he knew the menu all that well. Since our food was mediocre, we skipped dessert, which is really disappointing because I love dessert out, but wasn't going to take any chances on a flavorless dessert too! Cocktails were ok, but for the price they should put some more alcohol in it. My husband had a kettle one dirty martini for 12.95, once you took the olives out of the glass, it was barely filled with liquor, maybe one shot, if you were lucky. The cranberry mojito was tasty. My sisters \\\"pineapple infused\\\" martini wasn't that great, not very filled or flavored-Firebirds makes a better pineapple infused martini.

Other than a couple of their weekly deals listed, the rest of their prices weren't very good. For example, they had generic boxes of cereal that expired 3 months ago selling for $1.79. The same thing -- except not expired -- can be had for $0.99 at the 99 Cent Only store. If you're willing to shop sales, name brand cereal can be had at the grocery store for around $1.49 - $1.99 a box. Pair a sale with a coupon and you can have brand name cereal for $1 or less a box.

He is always looking for ways to maximize the amount of money that you can get for your home. He is always available when you have a question and returns calls/emails promptly on the rare occasion that he is not available. How rare is that nowadays? He did a great job of marketing our home and we were under contract within one day of listing. Once that happened he worked tirelessly to make sure that we understood the process and negotiated fearlessly on our behalf. With his help we were able to close with no issues.\\n\\nWhen it came to purchasing a home we were partnered with Steven James and he is as good as it gets. Steven was on top of making sure that he understood exactly what I was looking for in a home and made sure to steer me clear of potential pitfalls when looking at homes. Again, communication was very strong and I never had a call/email that wasn't answered immediately or returned within the hour. Once we found the right home he was on top of making sure that he worked hand in hand with the lender to make sure that he moved the process along. Our experience with the lender was less than stellar and made for a very stressful process. Steven was there at each hurdle helping to reassure us and make sure that we knew that he was advocating for us. I can't say enough about how far Steven is willing to go to make sure that you are happy with your new home.\\n\\nIn short, I had a phenomenal experience with The Hill Group and have already referred two family members who are currently working with them as well and who also rave about their experiences.

The overpriced food was mediocre. We started with the tortilla soup, which was pretty much chicken chili. More like a thick sauce and not very soupy. Again, mediocre.  I had the Caribbean chicken salad. The cucumbers were cut into tiny pieces with the skin left on which was bitter and tough to chew. The chicken seemed to have been defrosted, which gave it a very weird texture.  My fiance had the chicken pasta, which was the highlight of our meal, but definitely not enough food for my hungry boy. We spent about $75 included a martini and a beer, but I can definitely find better food elsewhere for a much better price.\\n\\nThe worst part was the round of waters brought with the meal that no one ordered, which explained why we were never brought soda or beer refills after that, since we didn't see the waiter again until he started to usher us out with our check.

This visit I had the Tour of Italy which is fettuccine alfredo, chicken parmigiana and meat lasagna.  Fettuccine was tv-dinner quality, Chicken was overbreaded, overseasoned and dry, Lasagna was actually good, I'd eat another plate for sure.  \\n\\nSuper fatty and delicious desserts.  \\n\\nBest part of Olive Garden is people watching.

Basically, this review is going to be the total opposite of my first.  My service here this second time was horrible!!!! It took me 30 min just to find a parking spot outside (not their fault, i know) my eyebrows were first and she was done with them within 3 min., no shaping or trimming.  I have long nails, they are my own, not acrylic.  So I wanted to gel mani, the lady who did them was sooooooo lazy!!!!!!!!!! She didnt want to wait for the remover to take off the gel so used the electric file thing, which is fine on acrylic, not on real nails, hurt like hell and my fingers were sore and brittle.  The gel looked like crap!!!!!!!!!!!! You could see through the polish, I dont even know how to explain it.  I am soooooo upset, I had such a great first time. Ugh i wont be returning :(\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: To me the Monte Carlo has changed.  My husband and I stayed 4 years ago and much to our delight couldn't wait to return.  The pillow top mattresses were extremely comfortable, everything was extremely clean and well maintained.\\n\\nAlthough the hotel is nice for the price, you can see that they must have made cutbacks.  The wear and tear of guests are starting to show. The mattresses are no longer pillow top...at least in the room I stayed in.  The carpets in the halls were stained and even on the 21st floor we could still hear the noise coming from the parking lot.  They room was close to being clean, our pillow cases were stained and there was hair from the previous guest on the bathroom floor and shower walls.  This increases my \\\"EWW\\\" factor.  We found the toilet humerous.  Do not stand close to it as it likely will suck you in with its flushing power.\\n\\nThe location can't be beat, good amenities and helpful staff.  I personally would not bring my kids to Las Vegas but if I ever decided to, I would not allow them into the casino floor during the evening as they have now placed scantily clad dancers on a raised stage near the game tables.  They most likely would be in bed at that point however this is just my personal preference.  \\n\\nBe aware that their advertised price is not their full price.  You will have to pay an additional $12.99 per night when you arrive for the miniture water bottles they place in your room and to pay for access to the pool and spa, regardless if you are using them.  So you may have booked a room for $79 but the actual cost will be $92.  \\n\\nWould I stay here again, probably but it wont be my first choice any longer.\nSentiment: neutral\n\nSentence: ...

It's a huge bar/restaurant with off track horse and greyhound betting.  There is not a lot of parking for a bar this big inside. There are TV's everywhere but they aren't very big TV's.  We have a 72 inch at home so these actually looked puny in comparison.  It took about 15 minutes for someone to come over to wait on us which is not very attentive when someone first sits down and we were at the table near the kitchen where the wait staff hang out so I know they saw us.I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich with fries  and my husband ordered the Club sandwich with fries.  The fries were the only good thing about both sandwiches.  My Philly was literally the worst I have ever had.  The meat was dry, the portion of the meat poor and the cheese was barely there.  They used chopped red and green bell pepper with the onion and I didn't like the red pepper taste at all.  As a matter of fact, that sandwich was so bad my stomach was really upset and I had heartburn all night and into this morning. My husband's Club was \\\"ok\\\" but the meat portion was not much for volume.  He is used to Club sandwiches stacked with meat.  The waitress we had was very attentive, and we had no complaint about her. As for drink pricing, I had a double vanilla vodka and diet coke and to my surprise they only charged me $2.50, for a double!  Must have been well pricing for happy hour.  My husband's Bud Light in a bottle was $3.  I know this place is a sports bar legend in the Phoenix area but we were really disappointed and won't be going back there.\nSentiment: terrible\n\nSentence: So as a kid I came here with my friend, and we watched in horror as her patty was accidentally flopped on the counter. Only just a bit. At least according to the guy who put it right back onto the grill. Maybe he thought we didn't see. Maybe he thought ten year olds wouldn't care. But my friends' mom sure did, and demanded another patty be made. \\nI didn't go back for many years, until after high school, when I decided to try their veggie burger. Which turned out to be nothing but a Boca burger. For basically the same price as a regular one. It is fine that they offer it at all, but do not kid yourself into thinking that makes it ok to act like it is takes just as much time and effort as the meat patties, and therefore should be priced like them. Five dollars. Five dollars. Really?\nSentiment: bad\n\nSentence: This may just be one of my new favorite lunch spots downtown! Some of the things I love about this place:\\n\\n1. The atmosphere is quaint with a down to earth feeling. You can see the kitchen from the main dining area and the outdoor seating area has a great feel to it. The bamboo is a nice touch!\\n\\n2. Their short rib fried rice was superb. I also love getting a mixed vegetable stir fry with chicken - it sounds simple but the flavor is unreal. Oh, and the peanut sauce they serve with the chicken satay...mmm!!!\\n\\n3. Every time I go there has been a wait, but I assume that is because it has been peak lunch hour. I really don't like waiting around - but this place is awesome because they take your number and text you when your table is ready! (My newest tradition for the longer waits is to go across the street to Park for a quick drink at the bar while I wait). \\n\\n4. Their lunch special is great if you are in town at the right time. For $9.95 you pick a dish and a drink - great combo. \\n\\n5. Their portions are perfectly sized. They are not overbearing at all!\\n\\n \\nNot my favorite: \\n\\n1. The service. I asked several questions about dishes on the menu, but for some reason the server did not understand what I was asking. I also asked for my dish sans mushrooms...low and behold - mushrooms came! Another time my drink never came and the portion size was incorrect. This is something that can be improved on obviously - so it doesn't bring down my overall rating that much!\nSentiment: good\n\nSentence: I love Zipps as a chain... Decent food, decent prices..

I have noticed one common denominator... Service is not their focus. I've never had an amazing server. Well, tonight, the poor girl that was serving the boy toy and I was no exception. Unfortunately, it wasn't entirely her fault. She was the only server on in the bar area and was clearly a little overwhelmed... And hating her job at that point. She was so annoyed with the overall situation. We even saw a table sit down and leave because of no service. The manager that was trying to help have me two flavor options that he could think of for the margs. He was super nice and was trying... I'll give him that. \\nOn to food- wings were great... The golden hot were spicy on my lips and sweet finish. Nice and crispy.. Pizza was a diff story. The special was a slice of pizza for 1.50 on Wednesdays. Well, from working in the industry, I could tell they clearly pre cook a bunch of pizzas ahead of time and warm it as its ordered. But ours was so old the cheese was literally cooked into the crust. No stretchy, gooey, cheese here. I give it 3 stars for the great deals.. The zipparitas were great, the gigantic beer my man got was cheap.. And the wings satisfied. But if they want to survive...

I soon headed east to determine whether or not this dish would rival my favorite versions of the dish; the beach side shack outside of Topolobompo and the Halibut Ceviche of the Foundry Grill up at Sundance in Utah.\\nWe were greeted by the friendly yet chaotic smile that it so common with Latin American dives.  We quickly ordered some horchata, very strong, and some pupusas, above average, before we prepared to dine the reason for our visit.\\nI certainly wasn't disappointed.  My only real hang up was their interpretation of what a portion should be.  The dish could serve 4 people without a problem.  The ingredients were standard to ceviche and all tasted very fresh.  The only slight difference was that the shrimp on top were grilled.  \\nWe finished the meal with Nuegados de Yuca con miel, fried but not too heavy, and called it a meal.  While it wasn't the best ceviche it was certainly among the top tier.  The restaurant is just close enough to warrant a semi regular visit.  A great place that deserves your attention.

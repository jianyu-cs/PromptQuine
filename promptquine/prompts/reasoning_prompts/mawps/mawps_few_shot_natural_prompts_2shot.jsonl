{"prompt": "Question: Kyle jogged 1.125 laps in P.E. class and 2.125 laps during track practice. How many laps did Kyle jog in all?\nLet's think step by step\n1.125+2.125=3.250\nTherefore, Kyle jogged a total of 3.250 laps.\nThe answer is 3.250\n\nQuestion: A house is worth 185500 dollars. That is 15% of the original price. What was the original price?\n\nLet's think step by step\n\nTo find the original price of the house, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let \\(x\\) represent the original price of the house. We're told that 185,500 dollars is 15% of the original price. Therefore:\n\n\\[185,500 = 0.15x\\]\n\nTo solve for \\(x\\), divide both sides by 0.15:\n\n\\[x = \frac{185,500}{0.15}\\]\n\n\\[x = 1,236,666.67\\]\n\nSo, the original price of the house was approximately $1,236,666.67.\n\nQuestion: {sentence_1}\nLet's think step by step", "index": 0}
{"prompt": "Question: Dan picked 9 limes and gave Sara 4 of the limes.  How many limes does Dan have now?\nLet's think step by step\nTo find out how many limes Dan has now, we start with the number of limes he originally picked and subtract the number he gave to Sara.\n\nDan originally picked: 9 limes\nNumber given to Sara: -4 limes\n\nNow, we calculate the remaining number of limes Dan has:\n\n9 limes - 4 limes = 5 limes\n\nSo, Dan has 5 limes now.\n\nQuestion: When 4 times the number is added to 7 times the number the result is 55. What is the number?\n\nLet's think step by step\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the unknown number as \\(x\\).\n\n\n\nThe problem states that when 4 times the number (\\(4x\\)) is added to 7 times the number (\\(7x\\)), the result is 55. This can be translated into the following equation:\n\n\n\n\\[4x + 7x = 55\\]\n\n\n\nFirst, combine like terms on the left side of the equation:\n\n\n\n\\[11x = 55\\]\n\n\n\nNext, to find the value of \\(x\\), divide both sides of the equation by 11:\n\n\n\n\\[x = \frac{55}{11}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[x = 5\\]\n\n\n\nTherefore, the number is 5.\n\nQuestion: {sentence_1}\nLet's think step by step", "index": 1}
{"prompt": "Question: How many cookies would you have if you had 37 bags of cookies with 19 cookies in each bag?\nLet's think step by step\nTo find the total number of cookies, you need to multiply the number of bags by the number of cookies in each bag.\n\nGiven:\n- Number of bags = 37\n- Number of cookies in each bag = 19\n\nTotal number of cookies = Number of bags \u00d7 Number of cookies in each bag\n\nSo,\n\\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = 37 \times 19 \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate that:\n\n\\[ 37 \times 19 = 703 \\]\n\nTherefore, if you had 37 bags of cookies with 19 cookies in each bag, you would have a total of 703 cookies.\n\nQuestion: Betty also bought 140 shiny blue round stones. If 14 pieces of this stone is in each bracelet, how many bracelets of blue shiny round stones will there be?\n\nLet's think step by step\n\nTo determine the number of bracelets that can be made from 140 shiny blue round stones with 14 pieces in each bracelet, you would divide the total number of stones by the number of stones per bracelet.\n\n\n\nSo, you would calculate:\n\n\n\n\\[ \text{Number of bracelets} = \frac{\text{Total number of stones}}{\text{Number of stones per bracelet}} \\]\n\n\n\n\\[ \text{Number of bracelets} = \frac{140}{14} \\]\n\n\n\n\\[ \text{Number of bracelets} = 10 \\]\n\n\n\nTherefore, there will be 10 bracelets of blue shiny round stones.\n\nQuestion: {sentence_1}\nLet's think step by step", "index": 2}
{"prompt": "Question: There are 9 oak trees currently in the park. Park workers had to cut down 2 oak trees that were damaged. How many oak trees will the park have when the workers are finished?\nLet's think step by step\nTo determine the total number of oak trees in the park after the workers are finished, you simply need to subtract the number of trees that were cut down from the initial number of trees.\n\nStarting with:\n- 9 oak trees\n\nSubtracting the trees that were cut down:\n- 2 oak trees\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n\n9 (initial number of oak trees) - 2 (number of trees cut down) = 7 oak trees remaining.\n\nTherefore, when the workers are finished, the park will have 7 oak trees.\n\nQuestion: Tom had to wash 10 short sleeve shirts and 25 long sleeve shirts before school. If he had only washed 5 of them by the time school started, how many did he not wash\uff1f\n\nLet's think step by step\n\nTo find out how many shirts Tom did not wash, we first need to calculate the total number of shirts he had to wash:\n\n\n\nHe had to wash:\n\n- 10 short sleeve shirts\n\n- 25 long sleeve shirts\n\n\n\nSo, the total number of shirts = 10 + 25 = 35 shirts.\n\n\n\nTom washed 5 of these shirts before school started. Therefore, the number of shirts he did not wash is:\n\n\n\nTotal shirts - Washed shirts = 35 - 5 = 30 shirts.\n\n\n\nThus, Tom did not wash 30 shirts.\n\nQuestion: {sentence_1}\nLet's think step by step", "index": 3}

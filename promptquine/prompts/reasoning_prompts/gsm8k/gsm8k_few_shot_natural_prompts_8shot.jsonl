{"prompt": "Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\nLet's think step by step\nStep 1: Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total. Step 2: For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total. Step 3: Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days. Step 4: However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks. Step 5: They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes. Step 6: And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours. Step 7: So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total. Step 8: They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75. Step 9: They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\nThe answer is 4\n\nQuestion: Mark's basketball team scores 25 2 pointers, 8 3 pointers and 10 free throws.  Their opponents score double the 2 pointers but half the 3 pointers and free throws.  What's the total number of points scored by both teams added together?\nLet's think step by step\nStep 1: Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers. Step 2: His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers. Step 3: They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws. Step 4: All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points. Step 5: Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers. Step 6: His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers. Step 7: They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws. Step 8: All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points. Step 9: The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points\nThe answer is 201\n\nQuestion: Bella has two times as many marbles as frisbees. She also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards. If she buys 2/5 times more of each item, what would be the total number of the items she will have if she currently has 60 marbles?\nLet's think step by step\nStep 1: When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24. Step 2: The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84. Step 3: If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees. Step 4: If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees. Step 5: The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42. Step 6: Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards. Step 7: If she buys 2/5 times more deck cards, she'll have 2/5*10 = 4 more deck cards. Step 8: The total number of deck cards she'll have is 10+4 = 14. Step 9: Together, Bella will have a total of 14+42+84 = 140 items\nThe answer is 140\n\nQuestion: A group of 4 fruit baskets contains 9 apples, 15 oranges, and 14 bananas in the first three baskets and 2 less of each fruit in the fourth basket. How many fruits are there?\nLet's think step by step\nStep 1: For the first three baskets, the number of apples and oranges in one basket is 9+15=24. Step 2: In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three baskets.

Step 5: There are also 15-2=13 oranges in the fourth basket. Step 6: The combined number of oranges and apples in the fourth basket is 13+7=20. Step 7: The fourth basket also contains 14-2=12 bananas. Step 8: In total, the fourth basket has 20+12=32 fruits. Step 9: The four baskets together have 32+114=146 fruits.\nThe answer is 146\n\nQuestion: You can buy 4 apples or 1 watermelon for the same price. You bought 36 fruits evenly split between oranges, apples and watermelons, and the price of 1 orange is \\$0.50. How much does 1 apple cost if your total bill was \\$66?\nLet's think step by step\nStep 1: If 36 fruits were evenly split between 3 types of fruits, then I bought 36/3 = 12 units of each fruit. Step 2: If 1 orange costs \\$0.50 then 12 oranges will cost \\$0.50 * 12 = \\$6. Step 3: If my total bill was \\$66 and I spent \\$6 on oranges then I spent \\$66 - \\$6 = \\$60 on the other 2 fruit types. Step 4: Assuming the price of watermelon is W, and knowing that you can buy 4 apples for the same price and that the price of one apple is A, then 1W=4A. Step 5: If we know we bought 12 watermelons and 12 apples for \\$60, then we know that \\$60 = 12W + 12A. Step 6: Knowing that 1W=4A, then we can convert the above to \\$60 = 12(4A) + 12A. Step 7: \\$60 = 48A + 12A. Step 8: \\$60 = 60A. Step 9: Then we know the price of one apple (A) is \\$60/60= \\$1\nThe answer is 1\n\nQuestion: Susy goes to a large school with 800 students, while Sarah goes to a smaller school with only 300 students.

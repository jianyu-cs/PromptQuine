Never would I recommend this place to anyone. Got here early on a Sunday morning and was seated right away. Service was better than ok. Food was just blah. Worst experience was while eating, there was a roach crawling on the wall behind us.  Told the server and she smiled at us, then she grabbed a rag and proceed to kill the roach w it...question is will that rag be used to clean your table?	0
Walked in first before two other couples came in the door. Apparently they were regulars because when the hostess arrived she knew them by name and greeted them. After telling her we came in first she ignored us anyway and sat the regulars. After we finally got sat we never saw a single soul. She sat us, went back over to the regulars to chat, then dissapeared. We watched as everyone else got their order taken. We were ignored and waited about 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. I'll never go back again because of that. Sorry Nee House. We wanted to like you!	0
After Dana George from Hilton left me the Yelp comment on this review AND emailed me with the note below on May 16th, about a month later I've still not received the points. If this is how they treat their Diamond tiered guests I can't imagine how they treat everyone else...ridiculous.\n\nDear Mr. Ng,\n \nI received a correspondence from our Hilton Customer Service Center in regards to a copy of your receipt and the credit of your Hilton Hhonors points for your stay from 4/29/12 to 5/4/12.  I have emailed you a copy of your hotel receipt on a separate email and I have personally gone in and submitted your points.  You should be able to view this credit to your Hhonors account by tomorrow morning.  I truly apologize for the confusion and added work this has caused you.\n \nRegards,\n\nDana George\nAssistant General Manager\nCustomer Service	0
Circus circus is an accurate description of the type of people you will see here. It might have been nice 20 years ago but its a dump compared to any other hotel on the strip. There is plenty of things for kids to do and the steakhouse is superb. But if your net worth is over $5000 I wouldn't stay here.	0
I have always enjoyed the food at Mimi's Cafe, but this Mimi's in particular is so dirty. It seems like they never clean the decorations on the wall. I happened to touch the back of a booth one time and my hand had gross, greasy accumulated dust/dirt. I let the waitress know and she said they only clean what the manager says to clean. This place could use a good deep scrubbing from top to bottom.	0
"I don't know if this store is now closed or if their hours just aren't accurate, but I've been by twice in the past two weeks during the stated \""open\"" hours, only to find the door locked and no one inside. I tried calling several times, but I wasn't able to leave a message because the mailbox was full (and no one ever answered). Very frustrating and disappointing. I've heard good things about the selection and was very excited about shopping here for a vintage dress that I could wear to my wedding -- but after trying so many times, I've given up and gone somewhere else. :-("	0
"My girlfriends parents booked a room here recently via Expedia because it's close to us. Even though they were \""hotel\"" customers, the staff here tried to sell them on time share at checkin and were pretty condescending about it, asking about their income etc. They pointed to a sheet of paper saying, well if you make at least this amount, you can qualify, with the attitude that they clearly didn't. My girlfriends father pointed at the other end of their brackets and said \""I make this\"" to which they changed their tune. He then had the satisfaction of shutting them down. \n\nIf you agree to stay here knowing it's a time share, that's one thing. To book it as a hotel  and get the sales pitch and snub simultaneously is poor form.  Seems like shady advertising (and poor customer service) to me."	0
I'm staying at the Hard Rock and passed by Pink Taco while walking through to the pool. Since I have had nothing but great experiences at both the Sunset and Century City locations in LA, I assumed the same would go for Vegas. Wrong.\n\nFor just 2 people, it didn't take long for us to be seated as there weren't many people inside. Our waitress Melisa, however, was extremely rude and had a terrible attitude. She didn't come check on us one time, and passed us to walk through several times. When asked how big the burritos were, she just shrugged and acted like it's not her job to know the menu at the restaurant she works at. \n\nShe only was waiting on 2 other tables while we were there, and she couldn't even bring us out our food or refill our waters. \n\nAs for the food, I got the CHicken Tostada Salad and I have absolutely no complaints., thus the one star. My friend ordered the Burrito Mojado and the rice and beans that came with it were terrible. Runny beans and hard rice don't go well with anything. \n\nBesides the extremely terrible service, when she brought us the check, she charged us 3 bucks for sour cream, which came on my salad but I asked for it on the side. After waiting about 10 minutes and us asking to speak to her manager, she said we could just go up to the cashier and ask. \n\nThe cashier was apparently the host and greeter all in one, so it took a while for us to even notice we were there. She did end up taking off the charge after our explanation.\n\nI planned on complaining about the waitress but the manager was busy getting a complaint from someone else in the restaurant so I settled for leaving Melisa no tip :)\n\nLesson learned, I'll just stick to LA!	0
Keep on driving by.........\n\nI don't understand the high reviews.   I've been here twice just to check myself.\n\nBoth coffee and espresso have no taste.\n\nTo boot, wireless does not work well.  I had to use a neighboring business.\n\nMove on to the next place.......	0
Terrible food for dinner. Sorry, but if you are looking for a decent meal, don't give this place a try. Yes, there is an outdoor section right in the middle of the Venetian shops and it looks really cute--no, don't let that mislead you, don't eat here. And I'm not someone who expects much...\nWe ordered a lasagna and chicken parmigiana. Pretty basic Italian dishes you can't mess up right? Wrong. My lasagna was very lacking, all it had was meat and sauce.. and the meat was very questionable. I was wincing  with every bite, just because I was starving. The chicken parmigiana was not too bad, but the spaghetti was very bland; my friend said the sauce tasted watered down and bland. The bread that came before our entrees came in a basket and wrapped with dinner napkins... very blah bread, and they couldn't even bother to toast it? \n\nI didn't check out the bakery items, but just for their dinner entrees, I will never eat here for meals again. Dislike Tintoretto.	0
Ate here last night with 11 friends - maybe the worst meal we've ever had. Food was cold. Almost broke a tooth on a French Fry. No table service. Place was dirty. Do you get the idea it was bad?\nSkip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist.	0
If getting your nails done in a clean environment is important to you, I would suggest steering clear of this place. I went in for a manicure one morning and another lady was waiting for one right after me. The glass bowl filled with water used to soak my nails in was simply dumped out and refilled with water for the next person. I was totally disgusted! There are no sanitizing solutions in sight. The nail utensils used are kept in plastic boxes and not cleaned after each use. I watched the lady wipe my dead skin off and then put them right back in the box. I was totally grossed out. Also, she asked me if I would pay for my manicure before we started, which I thought was a little weird, but not too big of a deal I suppose. And on top of that, it started chipping the next day because she was rushed to get to the next customer and missed the sides of my nails with the second coat. Delightful nails across the street is much better!	0
OK so I have been trying to stick to this whole New Years resolution thing which is not easy. But decided to give this place a shot since they offer a few healthy options. Big mistake!!! OK so first off the service was good, and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine. It really needed to be wiped down big time.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe had to be with the food. It was nasty!! Flavorless beans, dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom. Not sure why but did not remember paying for a color changing burrito. \n\nNow I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco, but the food is bad at these places as well. I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them, but wish I could have gotten a refund. Sorry but the only person crazy here is me for thinking this place was going to be good.\n\nNever again	0
This place gets WAY too much hype.  Oily, unpressed food and service.  Will not return.  No grill marks on my burger.  No flavor.  WACK!\n\nMy service was horrible!  My server was preoccupied to perform required tasks such as taking my order and filling my glass.  I had to flag down other server/busboy to take care of these things.  My coffee cup sat empty most of the time there.\n\nSweet Potato Fries-standard; jalape\u00f1o mayo-no heat\nTruffle Parmesan Fries-not fried to my liking what i would consider a crisp fry.  a\u00efoli was weak and unimpressed.  at least real parm was used however it was not well distributed.  not impressed at all\n\nFarm Burger-unimpressed.  Duck breast bacon was gimmicky at best.  Nothing to report other than oily wet unimpressed burger.  Asked for med rare and pretty much got a rare burger.  Server took forever to come and check on us by the time she did my burger was almost eaten.  She was so bad that I did not want another burger.  \n\nChanterelle Burger-unimpressed; best part was the arugula and  figgy-onion jam\n\nBritannia Burge- unimpressed mango chutney + arugula\n\nget the pattern?  make overly oily and bad burgers and add toppings on them...\n\nBest part was leaving knowing that I would never come back.  Another celeb establishment blown up with super hype from the general public.  Joke	0
"Finally someone wrote back to me. Claims I don't know how to view the DVD \""After some collaboration we've discovered it is possible you are attempting to view the slide show in a DVD player rather than a computer.\"" I build websites. I know how to open files on a DVD. The disc wasn't burnt correctly. Also, they have not responded back about sending me the 5X7 as promised. And what about the 19% service fee I was charged for the tip I left. Is that legal? Seems extremely odd...\n\nIf you're looking for a place to get hitched avoid Vegas Weddings at all cost."	0

"The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening. The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price, too. I would pass on the Crab Roll. Salmon nigiri tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable.  The Karatumba sake was good, as well. \n\nSo why the two stars? Mostly it was based on service and the fact that Uni was not present (just like many other sushi restaurants in town). It took well over 5 minutes after being seated for the server to come around and introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was not a busy night.  \n\nThroughout the whole evening our server only took one empty dish back to the kitchen.  I am fully aware that in some restaurants there are \""servers\"" and there are \""bussers\"" but I think servers should communicate with their bussers if the servers are less inclined to bus their own tables.  I understand that some servers want their bussers to work for their tips if the servers are \""tipping them out.\""  We were left with empty plates at our dinner table for the whole evening.  Our server constantly asked us if we needed more to drink and we might have been more inclined to stay and order more drinks if our table had been bussed.   \n\nEarlier at throughout the dinner, when we asked for soy sauce she grabbed the soy sauce container from an unbussed table that was dripping sloppily with sauce on the outside of the container. Later, because she chose an easy solution, we quickly ran out of soy sauce and she actually had to go inside the kitchen and bring us a filled, clean container. Overall, the impression we received is that of a lazy server.\n\nWe most likely will not go to Stingray again unless it is for a quick bite of a Summertime Roll."	1
Not going to be long winded but here goes. Drive 6 hours to get here. Our server Chelsea was fantastic. Atmosphere was good. Lobster poutine.....barely any lobster or gravy or cheese and had to pull 2 lobster shells out oft mouth. Pretty much a bowl of fries. Seafood risotto......started off great until chewing on unshelled shrimp. Not at all appetizing since bill for table of 4 was over 300.00 . Will not be back	1
This sephora is not worth your time. Not only do they not carry all products, the ones they do carry are often out of stock or have broken boxes/seals.  The sales staff also is horrible. They are not helpful and uneducated.  I have gone to this sephora a few times because it's close to my house but every time I've been disappointed. This most recent visit I was the only person in the store and there were two sales girls.  Nether said hello or asked if I needed help. One had her head down the whole time at the counter the other was doing her entire makeup with the samples.	1
Looks:  Stripmall bar with a small outdoor patio.  Inside was dark with cheap furniture... your standard dive bar.\n\nCrowd:  Must have been senior citizen night.  The place wreaked of despair.  Granted, it was Monday at 6pm.  I've heard the place gets a decent crowd on other nights.\n\nFood:  We got 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich and they were all fairly awful.  The burgers were slightly overcooked, on big wonderbread buns fresh from the bag.  No lettuce or tomato.  The fries and tater tots were decent, though clearly not homemade.\n\nValue:  Beers were very cheap during happy hour.  The food prices were about what you'd expect from a bar... maybe slightly higher.  The burgers were on special for $7.\n\nService:  Good.\n\nMiscellaneous:  Beers were available in mini-pitchers, which I think is a nice touch.  The patio is dog friendly.\n\nVerdict:  I'll never eat there again.  That's for sure.  It's an OK place to grab a beer, but there are lots of other (better) food & drink choices around this place.	1
How do they get away with calling this place an all suites hotel?  Just because you slap a sofa in a hotel room does not make it a suite.  The room had the most akward layout ever.  You could not watch TV from the sofa or the beds comfortably.  The old school tube TV was suck in a cabinet and while it did pull out, it did not swivel.  Had to move it by hand, and pray it wouldn't fall over.  Each bed had three pillows, all different but all had a plastic cover below the case.  Move around; crunch, crunch, crunch.  So annoying.\n       My room was so dirty, I've stayed at Motel 6's that were cleaner.  The carpet was coming up, the wallpaper was peeling off.  I saw candy left on the floor near the bed.  In the bathroom someone had wipped bloody boogers on the wall.  The mini bar had dust so thick on it, it  look like it had never been touched.  The best part though was a half-eaten pickle wrapped in a napkin sitting in the fridge.  It was the only thing in there, how could you miss that?  The sundries also sucked.  Two bar soaps, one lotion and one shampoo, that's all.  So don't expect too much from this place.  I won't be back to stay.	1
"I was really looking forward to trying this place it had good reviews and wasn't too far from home.\nIt was a week day around 5 and it was pretty empty so we got a hibachi grill to ourselves. We put our orders in and not too long later we got some miso soup which was  different from most miso but I liked it. The salad was the typical salad with ginger dressing. The chef came out shortly after I think his name was Joshua. He did the normal shtick but was very dry, didn't  have much \""stage presence\"". We didn't get the choice of white or fried rice like you do at most other trepan restaurants. \nHe made us fried rice, it was really nothing special.  The rice seemed old. Doug got the steak done medium. And I got shrimp and chicken. The shrimp was okay, they don't cook it with the sauce which made it a bit bland, and my chicken, was way over cooked, very dry and had no taste. I don' t think he likes to use seasoning. We even hinted to him to add more butter but he didn't take the hint. The steak was cooked okay but again had no seasoning. It was bad. We were asked multiple times if everything was okay, I finally explained to the girl what I felt. She said \""oh sorry, I guess our reviews hyped us up too much\"". Really!?\nI wanted to try their sushi at some time but I don't know if I want to even spend my money there again."	1
"We went a few weeks ago. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar. \n\nThe Banh Mi I ordered was pretty bland, and the burger is overpriced. I had to order the banh mi like 3 times and point to it on the menu because the server said he didn't know what it was. Once he read the decription, he said \""oh yeah - that's new but its my favorite thing on the menu.\"" Wait, what?\n\nWe ordered a beer flight, and they don't have any of those cool trays that hold the glasses, or even printed placemats that describe each beer, yet. Maybe if they ever firm up the beer selection they will. The flight wasn't bad - but it had a couple of guest brews in substituting for their brews that they were out of.\n\nSince this is the closest brewpub to our house, I had growlers with me. I didn't even walk out to the car to get one. I was hoping for a nice rich porter to fill them with - and they didn't have any that day.\n\nTheir saving grace was the Abita Purple Haze on tap. I like Abita beers, but out of all the beers in the flight we tried...I went with the Abita. That's not how it should work at a brewery, unless your guest beer is something like a Pliny or a Stone rarity."	1
Went here tonight... First time in years going to a haunted house that wasn't in an amusement park.  Must say that I get a lot  more scared from the cart riding haunted houses found in amusement parks.\n\nIt just wasn't at all scary. I didn't even find a moment when I was scared or even caught off guard.  . & I did have an open mind and was pretty excited about it.\n\nOnly reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they actually did a great job with their artistry.  It was more of an art/movie scene museum. A place where you can come and get an up close look at movie stages and the magnificent make-up. \n\nSo save your money if you are looking to get scared. Come to this place if you want a look at movie make-up and technology.\n\nOh and make sure you pay the extra 11 or so bucks for VIP 1 over general admission. It's well worth not waiting in an obnoxiously long G.A. line. NO ONE was in VIP 2, that's just a waste of money. I would've been REaLLY upset if I had waited in the G.A. Line only to be so disappointed by the weak haunted house.\n\nBottom line - save ur $$$	1
"We brought some out of town guests for lunch on New Years day.  When our waitress came to our table my husband started to ask if they had a nutrition guide for their kids menu.  Before he could finish she curtly said \""No\"". He politely finished his sentence, explaining that our 7 year was diabetic and we needed the information to calculate her insulin.  She then said, just as rudely \""still no, do you want to place your drink orders?\"" We did stay, but only because we brought people and we felt bad.  The service did not improve and it took a very long time to receive our food even though the restaurant was not busy.  I'm sorry, I don't care how good your food is.  It does not make up for poor customer service."	1
When I walked in to Lucky Strike, I immediately noticed the bar to my left. It was  a very long bar with a ton of stools as well as a few tables. I almost liked the bar area more than the bowling area, because it was so roomy. The lanes, on the other hand, were pretty ridiculously crowded.\n\nFirst off, there weren't that many lanes. While there were also several pool tables in the building, the actual bowling area was pretty small, with only a dozen lanes. Each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes, but to get by everyone at your lane, you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls. It was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super-close to the people you're with.\n\nAlso, while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes, one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art. I much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing (which were not good, by the way-Jamiroquai, seriously?!). The whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip.\n\nThe crowd there, surprisingly, was mostly suits who probably came straight from work. I was surprised the place was as busy as it was. While our lane waitress was super-friendly, service was really slow, and someone in our party said it almost would have made more sense just to walk to the bar ourselves for drinks.\n\nPrices vary depending on times and days, but if you're going to bowl Friday and Saturday nights after 6 p.m., it'll cost a whopping $39.95 per lane per hour. That, to me, is ridiculous when so many other lanes have unlimited cosmic bowling (with good music and music videos) for only $20 a person. Don't go to Lucky Strike-try Scottsdale Lanes instead.	1
"Still old, still warn but they seem to have increased the airflow quite a bit so not as smokie...smoky?? At any rate that is a good change. They have some good shows here. seems to be a little of an older crowd on the floor but looks like they are trying to \""modern\"" up a bit. Auto collection is always a good reason to stop by (free tic at autocollections.com  hash house is still upstairs if you are in the mod for some twisted farm food. Also doing a bunch of work out back (roads are a mess) where they are building a giant skywheel thingie. Hopefully more improvements to come."	1
Although the artwork is amazing and the place looks modern and sleek, the service and care is not so great. \nIf a great look was all that was important in healthcare, they would win hands down but when sick or injured or worse...dying. These are not the things that matter to me. \nWhen your loved one is hooked up to many many different wires, needles, bags, machines, etc. and the alarms are going off, it would be nice to actually have someone act like it matters. \nIts important to know that your loved one is being cared for as if they were the caregivers own family member. \nI actually never met or spoke to a Dr. but I did visit several times and each time the alarms would go off and after waiting several minutes we would have to go get a nurse. Some were well within hearing distance and we were always told they would be there when they were done with whatever else they were doing which was never with another patient. \nSad to say but If I ever need medical care in the future I don't want to be taken there.	1
"One reviewer said it best, \""It's like Black Friday...EVERYDAY!\""\nThis place was a chaotic mess when I was there, but I have a feeling it's always in a state of chaos. That said, it's worth going and having the experience while at the same time finding some good stuff at cheap prices. The shoes and purses where in the worst shape-- holes, pen marks, tears, etc. But the dresses and tops were bountiful to choose from -- lots of designer choices too. I tried on a ton of stuff but only left with a casual dress and tank top. This would be a good place to take in chunks... dresses one day, shoes another."	1
The hunt for a great local pizza continues.  When I hear Chicago style pizza, I think deep dish, ooey-gooey, rich and delicious.  This was the other kind, the thin kind, with a crunchy crust, and cut into squares rather than wedges.  We might have liked the crust if it had some flavor, but truly it had the taste and texture of a matzo cracker.  I don't think it could have been more flavorless if a deliberate effort had been made to make it so.  After the first slice, neither Hon or I ate any of the crust.  Well, Hon tried a few extra bites because he couldn't believe it was so tasteless.  The rest of it, we cracked apart and fed to the birds.\n\nDespite the really awful crust, the pizza toppings had good flavor.  The sauce was tasty and there was just enough of it.  We got a large pizza with sausage, onion, tomato, and black olive.  All toppings were abundant, except the sausage.  Fuzzy was a little stingy with his sausage. Too bad, because it tasted great. The cheese was plentiful and tasted okay, but I have a feeling it wasn't 100% real.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden around the corner from the rest of the Albertson's plaza. We did take out, but there are tables for casual dining in and they offer delivery.  Service was quick and friendly and the menu has plenty of other options, such as Vienna dogs, Italian beef, and wings.  If we ever try Fuzzy's again (unlikely), we'll order anything but the magnificently dismal pizza.  One final note, it's a Pepsi place.  No Coke.\n\nNext!	1
"The fact that their coffee drink \""with cream\"" and their tea with milk are labeled as vegan make me wonder if they really know what vegan means or if their \""vegan\"" dishes also have ghee or some other dairy in them. \n\nMy main complaint is the service. When we asked our server what he recommended as far as vegan food, he replied that he didn't know because he hadn't eaten there in three months....and then he recommended a dish with cottage cheese in it.    In addition, he told us it's BYOB and that we could bring wine because they probably have a corkscrew. He saw one in the kitchen three months ago...uh ok. Later we were asked if we needed anything \""since you're the only two people here.\"" He was definitely trying, so that's something I guess. \n\nThe food was spicy, but pretty good overall. The servings are large (2-3 meals worth, for me).  My vegan dish was served with a yogurt sauce (not vegan). My husband had the fried cauliflower dish and liked it enough but doesn't have any desire to return. \n\nIt might be better to go to the lunch buffet so you can figure out what you like. There are minimal descriptions on the menu and the servers (since the first hadn't eaten there he called over a second server) were unable to answer questions such as \""what does this word mean?\"", \""is this deep fried?\"", \""is this spicy?\"", etc.\n\nWe might give it another chance and try the lunch buffet, since it's so close to our place. Probably not though."	1
"I stopped staying at the Venetian next door when I was given a room last year that was soaking wet even down into the sunken living room (apparently someone let the tub run over). When the hotel merely changed the room and didn't offer any \""makeups\"" (MGM gave me 2 free buffets when something similar happened) I knew it was time to stick to the Palazzo. Well, now it's time to bid adieu to both properties as management has clearly decided that service and cleanliness no longer apply at this property.\n\nWhile the rooms are less worn than at the Venetian (only because it's newer) and they have the electric shades/drapes, there's very little else here that makes it worth spending money for, especially when other properties are fighting for our travel dollars. You are charged a $16 nightly resort fee (incl. tax) that gets you unlimited local and 800 calling (have a cell phone so I don't need it), free internet access (could never get past the sign up page \""accept\"" button) and access to their Fitness Room. This is only access to the gym and NOT the spa facilities which requires an additional $20 upfee but the gym is large and has everything (it just takes forever to walk there from the Palazzo).\n\nThe rooms are spacious and the bed is comfortable but the rooms are not always clean. And the evidence I have to prove that is that during my 2 night stay there recently, housekeeping did not ONCE service my room. Even after making 3 requests and being told that a maid was assigned to my room, I was disappointed to see that when I returned to my room at 10pm that nothing had been done. Discussions with the general manager on site did nothing to rectify the situation, only a weak apology and no effort to compensate, just a promise that I would receive better service the next time (who said there would be a next time). It's obvious that management has cut back on expenses during the recession but cutting back on cleanliness makes me wonder if they're risking more serious consequences (novovirus anyone?) by doing so.\n\nI would NOT recommend this hotel or it's sister property the Venetian to anyone, except my worst enemies (let them get sick, not me!). If you want 5 star service, go next door to the Wynn where they understand that concept (and it's usually cheaper too!). If you want a nice room, stay at the MGM or Mirage for much less money and better service."	1
one word YUM!  i love this place, and the M & M color wall is crazy.\n\nmy only problems\n\n1. The people who work, act like they don't. They have their blinders up, but i can understand why because....\n\n2. The place is a fucking mad house! Crazy tourist looking for the ugliest thing they can get there dirty little hands on!\n\n3. 49 bucks for kids pj's really?\n\nI say stick to the rainbow wall of M&M's in every possible color. There yummy, Don't waste your money on the other crap.	2
Decent burger but underwhelming chili. The chili should be the star of their signature burger, and it was more like an afterthought. The burger was OK, but  I wouldn't rush back. \n\nThere is no easy access to the restaurant from St. Rose, which is a deterrent.  I had to drive through the hospital parking lot to get here. Doh!\nThe yellow peppers were very good, they added a lot of flavor to the burger.	2
"Every now and then I get a hankering for Chinese food for lunch, and order takeout from here. I used to have to call, but now you can order (and pay) through their website.  However, after having order via the website today (with pick up time selected as \""ASAP\""), I will call in the future.\n\nI ordered pork with garlic sauce, white rice and egg drop soup.  Normally when I order takeout (via telephone), it is ready by the time I get there to pick it up (just a few minute walk from my office).  Today, however, I arrived to pick it up. And waited.  After the cashier asked my name/order, I saw him furiously scribble something down on an order pad then walk back to \""check\"" on my order. I don't think they checked their web order, and my order had been sitting there without going back to the kitchen.\n\n25 minutes after the timestamp on my order confirmation email, the food was ready.  \nThat's an enternity for Chinese take-out.\n\nThe food is good, fresh and a nice portion size. But I ordered take out because I didn't want to wait and sit down somewhere"	2
"Smart? Hmmm...maybe. Final? Well, they have a return policy, so not so sure on that. Enjoyable? Pretty much. I'm not a big warehousey shoppy kinda guy. Just like I don't like the HUGE grocery stores and dare I say, frankly, these super monster mega Target stores are little daunting to me. And Costco? Never been? I don't need 48 hot dogs. Nor do I need a gallon of Hidden Valley Ranch. So S & F, has a smaller, more navigatable space. Very organized with prices highly visible. I usually go here for restaurant supplies which are EXPENSIVE. Really...a plastic silverware tray has to cost $32? But they cleaning supplies and paper products are relatively cheap and come in \""semi\"" bulk, so it's not too much. Staff is helpful and knowledgeable, something you don't get at most other stores. And once in a blue moon, they have cool stuff, like hand made wooden bowls marked down from $50 to $12....and it's huge. Sometimes I just sit in it and eat a weenie smothered in ranch dressing! And that's my final answer."	2
I do like the food here. It's very good. They have amazing goblets and I love their onion soup. Their chicken salad is my favorite.  And my husband loves their burgers. \n\nThey do need to improve on customer service\n\nMy kids wanted mac and cheese. The menu said fried mac and cheese. But they like theirs baked. I asked our waitress if we could have it baked instead she said ofcourse! We got our bill and each mac and cheese was $17!!! $17 for a small mac and cheese. She didn't even let us know they would be doubling the price to have it baked. She could have at least let us know when we ordered. \nSo I suggest if your going to change anything on the menu...ask if theirs an additional charge	2
"I have been wanting to try New York Flavor ever since I moved to Surprise. Unfortunately, I was not as impressed as I thought I would be. \n\nThe service is pretty good. Since it was my first time, I asked the woman at the counter if there were any \""favorites\"". She was very helpful in explaining the menu items. \n\nI ended up ordering the Spanish Harlem with a side of potato salad. First, let's talk about the potato salad. It came in a TINY little cup. I am talking, like two bites of potato salad. I wish I had saved the little cup to take a picture. I almost felt like I was being pranked. I paid $1.99 for this potato salad. I expected to be able to eat more than two bites of it. And, to be honest, the two bites of potato salad I had weren't the greatest. It tasted like potato salad you could buy at the grocery store; nothing to write home about.\n\nThe sandwich itself was pretty good. The spread was flavorful and the steak was cooked perfectly. The bread was just okay. The sandwich was $8.99, which felt a little pricey to me based on the size of the sandwich.\n\nAll in all, the service is there, but the food here just isn't something I would expect to receive if I were actually in New York, which is the impression I got from the reviews and the restaurant itself."	2
Eight or nine years ago on a visit to Montreal, I discovered Chu Chai (then in its former location) by accident while wandering the neighborhoods.  I was so thrilled to find an all veg restaurant serving fabulous food I dragged my traveling companion to meals there four or five times on our visit.\n\nLast summer I returned to Montreal -- a little bit older, a little bit wiser, different traveling buddy -- and made a point of heading back to Chu Chai.  \n\nThe restaurant had moved a lot farther up Rue St. Denis and is now more remote.  Boo.  The restaurant is now much smaller and the decor not nearly as subdued or appealing.  Boo.  Looking over the menu, I didn't see the one dish I had obsessed over on my former visit: vegetarian shrimp with crispy basil and sticky rice.  Booooooo.  Oh. Em. Gee.  That shrimp was mouth watering, the basil deep fried into addictive crispy chips and dusted with sugar, and the sweet-ish sticky rice was super sticky and chewy and served in a banana leaf.  No longer on the menu.  Ordered a chicken and mixed veggies, husband ordered spicy beef.  They were good, but they didn't come close to the former quality of the food.  Totally disappointed.  Prices were rather steep, too, even at lunch.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way on my next trip to Montreal to dine at Chu Chai, unfortunately.	2
Like Cheryl C, I passed by this hole in the wall so many times and became increasingly excited about visiting.\n\nWe finally had a chance to stop in for a pint last Friday after a loooong week at work.  We walked in to discover a very bustling place with a reasonably friendly vibe.  We were able to snag a small table to the side where we were able to enjoy our pints and do a bit of people watching.  \n\nI get the impression that this could be a good place to come, especially to enjoy the beer garden on a sunny day, but I think it was a bit more than we were looking for on Friday.  I'm going to sound like a total old person but it was just a bit too loud for what we wanted at the time, and I really do think that I built it up a bit too much in my head to properly enjoy it for what it was.  \n\nI would happily come back here for some sun, but I think it's just not quite my style for an after work pint.	2
Last year I scored one of those cool Groupon deals for three unlimited months of practice at the Bikram Yoga Pittsburgh studio. It was a great deal and I really enjoyed the classes.\n\nFirst off, I think that practicing in a hot room during the cold winter months in Pittsburgh is a great way to spend your time and money. It was refreshing and throughout the season I felt like I had a really nice buffer against my usual cold hands and feet. Bikram might not be for everyone; the room is really hot and it can be overwhelming to some. My husband had a hard time pushing through and doing the movements because it was so hot for him. I on the other hand really liked it, so it might depend on chemistry. It is worth a shot if you are interested through. I will be going in this week to get my winter fix. If you are on the fence about it, check their website and get on the mailing list. BYPGH runs specials regularly and you can usually find a deal to take some classes at a discounted rate, especially if you are new.\n\nI attended classes regularly between December and February and the studio got quite full at times (particularly over the holiday when people return to Pittsburgh to visit family). My work schedule was varying at the time, and I got to try classes on all days and times offered. I'm not sure if it still is, but the studio was carpeted at the time, which to Serena R's point seems strange because there is a lot of sweating going on. I enjoyed the teaching (particularly, I liked Zeb's classes) and even when classes were big the instructors still made point to compliment and constructively correct students, which is the point of attending a class so you can get better.\n\nSome other things that are good to know:\n+DRINK A LOT OF WATER before you even arrive. 90 minutes in a seriously hot room means you are going to sweat. You don't take drink breaks during the class because the point is to focus yourself through a series of 26 positions. Drink a lot before and bring a canteen for after.\n+Bring a yoga mat and a towel big enough to cover the whole mat (or close to it).\n+There's a men's and a women's dressing space with bathrooms, a shower, and cubbies to put your belongings during class.\n+The studio sells some drinks, like water and coconut water.\n+The studio rents mats and towels if you forget yours.\n+Dress: a lot men seems to wear swimming-like trunk shorts, running shorts, or speedo-like briefs. Shirts optional but formfitting usually. Women wear sports bra-like tops, running shorts (spandex or standard), formfitting tank tops, etc. Generally, not much that will hang loose or anything heavy enough to make you feel too hot.\n+Parking: can be tough depending on the time of day (night is easiest for parking). I think they suggest arriving at least 10 minutes early for class but I would leave at least 15 minutes extra for parking and walking to the studio.	2
Very interesting airport. The minute I stepped into the airport from my plane I saw a bunch of slot machines. HAHA! Otherwise everything is okay. It took us a while to find buses to commute.	2
"Being that I'm from Chicago, I do have high expectations for a \""Chicago dog\"".  It is by comparison a good \""Chicago dog\"", however does not seem to have as much flavor as one from Chicago.  I don't know if this is due to the type of hot dogs used (I know at least most if not all the ones I've eaten in Chicago were kosher) or something else.  But they aren't bad.  The breaded mushrooms are good, although they are definitely greasy.  The French fries are also good (especially with the cheese!).  We did a takeout order and everything was wrapped in foil to help stay hot, and it made it back to our office (a couple blocks away) with no problem.  I would visit again, but stand by my current 3-star rating of the food."	2
Went to Postrio for dinner prior to a show.  Had reservations and sat on the patio.  High energy atmosphere in The Venetian's St. Marks Square, with Street Performer type shows going on in the surrounding square.  \n\nShared the Salmon and Seafood Risotto - Salmon was excellent but risotto was a little undercooked.  The server was attentive and professional.  Prices are moderate for Las Vegas.\n\nFrankly, Postrio did not impress.  I expected a little more from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant simply from a food quality standpoint.  While I would suggest it as a viable option if staying at The Venetian. I would not return simply because of the vast number of options in Las Vegas, and would not recommend traveling from a different hotel to check it out.	2
The british invasion in Montreal shows no sign of stopping. Brit & Chips owned by the same group as The Burgundy Lion Pub, has taken over the once coveted Mc Gill Hot Dog, and opened its doors to offer locals a more authentic fish and chips experience. With four staple fish options to combine with chips (british equivalent of french fries) they are well beyond most seafood spots in town.\n\nThe menu also features Tandoori popcorn shrimp, a variety of pasties and other British foods including pork pies, and sausage rolls.\n\nA healthy option for those avoiding the deep fried page on the menu is the Seafood salad, which is a healthy portion at a great price.\n\nWhere the Burgundy Lion has the pub atmosphere dialed in, Brit & Chips has the food perfectly locked in. For lunch or dinner the food is fresh, tasty, and substantial. It's also great for sharing.\n\nDead center of the old port business district, expect it to be busy during the lunch rush.	2
I really like this place. Food has been great & fresh every time I've gone in. Not the fastest service but very friendly. My only slight disappointment is the fresh juice they offer, I've had a few different ones now. Pretty much, they all taste the same, very tart/sour. REALLY hope they improve that! It's nice to have a healthy option near my home now. :)	2
How do I review this location without sounding bias? I absolutely loved the location on Tropicana and Hualapai when I lived in Summerlin. It was so clean...I mean CLEAN! Oh how I loved that location!\n\nTo compare this location with that one would be unfair, because there is ABSOLUTELY no comparison!\n\nThis store just totally misses the mark for me. It has the great prices that you'd expect from a Smitty's, but it's just not clean and inviting. Every time I come here, I just want to get in and get out. My Summerlin location I could stay in for hours and never want to leave! \n\nAt the end of the day, it serves its purpose being so close to home. But if I can, I'll shop the one on Green Valley Parkway and the 215 more often. That one is the closest to my old Summerlin location that I've found in this area.	2
I like Archi's but it's not the best.  It is nice that they opened up a decent Thai Place in Summerlin.  But the selection (veggie), is a bit small and run of the mill.  The atmosphere is nice, the service is good and the food is tasty, but something is just missing.\n\n\nI will go back because it's close to my parents, but I still prefer lotus of Siam.	2
I like Rubio's and this one is fairly close to home - so I go here often. Tonight I decided to have the Grande Bowl with Blackened Mahi (and no rice). Honestly, this was probably the best thing I've ever had at Rubio's! It was just excellent. The staff was efficient too - a great fast-food experience.	3
In all the years I have eaten here, I have never been sick.	3
Great place for Brunch!	3
Was there on Saturday night with some friends. Excellent Go Go Rice, delish sushi. Just wish they had black napkins for those of us who wear black. We looked like lint catchers when we got up to leave.	3
Great food and Chris, our server, was very attentive. It's a little loud inside, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this is darn good food. My only put-off was the price of my wife's skinny margarita which was the price of an entree.	3
Good service, reasonable prices.  I took my truck in for a basic oil change.  I received a call from the owner letting me know about a brake light that was out & asked if I wanted them to replace it.  The clerk was very nice and helpful.  I haven't been here enough to give them 5 stars, but they seem very promising.  I will be going back & avoiding the previous huge chain I used to go to.	3
"My sweetheart was working, so I found myself alone on a Saturday.  Woohoo!  After laying around the townhouse most of the morning, I decided to take a drive to get something to eat and shop at Costco in Tempe.  For a year or so I've wanted to try out Niro's Gyros at the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a stand-alone building that must have been built and then abandoned by Pizza Hut.  No matter, once inside it is clean, with brightly colored tables and chairs. The front counter is gleaming white tile.  \n\nI ordered a double gyro plate, which includes \""two toasted pitas served with a mountain of gyro meat with gyro sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries on the side.\"" After adding a large soda and hand over $12.71, I only had to wait five minutes for my number to be called.  \n\nThis is a casual eating establishment (i.e. plastic forks), so the gyro meat comes packaged within a white styrofoam container wrapped separate in white paper with the hot pitas and fries on the side.  There is enough meat to  overfill both pitas.  I found the whole meal very tasty and enjoyable."	3
In the fast food world of college campus towns, every place should have a traditional place that stands the test of time. That's Papa Del's. Quality pizza & sandwiches with great flavor, huge portions & reasonable prices keep you coming back. Service is slow and the building's architect should have been fired @ the first drawings review, but it's all about the food here & it is good.	3
This was the best place we ate at MGM (though that isn't really saying much...). The make your own salad was great, be creative! Add the good stuff!!\n\nMy boyfriend had the crab soup, it was good, but I preferred the salad. The flatbread was great, and the dips that came with it were awesome.\n\nWe both had the bacon wrapped Sea Bass and it was great! The wait staff was very attentive (the sommelier never let out glasses get close to empty and had good suggestions on what  wine to pair with dinner) and helpful, all offered suggestions when asked and were quiet and polite when we were talking.\n\nWe told our waiter that this was our best dinner in Vegas and the chef showed up shortly thereafter to let us know he had received the compliment and encourage us to visit again the next time we were in town.\n\nYummy food with great service- harder to find in Vegas than I would have thought....	3
It's a fact I give a lot of 4 stars...\nThe food is good and creative, they have good pizza and wonderful specials.\nThe service has always been great and the lunch is really good.  I take out of town guests here, visiting relatives and one time a wayward monk and all have been pleased.  OK I jest about the monk.\nTry it, have a special, enjoy some wine - don't go to a chain restaurant....	3
I've only been in the Stone House during restaurant week. However, I was very impressed. The restaurant has a great homey atmosphere. They give fresh muffins instead of bread, that were even warm when we got them. Plus, our waitress was nice enough to wrap up the ones we didn't eat. My food was delicious and filling. Definitely will be back.	3
"Every time I go to Arcadia Farms, I like to engage in a little fantasy (totally G rated)...\n\n...I'm a lady who lunches, knows nothing about the challenges of the daily workplace grind, and has the time to sip mimosas for 3 hours each afternoon (the mimosa element is really part of a broader alcohol fantasy that I should get checked out)...also, you should know that I'm always wearing a gigantic, Kentucky-derby style hat in this scenario. \n\nWhile the fantasy isn't likely to be my reality anytime soon, I love Arcadia Farms for having created a cozy and charming atmosphere that inspires just this sort of harmless day dreaming. The restaurant itself if small, which adds to the French country/shabby chic feel. The patio is beautiful and has a quaint garden feel. When you're there you'll immediately notice that the \""ladies who lunch\"" fantasy is actually a reality for many of the patrons.\n\nThe food is lovely, which is exactly how food should be at this type of place. One of my favorites is the pesto shrimp salad, and the warm vegetable salad is a close second. If you're in the mood to splurge, order one of the mini cakes - you'll be glad you did. Arcadia Farms is as famous for fabulous pastries as it is for salads, sandwiches and tea. \n\nWhen you're next at the Phoenix Art Museum, keep in mind that Arcadia Farms has another location there, though it is somewhat different. Similarly delish menu, but the atmosphere is much more streamlined and modern to fit the feel of the museum. While I love the original location the most, the museum location is a great treat when you're downtown."	3
So I've finally gotten the chance to see what Earl is all about on my most recent Vegas trip and I must say it is pretty good!\n\nThey have a pretty big menu, ranging from sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and even desserts! The prices are pretty good too! About $6 for a hot sandwich!\n\nAll of the sandwiches looked and sounded really delicious - well, being hungover and starving, anything sounds good to be honest. Nonetheless, I was torn between The Earl's Club - roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged Swiss cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and sandwich sauce - and The Full Montagu - freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and their savory mustard sauce. My friends, who have been here in the past, told me that I should just get both, eat half of each sandwich and save it for the ride back, so I ended up with both. My friend alone, bought 4 different sandwiches for herself, so I didn't feel that bad for buying two.\n\nNo lie, The Full Montagu was amazingggggggg. So fresh! It was the best thing to cure my hangover. Even so, I couldn't even finish the quarter of it. I didn't eat The Earl's Club until the next day, even so, it STILL tasted pretty good. \n\nThe only downside is that this place seems to always be crowded. We waited about 20 minutes before we could order. Twenty minutes doesn't seem long, but when you're starving, it seems like foreverrrrrr. I wouldn't want to wait in this line at 4 in the morning after ending my night at the clubs. \n\nAnyways, I'm definitely glad they're opening a location in Downtown Disney. I get to try out more of the sandwiches without having to be in Vegas!	3
Very gourmet sandwhiches. You have to go here to see what the sandwhich of the day is. Excpect to pay about 10$+ for a sandwhich, but it will be good and different from what your normally used to. All fresh ingrediants are used and change from day to day. Its all outdoor seating or take it to go. Dont be surprised if there is a line out of the door. It gets a little crazy at lunch time so go early!	3
The food is delish!! Great menu and wine list :)	3
Loved the ambiance of this place. Very chill, trendy, and homey. Everything feels so familiar..in a: I feel like Im at home drinking and listening to music with friends kind of way. Possibly because it is a bar inside of a house? Will definitely go back!	3
This Wendy's is the best one in the area. Normally I don't eat at Wendy's but this place is right next to my work and is so convenient. But there are plenty of food places bear here so if it wasn't good, I really don't HAVE to go there. I go because the food is always great, their salads are fresh the chicken is cooked perfectly. The workers are wonderful. Tammy is amazing and helpful. I definitely recommend this Wendy's if you're looking for something quick and yummy.	4
I really liked the poppy seed and all dressed-up bagels.  They are fresh out of the oven with a crunchy shell and soft, light interior.; they are also very slightly sweet.  Try either one with the cream cheese, which is also fluffy and light.  I really wish that we have one of these back home.  Spread bagelry just doesn't come close.  This is the real deal when it comes to Montreal bagels.  St. Viateur is good, too, but I like the everything bagel here.	4
I love love love Iron Chef! The place itself is small but spacious and decorated very nicely. The staff are all very polite and attentive. The quality of the food is amazing and the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap. It's a great atmosphere and I consider this my favorite sushi joint in town :)	4
This boutique has something for everyone!  The clothing selection is always new and fresh, Cara and Beth are so friendly and helpful!	4
Had a craving for some authentic Chinese food while visiting.  Food Express Chinese is an unexpected gem not too far of a drive from the Vegas strip.  Great classics dishes and some with a twist.  Their staff is friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.	4
"Scottsdale Fine Jewelers helped my fiance make me the happiest girl in all the world! Scott picked out (all on his own) and purchased my engagement setting from here and since the blissful day that he got down on one knee and asked me to be his wife, I have since made Scottsdale Fine Jewelers my go-to jewelery shop! We are in the process of purchasing our wedding bands from here too. \n\nI absolutely love the locally-owned feel of this jeweler. Typically it takes at least a week or more to get a ring re-sized, but here they can do it within hours! This means I don't have to part with my dear ring! The owner, his wife and their staff are incredibly friendly and very helpful with everything. I am searching for earrings to wear with my wedding dress and they have a great selection. If I'm lucky, my wallet might permit me to purchase a pair from here! Speaking of pricing, they have some extremely reasonably priced jeweler as well as very high-end jewelery. No matter the budget, chances are they have something. During my visits, I browsed the display cases and noticed a nice selection of engagement rings, bands and regular jewelery. They also can make anything you need because they have an in-house jeweler! I am so happy my fiance chose Scottsdale Fine Jewelers to purchase my ring because now they have a new customer in me too! I also thank them for treating an engagement ring like \""an emergency situation\"" because they sized my engagement ring and got the diamond placed in the setting within a couple days and just in time for the weekend so that my fiance could propose!\n\nAfter the proposal, I got to know Scottsdale Fine Jewelers very well! We both first stopped in to say thank you and to get my ring sized (I gave my fiance the wrong ring size!) They were very nice and friendly with everything! \n\nWe knew right away that we wanted to use them for our wedding bands, so in January, we stopped by to begin the search. My fiance's band was easy to find because he just wanted a classic platinum band. However, mine was not so easy! My ring is very unique and because of that, the band had to be made to match the ring. The jewelers said that he could get it made through the designer out of NYC who made my engagement ring, but they also offered to create it in-house with their jeweler to cut the cost. We decided to go in-house and wow, their in-house jeweler is certainly talented! I visited Scottsdale Fine Jewelers several times over the next four months and each time it was so enjoyable to stop in and talk to everyone there. I never did get to meet the talented jewelery maker, but her works says it all. The ring matched perfectly to my engagement ring and it looks beautiful! They worked with my schedule and got it to me in time. \n\nWe loved this jewelery shop so much that my parents ended up surprising me with a pair of earrings to wear on the wedding day and bought my sister the matching ring to wear as my Maid of Honor! Needless to say, Scottsdale Fine Jewelers is now our go-to jeweler and I thank them for making the wedding ring experience so delightful!"	4
"After moving to downtown Phoenix (and loving having done so) I grew tired of traveling 45 minutes each way to visit my stylist of 10+ years. A stylist I loved and admired. The decision to find a new stylist was traumatic, to say the least. After all, NOTHING is more important than good hair. It does not matter how much your shoes, clothes and car cost if your hair \""ain't right\"". \n\nAfter coming to terms with the decision to search for a new stylist/salon (thank you yoga, meditation and herbal cleansers) I decided to give Trini Salon a try. The salon is just around the corner from my home and a short walk or a quick  two minute drive when I'm in the mood to pollute the world. \n\nI was able to get an appointment with Trini himself (the man is busy!) relatively easy. When I arrived I was greeted by friendly and may I add, very attractive staff.  Once I met Trini I decided to let go of my inhibitions and simply asked for Trini's ideas on which direction my hair should take. Trini was straight forward and made suggestions about my hair I'd not tried before.  His choice of words and explanation made me think \""this man knows what he's doing\"" so I said \""go for it\"" and he did. It was like a scene from Edward Scissorhands. He moved fast, with authority and no hesitation. A master at work. And the result?  Perfection!  I've been back every three weeks since that first time and I'll continue to go until he retires or I lose my hair. And now that my \""do\"" is oh so right, I can spend a little less on shoes because I'm pretty sure no one is looking down at them anyway. \n\nI highly recommend this salon and from what I've learned, he's trained and is training every stylist to deliver the same level of service and precision. A win win scenario if you ask me...did you ask me?"	4
Great bar. Not too many people on Sunday or Monday night for football. Yummy food. (Their boneless wings and BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger are to die for!) The bartender was really friendly and made fantastic drinks.	4
"Let me first say that I am not a burger eating kind of gal. I will be honest about having my doubts about paying for a $14 (on average) for a \""gourmet\"" burger. This place blew this thought out of the water fairly quickly. \n\nMy group and I decided to share 2 burgers and fries. What we learned was that we should have just either gotten the 2 burgers to share or 3 burgers instead. But honestly, we were pretty filled with the hell's kitchen (beef: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato) & southern yardbird (chicken: sharp cheddar, mustard BBQ sauce, pickle, butter lettuce) burgers and sweet potato fries. \n\nOur group had one guy so don't think it was only 3 girls with itty bitty appetites. We were all pretty filled and content after leaving this place to explore Planet Hollywood some more. The portion size was on the larger side as the meat patty was anything but small. The service was GREAT as our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful (I asked for recommendations for a cell phone repair place and our server asked around and came back with a place).\n\nI would absolutely recommend this place if you're wanting the most juicy and tender burgers--like ever. :) If you're visiting the casinos in the area, this place is a great place to eat--and in walking distance of the casinos as well. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is very popular so be patience if there is a slight line."	4
I used to hate going to the dentist but now that I have been here twice I wish I would have found Dr. Nelson earlier! There is no waiting, everyone is friendly, and very fast. Caitlyn my hygienist was awesome. Also Rhonda at the front desk is extremely helpful with billing insurance. I have never actually had anyone sit down and explain every single aspect of the billing before! The office is super clean and they even offer nice headphones you can put on while working on your teeth.	4
A classic steakhouse.  Stop by around 7:30 for a well prepared cut of meat.  Swing back around midnight for drink from their more than adequate bar and grab a quick snack from the late night menu.	4
I used to live behind here for all of middle school and high school and this is the place to eat! Whether it's by the Alice of a whole pie, it's the best by far. My mom loves their Greek salad and hot subs. My boyfriend loves their wings and baked ziti. Amin is always friendly and remembers return customers by name! Once we came right as they were closing and he came out and said he'd make our pizza anyways, which was a happy surprise and be greatly appreciate the great service. \nTheir pizza has a nice crisp crust, the right amount of sauce and cheese. You can taste its homemade and it's done right! Even the leftovers the next day are almost even better. Even cold!\n\nI've since moved further into Scottsdale but still find myself here for pizza. It's like home!	4
Highly recommended hotel!  \n\nMy second time in Vegas.  The First time I stayed at Paris.  This trip out I stayed 8 days at MGM Grand and then 1 day at The Golden Nugget.  I wanted to see downtown LV.  I have to say this was the best day of the whole trip.  The service here was unbeatable, esp. compared to every place on The Strip.  The employees actually like their jobs, they care about you and they go out of their way to show you just this,\n\nMy favorite part was the AMAZING OUTDOOR POOL!  Three Pool areas, a jacuzzi, private cabanas, cushioned clean and covered chaise chairs.  The 3 story high water slide goes right through the HUGE shark tank!  Very kid friendly too.  Private adult pool for those looking for more quiet atmosphere.  The room was 100 plus tax.  Can't beat this price anywhere in Vegas.  The room didn't have a coffee pot, a fridge or a microwave (BUT NO HOTEL IN VEGAS DOES!!!) The room was newly updated- nice bed, huge flat screen tv, great view, cozy.  \n\nThe buffet was better than the MGM buffet by FAR!  When checking in, we received 2 Buy one, get one Buffets.  The price is already half that of the Strip Buffets.  I felt you got a lot for the price.  \n\nGnotto, restaurant, VERY GOOD!  The Wedding Cake is a must have!\n\nI honestly cannot say a single bad thing about this hotel.  After my experience all week at the MGM and multiple places along the Strip, I was ready to leave and never come back to LV.  This hotel has changed my perspective and I will def. be staying here again if  and when I come back to Sin City.  \n\nThe bus stop is right outside the hotel and makes for easy access anywhere on the Strip.  \n\nAnother nice thing about this hotel is that you dont have to walk 20 minutes to the pool, or to the lobby, or to the food areas.  Everything is pretty close.	4
This is my favorite nail place in Charlotte. \n\nEveryone was so friendly and made me feel so comfortable and everything felt so super clean. I especially liked that the lady made sure to tell me the price before I picked colors or anything- just since it was my first time there. \n\nI am 7.5 months pregnant and these ladies made me feel like a queen. I especially loved chatting with the lady (wish I knew her name) who has a 7 month old baby at home and getting all kinds of tips about the hospital and whatnot that no one ever seems to think to tell a new mom. \n\nI love that the basic service here included a parafin dip and that they will do both your nails and toes at the same time, so you can just sit back and truly feel pampered. \n\nIt has been almost a week since I have been and my feet are still feeling super soft and even the hubs commented on how much better they were after this place than any other one that I have been to recently. \n\nI am hoping to see these ladies at least one more time before this little baby girl gets here to make sure that my nails are in tip top shape for her arrival.	4
How is it I've never heard of this place and it's right behind where I live!?\n\nThis place is amazing. First of all, they HAND WASH your car and they do it INSIDE. I'm literally sitting in a beautifully air conditioned waiting room while I watch them meticulously detail my truck.\n\nDo not go anywhere else. Nick and his crew will take great care of you and your vehicle. I'd give them 10 stars if I could.	4
I love this place! The best dim sum in Chandler. My service was exceptional, I even went on lunchtime on a Friday with my boyfriend. It was priced fairly good, we both gorged ourselves on less than $30.00. Not too sure about the pink tablecloths or the giant lobster tank, but overall it was delicious :)	4

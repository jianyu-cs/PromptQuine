Terrible food for dinner. Sorry, but if you are looking for a decent meal, don't give this place a try. Yes, there is an outdoor section right in the middle of the Venetian shops and it looks really cute--no, don't let that mislead you, don't eat here. And I'm not someone who expects much...\nWe ordered a lasagna and chicken parmigiana. Pretty basic Italian dishes you can't mess up right? Wrong. My lasagna was very lacking, all it had was meat and sauce.. and the meat was very questionable. I was wincing  with every bite, just because I was starving. The chicken parmigiana was not too bad, but the spaghetti was very bland; my friend said the sauce tasted watered down and bland. The bread that came before our entrees came in a basket and wrapped with dinner napkins... very blah bread, and they couldn't even bother to toast it? \n\nI didn't check out the bakery items, but just for their dinner entrees, I will never eat here for meals again. Dislike Tintoretto.	0
After Dana George from Hilton left me the Yelp comment on this review AND emailed me with the note below on May 16th, about a month later I've still not received the points. If this is how they treat their Diamond tiered guests I can't imagine how they treat everyone else...ridiculous.\n\nDear Mr. Ng,\n \nI received a correspondence from our Hilton Customer Service Center in regards to a copy of your receipt and the credit of your Hilton Hhonors points for your stay from 4/29/12 to 5/4/12.  I have emailed you a copy of your hotel receipt on a separate email and I have personally gone in and submitted your points.  You should be able to view this credit to your Hhonors account by tomorrow morning.  I truly apologize for the confusion and added work this has caused you.\n \nRegards,\n\nDana George\nAssistant General Manager\nCustomer Service	0
If getting your nails done in a clean environment is important to you, I would suggest steering clear of this place. I went in for a manicure one morning and another lady was waiting for one right after me. The glass bowl filled with water used to soak my nails in was simply dumped out and refilled with water for the next person. I was totally disgusted! There are no sanitizing solutions in sight. The nail utensils used are kept in plastic boxes and not cleaned after each use. I watched the lady wipe my dead skin off and then put them right back in the box. I was totally grossed out. Also, she asked me if I would pay for my manicure before we started, which I thought was a little weird, but not too big of a deal I suppose. And on top of that, it started chipping the next day because she was rushed to get to the next customer and missed the sides of my nails with the second coat. Delightful nails across the street is much better!	0
I have always enjoyed the food at Mimi's Cafe, but this Mimi's in particular is so dirty. It seems like they never clean the decorations on the wall. I happened to touch the back of a booth one time and my hand had gross, greasy accumulated dust/dirt. I let the waitress know and she said they only clean what the manager says to clean. This place could use a good deep scrubbing from top to bottom.	0
Walked in first before two other couples came in the door. Apparently they were regulars because when the hostess arrived she knew them by name and greeted them. After telling her we came in first she ignored us anyway and sat the regulars. After we finally got sat we never saw a single soul. She sat us, went back over to the regulars to chat, then dissapeared. We watched as everyone else got their order taken. We were ignored and waited about 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. I'll never go back again because of that. Sorry Nee House. We wanted to like you!	0
Never would I recommend this place to anyone. Got here early on a Sunday morning and was seated right away. Service was better than ok. Food was just blah. Worst experience was while eating, there was a roach crawling on the wall behind us.  Told the server and she smiled at us, then she grabbed a rag and proceed to kill the roach w it...question is will that rag be used to clean your table?	0
"Finally someone wrote back to me. Claims I don't know how to view the DVD \""After some collaboration we've discovered it is possible you are attempting to view the slide show in a DVD player rather than a computer.\"" I build websites. I know how to open files on a DVD. The disc wasn't burnt correctly. Also, they have not responded back about sending me the 5X7 as promised. And what about the 19% service fee I was charged for the tip I left. Is that legal? Seems extremely odd...\n\nIf you're looking for a place to get hitched avoid Vegas Weddings at all cost."	0
OK so I have been trying to stick to this whole New Years resolution thing which is not easy. But decided to give this place a shot since they offer a few healthy options. Big mistake!!! OK so first off the service was good, and the place was clean except for the area in front of the soda machine. It really needed to be wiped down big time.\n\nI guess my biggest gripe had to be with the food. It was nasty!! Flavorless beans, dry chicken that was closer to jerky and a tortilla that seemed to change colors at the bottom. Not sure why but did not remember paying for a color changing burrito. \n\nNow I understand that this is just a take out place that is very similar to say a taco bell or Del taco, but the food is bad at these places as well. I have to say while the food is bad the service and free refills of horchata did make me at least feel they deserved the one star I gave them, but wish I could have gotten a refund. Sorry but the only person crazy here is me for thinking this place was going to be good.\n\nNever again	0
"I stopped staying at the Venetian next door when I was given a room last year that was soaking wet even down into the sunken living room (apparently someone let the tub run over). When the hotel merely changed the room and didn't offer any \""makeups\"" (MGM gave me 2 free buffets when something similar happened) I knew it was time to stick to the Palazzo. Well, now it's time to bid adieu to both properties as management has clearly decided that service and cleanliness no longer apply at this property.\n\nWhile the rooms are less worn than at the Venetian (only because it's newer) and they have the electric shades/drapes, there's very little else here that makes it worth spending money for, especially when other properties are fighting for our travel dollars. You are charged a $16 nightly resort fee (incl. tax) that gets you unlimited local and 800 calling (have a cell phone so I don't need it), free internet access (could never get past the sign up page \""accept\"" button) and access to their Fitness Room. This is only access to the gym and NOT the spa facilities which requires an additional $20 upfee but the gym is large and has everything (it just takes forever to walk there from the Palazzo).\n\nThe rooms are spacious and the bed is comfortable but the rooms are not always clean. And the evidence I have to prove that is that during my 2 night stay there recently, housekeeping did not ONCE service my room. Even after making 3 requests and being told that a maid was assigned to my room, I was disappointed to see that when I returned to my room at 10pm that nothing had been done. Discussions with the general manager on site did nothing to rectify the situation, only a weak apology and no effort to compensate, just a promise that I would receive better service the next time (who said there would be a next time). It's obvious that management has cut back on expenses during the recession but cutting back on cleanliness makes me wonder if they're risking more serious consequences (novovirus anyone?) by doing so.\n\nI would NOT recommend this hotel or it's sister property the Venetian to anyone, except my worst enemies (let them get sick, not me!). If you want 5 star service, go next door to the Wynn where they understand that concept (and it's usually cheaper too!). If you want a nice room, stay at the MGM or Mirage for much less money and better service."	1
This sephora is not worth your time. Not only do they not carry all products, the ones they do carry are often out of stock or have broken boxes/seals.  The sales staff also is horrible. They are not helpful and uneducated.  I have gone to this sephora a few times because it's close to my house but every time I've been disappointed. This most recent visit I was the only person in the store and there were two sales girls.  Nether said hello or asked if I needed help. One had her head down the whole time at the counter the other was doing her entire makeup with the samples.	1
"We brought some out of town guests for lunch on New Years day.  When our waitress came to our table my husband started to ask if they had a nutrition guide for their kids menu.  Before he could finish she curtly said \""No\"". He politely finished his sentence, explaining that our 7 year was diabetic and we needed the information to calculate her insulin.  She then said, just as rudely \""still no, do you want to place your drink orders?\"" We did stay, but only because we brought people and we felt bad.  The service did not improve and it took a very long time to receive our food even though the restaurant was not busy.  I'm sorry, I don't care how good your food is.  It does not make up for poor customer service."	1
Although the artwork is amazing and the place looks modern and sleek, the service and care is not so great. \nIf a great look was all that was important in healthcare, they would win hands down but when sick or injured or worse...dying. These are not the things that matter to me. \nWhen your loved one is hooked up to many many different wires, needles, bags, machines, etc. and the alarms are going off, it would be nice to actually have someone act like it matters. \nIts important to know that your loved one is being cared for as if they were the caregivers own family member. \nI actually never met or spoke to a Dr. but I did visit several times and each time the alarms would go off and after waiting several minutes we would have to go get a nurse. Some were well within hearing distance and we were always told they would be there when they were done with whatever else they were doing which was never with another patient. \nSad to say but If I ever need medical care in the future I don't want to be taken there.	1
Looks:  Stripmall bar with a small outdoor patio.  Inside was dark with cheap furniture... your standard dive bar.\n\nCrowd:  Must have been senior citizen night.  The place wreaked of despair.  Granted, it was Monday at 6pm.  I've heard the place gets a decent crowd on other nights.\n\nFood:  We got 2 burgers and a chicken sandwich and they were all fairly awful.  The burgers were slightly overcooked, on big wonderbread buns fresh from the bag.  No lettuce or tomato.  The fries and tater tots were decent, though clearly not homemade.\n\nValue:  Beers were very cheap during happy hour.  The food prices were about what you'd expect from a bar... maybe slightly higher.  The burgers were on special for $7.\n\nService:  Good.\n\nMiscellaneous:  Beers were available in mini-pitchers, which I think is a nice touch.  The patio is dog friendly.\n\nVerdict:  I'll never eat there again.  That's for sure.  It's an OK place to grab a beer, but there are lots of other (better) food & drink choices around this place.	1
"We went a few weeks ago. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar. \n\nThe Banh Mi I ordered was pretty bland, and the burger is overpriced. I had to order the banh mi like 3 times and point to it on the menu because the server said he didn't know what it was. Once he read the decription, he said \""oh yeah - that's new but its my favorite thing on the menu.\"" Wait, what?\n\nWe ordered a beer flight, and they don't have any of those cool trays that hold the glasses, or even printed placemats that describe each beer, yet. Maybe if they ever firm up the beer selection they will. The flight wasn't bad - but it had a couple of guest brews in substituting for their brews that they were out of.\n\nSince this is the closest brewpub to our house, I had growlers with me. I didn't even walk out to the car to get one. I was hoping for a nice rich porter to fill them with - and they didn't have any that day.\n\nTheir saving grace was the Abita Purple Haze on tap. I like Abita beers, but out of all the beers in the flight we tried...I went with the Abita. That's not how it should work at a brewery, unless your guest beer is something like a Pliny or a Stone rarity."	1
Went here tonight... First time in years going to a haunted house that wasn't in an amusement park.  Must say that I get a lot  more scared from the cart riding haunted houses found in amusement parks.\n\nIt just wasn't at all scary. I didn't even find a moment when I was scared or even caught off guard.  . & I did have an open mind and was pretty excited about it.\n\nOnly reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they actually did a great job with their artistry.  It was more of an art/movie scene museum. A place where you can come and get an up close look at movie stages and the magnificent make-up. \n\nSo save your money if you are looking to get scared. Come to this place if you want a look at movie make-up and technology.\n\nOh and make sure you pay the extra 11 or so bucks for VIP 1 over general admission. It's well worth not waiting in an obnoxiously long G.A. line. NO ONE was in VIP 2, that's just a waste of money. I would've been REaLLY upset if I had waited in the G.A. Line only to be so disappointed by the weak haunted house.\n\nBottom line - save ur $$$	1
The hunt for a great local pizza continues.  When I hear Chicago style pizza, I think deep dish, ooey-gooey, rich and delicious.  This was the other kind, the thin kind, with a crunchy crust, and cut into squares rather than wedges.  We might have liked the crust if it had some flavor, but truly it had the taste and texture of a matzo cracker.  I don't think it could have been more flavorless if a deliberate effort had been made to make it so.  After the first slice, neither Hon or I ate any of the crust.  Well, Hon tried a few extra bites because he couldn't believe it was so tasteless.  The rest of it, we cracked apart and fed to the birds.\n\nDespite the really awful crust, the pizza toppings had good flavor.  The sauce was tasty and there was just enough of it.  We got a large pizza with sausage, onion, tomato, and black olive.  All toppings were abundant, except the sausage.  Fuzzy was a little stingy with his sausage. Too bad, because it tasted great. The cheese was plentiful and tasted okay, but I have a feeling it wasn't 100% real.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden around the corner from the rest of the Albertson's plaza. We did take out, but there are tables for casual dining in and they offer delivery.  Service was quick and friendly and the menu has plenty of other options, such as Vienna dogs, Italian beef, and wings.  If we ever try Fuzzy's again (unlikely), we'll order anything but the magnificently dismal pizza.  One final note, it's a Pepsi place.  No Coke.\n\nNext!	1
I like Archi's but it's not the best.  It is nice that they opened up a decent Thai Place in Summerlin.  But the selection (veggie), is a bit small and run of the mill.  The atmosphere is nice, the service is good and the food is tasty, but something is just missing.\n\n\nI will go back because it's close to my parents, but I still prefer lotus of Siam.	2
I do like the food here. It's very good. They have amazing goblets and I love their onion soup. Their chicken salad is my favorite.  And my husband loves their burgers. \n\nThey do need to improve on customer service\n\nMy kids wanted mac and cheese. The menu said fried mac and cheese. But they like theirs baked. I asked our waitress if we could have it baked instead she said ofcourse! We got our bill and each mac and cheese was $17!!! $17 for a small mac and cheese. She didn't even let us know they would be doubling the price to have it baked. She could have at least let us know when we ordered. \nSo I suggest if your going to change anything on the menu...ask if theirs an additional charge	2
Like Cheryl C, I passed by this hole in the wall so many times and became increasingly excited about visiting.\n\nWe finally had a chance to stop in for a pint last Friday after a loooong week at work.  We walked in to discover a very bustling place with a reasonably friendly vibe.  We were able to snag a small table to the side where we were able to enjoy our pints and do a bit of people watching.  \n\nI get the impression that this could be a good place to come, especially to enjoy the beer garden on a sunny day, but I think it was a bit more than we were looking for on Friday.  I'm going to sound like a total old person but it was just a bit too loud for what we wanted at the time, and I really do think that I built it up a bit too much in my head to properly enjoy it for what it was.  \n\nI would happily come back here for some sun, but I think it's just not quite my style for an after work pint.	2
Went to Postrio for dinner prior to a show.  Had reservations and sat on the patio.  High energy atmosphere in The Venetian's St. Marks Square, with Street Performer type shows going on in the surrounding square.  \n\nShared the Salmon and Seafood Risotto - Salmon was excellent but risotto was a little undercooked.  The server was attentive and professional.  Prices are moderate for Las Vegas.\n\nFrankly, Postrio did not impress.  I expected a little more from a Wolfgang Puck restaurant simply from a food quality standpoint.  While I would suggest it as a viable option if staying at The Venetian. I would not return simply because of the vast number of options in Las Vegas, and would not recommend traveling from a different hotel to check it out.	2
one word YUM!  i love this place, and the M & M color wall is crazy.\n\nmy only problems\n\n1. The people who work, act like they don't. They have their blinders up, but i can understand why because....\n\n2. The place is a fucking mad house! Crazy tourist looking for the ugliest thing they can get there dirty little hands on!\n\n3. 49 bucks for kids pj's really?\n\nI say stick to the rainbow wall of M&M's in every possible color. There yummy, Don't waste your money on the other crap.	2
Very interesting airport. The minute I stepped into the airport from my plane I saw a bunch of slot machines. HAHA! Otherwise everything is okay. It took us a while to find buses to commute.	2
"Smart? Hmmm...maybe. Final? Well, they have a return policy, so not so sure on that. Enjoyable? Pretty much. I'm not a big warehousey shoppy kinda guy. Just like I don't like the HUGE grocery stores and dare I say, frankly, these super monster mega Target stores are little daunting to me. And Costco? Never been? I don't need 48 hot dogs. Nor do I need a gallon of Hidden Valley Ranch. So S & F, has a smaller, more navigatable space. Very organized with prices highly visible. I usually go here for restaurant supplies which are EXPENSIVE. Really...a plastic silverware tray has to cost $32? But they cleaning supplies and paper products are relatively cheap and come in \""semi\"" bulk, so it's not too much. Staff is helpful and knowledgeable, something you don't get at most other stores. And once in a blue moon, they have cool stuff, like hand made wooden bowls marked down from $50 to $12....and it's huge. Sometimes I just sit in it and eat a weenie smothered in ranch dressing! And that's my final answer."	2
The british invasion in Montreal shows no sign of stopping. Brit & Chips owned by the same group as The Burgundy Lion Pub, has taken over the once coveted Mc Gill Hot Dog, and opened its doors to offer locals a more authentic fish and chips experience. With four staple fish options to combine with chips (british equivalent of french fries) they are well beyond most seafood spots in town.\n\nThe menu also features Tandoori popcorn shrimp, a variety of pasties and other British foods including pork pies, and sausage rolls.\n\nA healthy option for those avoiding the deep fried page on the menu is the Seafood salad, which is a healthy portion at a great price.\n\nWhere the Burgundy Lion has the pub atmosphere dialed in, Brit & Chips has the food perfectly locked in. For lunch or dinner the food is fresh, tasty, and substantial. It's also great for sharing.\n\nDead center of the old port business district, expect it to be busy during the lunch rush.	2
Very gourmet sandwhiches. You have to go here to see what the sandwhich of the day is. Excpect to pay about 10$+ for a sandwhich, but it will be good and different from what your normally used to. All fresh ingrediants are used and change from day to day. Its all outdoor seating or take it to go. Dont be surprised if there is a line out of the door. It gets a little crazy at lunch time so go early!	3
In all the years I have eaten here, I have never been sick.	3
Loved the ambiance of this place. Very chill, trendy, and homey. Everything feels so familiar..in a: I feel like Im at home drinking and listening to music with friends kind of way. Possibly because it is a bar inside of a house? Will definitely go back!	3
Great food and Chris, our server, was very attentive. It's a little loud inside, but it doesn't take away from the fact that this is darn good food. My only put-off was the price of my wife's skinny margarita which was the price of an entree.	3
So I've finally gotten the chance to see what Earl is all about on my most recent Vegas trip and I must say it is pretty good!\n\nThey have a pretty big menu, ranging from sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, and even desserts! The prices are pretty good too! About $6 for a hot sandwich!\n\nAll of the sandwiches looked and sounded really delicious - well, being hungover and starving, anything sounds good to be honest. Nonetheless, I was torn between The Earl's Club - roasted turkey, smoked bacon, aged Swiss cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and sandwich sauce - and The Full Montagu - freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged Swiss and sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and their savory mustard sauce. My friends, who have been here in the past, told me that I should just get both, eat half of each sandwich and save it for the ride back, so I ended up with both. My friend alone, bought 4 different sandwiches for herself, so I didn't feel that bad for buying two.\n\nNo lie, The Full Montagu was amazingggggggg. So fresh! It was the best thing to cure my hangover. Even so, I couldn't even finish the quarter of it. I didn't eat The Earl's Club until the next day, even so, it STILL tasted pretty good. \n\nThe only downside is that this place seems to always be crowded. We waited about 20 minutes before we could order. Twenty minutes doesn't seem long, but when you're starving, it seems like foreverrrrrr. I wouldn't want to wait in this line at 4 in the morning after ending my night at the clubs. \n\nAnyways, I'm definitely glad they're opening a location in Downtown Disney. I get to try out more of the sandwiches without having to be in Vegas!	3
This was the best place we ate at MGM (though that isn't really saying much...). The make your own salad was great, be creative! Add the good stuff!!\n\nMy boyfriend had the crab soup, it was good, but I preferred the salad. The flatbread was great, and the dips that came with it were awesome.\n\nWe both had the bacon wrapped Sea Bass and it was great! The wait staff was very attentive (the sommelier never let out glasses get close to empty and had good suggestions on what  wine to pair with dinner) and helpful, all offered suggestions when asked and were quiet and polite when we were talking.\n\nWe told our waiter that this was our best dinner in Vegas and the chef showed up shortly thereafter to let us know he had received the compliment and encourage us to visit again the next time we were in town.\n\nYummy food with great service- harder to find in Vegas than I would have thought....	3
The food is delish!! Great menu and wine list :)	3
Good service, reasonable prices.  I took my truck in for a basic oil change.  I received a call from the owner letting me know about a brake light that was out & asked if I wanted them to replace it.  The clerk was very nice and helpful.  I haven't been here enough to give them 5 stars, but they seem very promising.  I will be going back & avoiding the previous huge chain I used to go to.	3
A classic steakhouse.  Stop by around 7:30 for a well prepared cut of meat.  Swing back around midnight for drink from their more than adequate bar and grab a quick snack from the late night menu.	4
I used to live behind here for all of middle school and high school and this is the place to eat! Whether it's by the Alice of a whole pie, it's the best by far. My mom loves their Greek salad and hot subs. My boyfriend loves their wings and baked ziti. Amin is always friendly and remembers return customers by name! Once we came right as they were closing and he came out and said he'd make our pizza anyways, which was a happy surprise and be greatly appreciate the great service. \nTheir pizza has a nice crisp crust, the right amount of sauce and cheese. You can taste its homemade and it's done right! Even the leftovers the next day are almost even better. Even cold!\n\nI've since moved further into Scottsdale but still find myself here for pizza. It's like home!	4
I really liked the poppy seed and all dressed-up bagels.  They are fresh out of the oven with a crunchy shell and soft, light interior.; they are also very slightly sweet.  Try either one with the cream cheese, which is also fluffy and light.  I really wish that we have one of these back home.  Spread bagelry just doesn't come close.  This is the real deal when it comes to Montreal bagels.  St. Viateur is good, too, but I like the everything bagel here.	4
Highly recommended hotel!  \n\nMy second time in Vegas.  The First time I stayed at Paris.  This trip out I stayed 8 days at MGM Grand and then 1 day at The Golden Nugget.  I wanted to see downtown LV.  I have to say this was the best day of the whole trip.  The service here was unbeatable, esp. compared to every place on The Strip.  The employees actually like their jobs, they care about you and they go out of their way to show you just this,\n\nMy favorite part was the AMAZING OUTDOOR POOL!  Three Pool areas, a jacuzzi, private cabanas, cushioned clean and covered chaise chairs.  The 3 story high water slide goes right through the HUGE shark tank!  Very kid friendly too.  Private adult pool for those looking for more quiet atmosphere.  The room was 100 plus tax.  Can't beat this price anywhere in Vegas.  The room didn't have a coffee pot, a fridge or a microwave (BUT NO HOTEL IN VEGAS DOES!!!) The room was newly updated- nice bed, huge flat screen tv, great view, cozy.  \n\nThe buffet was better than the MGM buffet by FAR!  When checking in, we received 2 Buy one, get one Buffets.  The price is already half that of the Strip Buffets.  I felt you got a lot for the price.  \n\nGnotto, restaurant, VERY GOOD!  The Wedding Cake is a must have!\n\nI honestly cannot say a single bad thing about this hotel.  After my experience all week at the MGM and multiple places along the Strip, I was ready to leave and never come back to LV.  This hotel has changed my perspective and I will def. be staying here again if  and when I come back to Sin City.  \n\nThe bus stop is right outside the hotel and makes for easy access anywhere on the Strip.  \n\nAnother nice thing about this hotel is that you dont have to walk 20 minutes to the pool, or to the lobby, or to the food areas.  Everything is pretty close.	4
How is it I've never heard of this place and it's right behind where I live!?\n\nThis place is amazing. First of all, they HAND WASH your car and they do it INSIDE. I'm literally sitting in a beautifully air conditioned waiting room while I watch them meticulously detail my truck.\n\nDo not go anywhere else. Nick and his crew will take great care of you and your vehicle. I'd give them 10 stars if I could.	4
I love love love Iron Chef! The place itself is small but spacious and decorated very nicely. The staff are all very polite and attentive. The quality of the food is amazing and the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap. It's a great atmosphere and I consider this my favorite sushi joint in town :)	4
"Let me first say that I am not a burger eating kind of gal. I will be honest about having my doubts about paying for a $14 (on average) for a \""gourmet\"" burger. This place blew this thought out of the water fairly quickly. \n\nMy group and I decided to share 2 burgers and fries. What we learned was that we should have just either gotten the 2 burgers to share or 3 burgers instead. But honestly, we were pretty filled with the hell's kitchen (beef: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato) & southern yardbird (chicken: sharp cheddar, mustard BBQ sauce, pickle, butter lettuce) burgers and sweet potato fries. \n\nOur group had one guy so don't think it was only 3 girls with itty bitty appetites. We were all pretty filled and content after leaving this place to explore Planet Hollywood some more. The portion size was on the larger side as the meat patty was anything but small. The service was GREAT as our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful (I asked for recommendations for a cell phone repair place and our server asked around and came back with a place).\n\nI would absolutely recommend this place if you're wanting the most juicy and tender burgers--like ever. :) If you're visiting the casinos in the area, this place is a great place to eat--and in walking distance of the casinos as well. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is very popular so be patience if there is a slight line."	4
This boutique has something for everyone!  The clothing selection is always new and fresh, Cara and Beth are so friendly and helpful!	4

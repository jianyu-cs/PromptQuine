Just visited Khaos last week and I must say the outfits are cute but pricey and what really threw me off was you aren't allowed to take pictures of ANYTHING in the store. Funny thing, all I wanted to do was Twit how cute the stick on tattoos were but I was informed it was NOT ALLOWED...WOW. \nMy friend and I left the store empty handy and we were planning to buy.	0
"Streets of New York was, by far, the worst place I have ever been.\nMaybe it was just a location thing but I'll never go to another one because of it.\nWe get in and are told to sit anywhere so we pick a spot, sit down, and wait. and wait. and wait. \nThen a busser or someone who is obviously not a waiter comes over, literally throws us our menus and unenthusiastically says, \""She'll be with you in a minute.\""\nSo we wait, again.\nFinally she shows up, takes our drink orders and then disappears for another ten minutes. There's only like 4 other full tables in the place and she wasn't the only waiter; i'm pretty patient when waiting for foods and drinks at restraunts. On top of that, I've never had water that tasted so much like dirt before.\nShe comes back. Leaves. THEN comes back and takes our order. She asks us if we want their free bread and we say yes. TEN MINUTES later, the bread finally comes out and it's actually really good.\nThe pizza came out shortly after, finally our pizza comes out.\nWe did have a special order. One side was a chicken Alfredo pizza with Alfredo sauce, tomatoes, onions, and chicken and for me, I got cheese. Except my cheese pizza had onions on it. I couldn't eat it. And my companion's pizza was so terrible, no one finished it. There were little whole tomatoes soaked in vinegar; not sure what else was wrong with it.\n\nI will never. Ever. Go back to Streets Of New York. Not because of the food quality, but because of the service."	0
Tried this place again while I was getting my oil changed next door. Middle of the day, no one in the place and still lousy service. Ordered a beer that was flat. I told them about it and they changed the keg but didn't offer to replace the flat beer they gave me. I will say the service wasn't so much intentionally bad, I just think they don't known what they're doing. In any other city that may be fine but in the area they're in, there are much better choices.  Go to PTs or Porch Light. Seriously.	0
As soon as you walk in the front, the place is filled with smoke.  If you don't know where to go or try to ask a question, they point you to the direction. Like I'm supposed to know where the heck I'm going. Atmosphere definitely not friendly. When you go in, it felt like the main purpose was just to win money. I get that but you gotta have some fun. I was going with a group of friends and had a great time but once I lost where they were, I played a few games and was ready to get out. Staff unfriendly and guests were just as rude. Maybe a full moon was out and everyone was in a bad mood including the employees. When given another chance to go again, I'll try but don't really want to. Would not recommend this to anyone.	0
Horrible! Sunday playoffs and not enough servers?!?!? Wtf! Yes I said it ! 2nd bar area could not be open because not enough employees ?!?! Wow is this a franchise or corp. ? Owners get new management or more help! I am with a party of 16 and no attempt to even try to accommodate us?!?! Wow! I asked if we could just stand at the tables in second bar , and we would use the bar for service . But Jamie said NO! So instead we are left standing or sitting on the dance floor to watch the big screen .We are football fans/ drinkers! Jamie was of no help either! She's rude and useless when it comes to customer service! We are very disappointed with staff and overall experience.	0
"Maybe I have an abnormally high expectation of customer service, but this place really got my blood boiling. PItt's Dogg'n It doesn't, in fact, have anything to do with hotdogs. Okay, that's fine. But if I had to force you to take five seconds out of your precious phone conversation to tell me that, then there's a serious problem. And when you didn't in fact audibly say the word \""No,\"" when I asked you, \""Do you have any hot dogs,\"" and instead mouthed the word \""no,\"" then we have an even more serious problem. I was in the store for about 15 minutes looking around. On top of that, I made a transaction. Did the guy helping me get off the phone once? No. Did he greet me, ask me to sign my receipt, tell me to have a good day, utter the tiniest of annoyance in my direction? No. In fact, when it came time to sign my receipt, he pantomimed signing with a pen all while talking loudly on the phone. \n\nIf you can't even be bothered to get off the phone and greet the people who are spending money in your establishment then, frankly, you don't deserve any of my own or anyone else's money. \n\nLearn how to run a damn business or at least employ people that will show your business in a decent light."	0
I called the Cosmo 2 times to tell them the 6 of us would arrive after midnight - we were coming from Boston.  We arrive and I am told my 2 rooms have been given away so they put us in 2 Board Rooms with 2 full size Murphy Beds.  After 3 hours we finally get 2 rollaway beds brought to the room (it is now 3 am).  \n\nWe paid for the first night rooms so why did they give them away.  \n\nI find this totally unacceptable.  They moved us the next day but we had to stay in our room with our luggage until 4 pm when the rooms were ready so we missed out on a day in Vegas.\n\nI was there for a conference and many people had room problems so my advice stay at another hotel!\n\nThey also advertise the room with a kichenette, yup there is a stove and microwave but no utelsils, plate, pots & pans.  Why bother.	0
Craving a breakfast burrito and we decided we wanted Filibertos for breakfast.  Ordered in the drive thru and the young man's language barrier was so bad that we had to pull up to the window to communicate.  \n\nHe repeated our drink order five times. ..not one or twice,  but FIVE times and it was still wrong when we got home.  He didn't understand what root beer was and asked if it was blueberry?  REALLY? We ordered Mt Dew and learned that we got lemonade once we were home.  \n\nUgh, so frustrating.  I understand is Mexican food,  but at least put someone that can communicate in tyne drive thru window.  Because I'm pissed and im sure he's frustrated or maybe he doesn't give a shit. But you'd think that management would care when their food costs are increased because they have to correct do many mistakes by remaking the food.  \n\nOn a positive note,  the inside of the restaurant was very clean when I had to go back in for the wrong item to be corrected.	0
Well....uhh...Rhythm Kitchen puts forward a great effort to bring NOLA-style food to Vegas, but I gotta say they may need to make another trip down to the dirty south that I love so much and call home. We went here to watch some acquaintances play upstairs (which rocked btw) and we started with the spin/art dip (4 stars). For an entree decided I'd stick with something fried (that's what we do in the south - fry things) so I ordered the fried catfish (3 stars) with a side of red beans and rice (1 star). The catfish was 'aight', but the red beans and rice were pretty horrible I gotta say (to the point they had to be bathed in Tabasco before being edible). Service was okay, but the guy was SWAMPED and definitely needed help. I generally give places another shot, but I can't say I wanna head back here for seconds.	1
"I'm sad to say that Super Burrito \""fell off\"".  I've ordered twice here in the past few months and the food has not been good.  The burrito (Potato, Egg & Cheese) I'd been ordering for years was extremely greasy and undercooked.  Another time I ordered take out with my friend and the enchiladas were dry, lacked seasoning and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I felt so bad, I cooked up something for her at home.  I'm not sure if there is a new chef, but I am terribly disappointed in the recent changes."	1
After looking at the menu and having a groupon burning in my pocket I was pretty excited to try out Remington's Restaurant.  Unfortunately that's as far as the excitement went as far as dining experience went. \n\nPro's:\nLocation\n\nCon's:\nFly landing on bread bowl\nHost's dressed like morgue workers\nFood comes out with plastic dome's over it to keep warm but really wasn't too warm anyways\nFelt very dated inside \nServer pointed out total before groupon like I was going to stiff him on tip \n\nOverall I will not be back and wasn't impressed at all.  I guess if you are staying at the resort it's not a bad choice but I'd still go for a quick drive to one of the many other fine establishments within a short distance.	1
This place sucks.  First, if you're not a local they charge a ridiculous cover charge.  I had to pay $10 on a Wednesday!  Second, the female bartender has no personality and acts like you owe her for being there.  She totally hates her job and makes everyone feel that negative vibe.  The two guy bartenders were good in that they were at least responsive and attentive.  The show sucked and the drag queen that performed had a huge run in her stockings.  So second class.  Otherwise, it's an OK club.	1
this is the second time i've stayed at the Rio in ten years. We got there on a friday night at about 1am. When we got to the room, the beds were not made, towels on the floor, and drinks from the previous guests were on th bathroom counters. My wife called down to complain and they said they would send up housekeeping, but I thought an entirely different room was more appropriate so we went back to the front desk and requested and got a new room. The problem with a lot of mediocre establishments now is that there is no legitimate effort to make things right. The front desk person really acted as if giving us a dirty room and then changing it was no big deal. I guess this is why I probably will not go back, As I seem to get older I expect good if not great service all of the time. The oh, I'm sorry sir, here ya go kinda attitude really doesn't cut it anymore.	1
This place used to be really awesome now lately it just sucks.\nThe food is good but service sucks butt! No joke I gave it so many tries and it just seems like this place is just slowly down grading itself. \nI knew service was bad here but I figured maybe give it another go.\n\n:( Man was that a bad Idea. \n\nI order a spicy yellowtail roll and a eel  bento entree. My date order the salmon collar app and a beef hibachi entree.\nSo we knew collars take forever to come out so we ordered that first before even deciding what entrees we wanted. So the spicy yellowtail came out, and man that thing was the ugliest sushi I've ever seen. It was so half-ass made. The rice wasn't even sticking together the fish look so odd o.O it felt like a gamble to eat. \nSo then we got our soups that comes with the entree and I didn't even get to take a sip of it and my entree came out super fast and my date is left waiting for his for about 7 mins or so and I had to starting eating my food before it got cold. Now, were basically almost done eating and our collar never came. So I ask about how much longer, she had the balls to say I never ordered it! Are you serious that was the first thing I ordered after the drinks. \nAnd surprisingly it's nothing new they forgot my beer before and didn't even remember till I was done eating AND I had to ask for myself.\n\nThis place needs some serious 9-1-1 server training!\n\nI don't think I'm ever coming back again. \n\nI was so mad I was just like give me the check already.	1
"First time to visit, Saturday around 12:30. Not very busy. Waiter Ray.  Ordered an appetizer of ceviche, a beer and a blood orange sangria, which was great!  After about 20 mins, the waiter finally realized we never received our app.  He then tells us they are all out.  Our chips and salsa had been eaten...he took the chips to refill but not the salsa.  Finally got more salsa.  I ordered the beef stew which is a new item and my husband ordered the shrimp salad.  His salad was very good with great flavor.  The mango dressing was very tasty. The taste of the stew was very good but when I finally tossed the stew around abit I only found 1  - 1/4\"" x 1/4\"" piece of beef.  For the price it should have been more.  Brought the waiter over and he got me more which was better beef than the piece that was in there.   For our first visit, it won't be some place we would return to.  Flavor was good, sangria was good. Maybe Just an off day but there are many restaurants to choose from.  We'll stick with Brio or try our luck at Echo and Rig."	1
I eat here from time to time because it's close to my house.  The last time I was here I ordered the carne asada super burrito, it was good, filled with meat in every bite, not today!  This place is as so unpredictable with the quality and quantity of the food it's ridiculous!!!  The middle of the burrito had NO MEAT!!!  Seriously! !  Not sure if I will be coming back because I don't know what to expect.   What is really sad is if the owners actually read these reviews,  good and bad, they don't give a shit about the bad ones, because you never hear from them.......	1
Pizza is pretty good but nothing too special. For a place right on Fremont St I was surprised that it was so cheap though. Fairly extensive selection of draft beer for a pizza joint too. And what!? Brooklyn Beer in Las Vegas? Nice touch RCP.\n\nI will say, I witnessed an order of macaroni and bacon balls or something of the sort. That sounds too good to be legal, so I may have to be back to try that and perhaps adjust my rating accordingly.	2
We had la reggae and la Matty. The poutines we had were amazing! Best we ever had so far. We got takeout because we waited in line forever to be seated when we went in a group of 5 but they let the group of 5 after us seated before us. Why?! That's fine, we then got seated and was left there for 20 mins and nobody served us so we got up and ordered takeout. It sucks when a place's food is so amazing but the service is poor. I understand it's a 24/hr place and is constantly busy but at least make an effort in training and hiring the proper servers. This place would have so much more potential if their service improved. I will consider returning for takeout but def. not dining in.	2
Stayed here over Memorial Weekend and a friend booked 2 rooms for a group of us. The hotel itself was pretty good, but it being my first time in Sin City since turning 21+ I had always imagined I would be staying on the Strip but I didn't mind in favor of saving money!\n\nThe suites were quite spacious, probably could have easily fit our entire group into one. Each room comes with 2 fulls/queens (I don't know how to tell mattress sizes...), TV, desk, sitting area with an arm chair, sofa, and coffee table, full size bathroom including separate bathtub and shower stall, a mini kitchen with a microwave, minifridge, sink, and a breakfast table. In addition to all this, the other room had a two-range electric stove in the minikitchen though we didn't have one in ours...\n\nThe only gripes I have about the place is their slight slow response to housekeeping requests, such as extra towels or blankets. At one point we had called 3 times to check up on our extra blankets until late at night. The other gripe I have is the distance from the Strip. While it wasn't really too far, it gets pretty tiring going back and forth a few times in a day. We didn't want to drive anywhere within Vegas so we would commute back and forth by walking. At times it wouldn't be too bad, until the blazing sun would come out and pound on us, or just when exhaustion from walking all day gets to you. After a few times, we learned to cut through Bally's Casino down the street since it was air-conditioned! Yay!\n\nLastly, they had a restaurant on the casino floor that had a midnight special on steak and eggs for $3.99 that also includes hash browns and your choice of bread. While I didn't personally get to try it, all my friends enjoyed it tremendously - I'm sure the price made it all the more better too ;). For those interested, the special is only good between the hours of 12am - 5am. But if you just miss it, they have a special on a burger and fries for $4.99 which I heard was also quite good.\n\nExtras: pretty nice lobby with a counter for half-price show tickets but a rather small pool :\\\n\nSo, overall 3 stars. It is a fairly nice place and sufficient enough for those wanting to save money. I would recommend this place to friends looking for cheaper alternatives and for them to bring comfortable shoes!	2
Entering the restaurant I was welcomed with a warm smell of delicious food.  The atmosphere was very cute.  I'd imagine this place probably looks adorable at Christmas time.  Sadly I was disappointed with my meal.  I got the special: tilapia and artichokes in a lemon sauce with steamed vegetables on the side.  The tilapia was mediocre.  Fishier than normal for tilapia. My friend tried it and thought so too. I'm willing to give this place another shot,  so I'll likely be back.  As of my experience tonight I have nothing to rave about.	2
An above-average airport spot.  I was there on National Margarita Day - 2/21 - Yay!  Only I had a beer, Rita's were a bit pricy.\n\nAny who -- I had a chopped salad & was able to sub pork al pastor for the grilled chicken.  Great call!  The Al pastor flavor was very nice & a great complement to the cilantro dressing on the chopped salad.\n\nFriendly service & easy in and out.  Best part was I could see my gate & was able to sit comfortably until they started boarding.	2
"Although I''m reluctant to go to a theme restaurant inspired by an SNL sketch I found cheeburger cheeburger to be better than a theme restaurant with mediocre food, I was here once before when Tempe marketplace first opened and was overwhelmed by the topping choices Think last time I had a burger with feta, mushrooms, and olives trying to imagine a Mediterranean    burger, really what ended up happening was flavor overload that I couldn't really taste the burger so I decided to give them another try, this time around I got 1/2 lbs burger (sorry a pound is just too much food) with cheddar jack, bacon and sauteed mushrooms, we ordered a half order of the \""best of both worlds\"" which is a basket of fries and onion rings with a side of cheese , the fries are good very crispy well seasoned and appear to be fresh cut  or at least a very convincing fake, the onions rings are very crispy with a light batter that almost takes on a yellow tone, my burger was well prepared they use sliced whole mushrooms instead of pre sliced, the bacon was crispy and the cheese was nice and gooey, so all in all it was a pretty decent burger, I must say my burger was a bit greasy I cut my burger in half to eat it and by the time I moved on to the second half  my lower bun had become one and fused with my burger patty\n\nOverall my experience was good, and I would go back but I don't see it being a frequent choice and not just due to distance, the main attraction seems to be the wide variety of burger toppings and the build-your-own inspired menu, despite the food being consistent and good it's nothing I haven't tasted before, though if I ever get the urge for a pepperoni, peanut butter, coleslaw, Sri racha burger, I can sleep easier at night knowing I've now got that issue handled"	2
We went to this place for a friend's graduation party around 11pm. I agree with the other posters that this is a very odd shaped bar! It felt very segregated and did not really allow for cross party interaction as the place is basically split into two. The karaoke was fun and the guy running it was a cool older guy. He did a couple songs too! Didn't try any of the food this time around but kind of want to go back to redeem myself from a bad karaoke attempt lol. It did take a while to get a drink. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas. There were two girls working the bar and it still took quite a while to have my order taken. I didn't want to get up in their faces so I was waiting towards the end of the bar and eventually had to have a seat it was taking so long.	2
This was just ok.  Nothing really special about them.  I ordered korean beef short robs combo that came with shredded pork loin, egg quiche,  and pork egg rolls.  Overall..just ok. The shredded pork was good but had a weird grain or texture that I couldn't figure out.  My boyfriend ordered beef pho...it was good. Thw soup had good flavor.\nNot the best in town...my favorite is still Pho Saigon 8.	2
The apple pancakes were piping hot and full of apple, cinnamon and real maple syrup. This place has a cool early morning vibe: mixture of old folks, families and business people getting ready for the day and enjoying the company and the food. \n\nService could be faster, but the place was slammed.	3
Went for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It was a Thursday night at 8 and the place was full but we didn't wait at all as I think we got the last table.  I've been here one other time on a Friday or Saturday and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 2.  The service was good and pretty quick for how busy they were.\n\nWe tried the Ruben and it was one of the better Rubens we have had.  The sides were a little better than average, but the broccoli slaw was outstanding.  We also had the London broil, better than average but just a little tough.  The jerk chicken quesadilla was amazing and we would definitely get it again.\n\nWe will come back here for sure, for the food, the good beer selection, and the chill atmosphere.  A great place.  Would have given five stars had the menu been a little bigger offering more variety.	3
The scene of my favorite springtime lunch activity.  What is it?  Getting a mozzarella sandwich and than heading over to Steele Indian School park and heckling the urban fisherman as they struggle in vain to bring in their catch of garbage fish.\n\nThe sandwich is magical in its simplicity.  The rest of the sandwich world should take note.	3
A total hole in the wall place! Just ate here and it was quite tasty! The owner was super friendly and had a tasting a bunch of pastry samples. My husband had the burger and really enjoyed it. I had the southwest wrap and was unsure of it but the owner said he wouldn't charge me if I didn't like it. Needless to say, I paid. Oh yeah! We als split fries which were cooked to perfection and seasoned with pepper. So delicious! \nThe only awkward part was the ambiance. There was no music or anything so we felt like we had to talk softly so as not to disturb the other diners. We will definitely be back.	3
Update as of 2/6/14...\n\nTip: sit at the bar if you can, the service will be more prompt and attentive, and it's a bit more warm (in the winter months)\n\nTip #2: ask for the extra spicy Blazing Saddle margarita. It features an even spicier infused tequila\n\nTip #3: visit during happy hour (4:30pm - 6:30pm); two margaritas and two beers were less than $15\n\nLooks like the menu has been slightly revamped; the bar menu features some street tacos that looked absolutely superb. Alas, I was off to Tempest for dinner, so there wasn't any food consumed during this most recent visit.	3
We just are in love with the smoked wings here as well as the chicken salads. The bread pudding is a fav as well.	3
Moving to Las Vegas, I found excellent Vietnamese, Japanese and Thai; to make me feel absolutely at home, those staples need to be rounded out with smoked jerk chicken. I ate at a couple of places before finding this one is just the way I like it. The chicken is tender, not too spicy, served with two wonderful homemade sauces. The spicy sauce was way too hot for me when I put just a dab on my finger, but eaten together with the chicken, was nice and flavorful and not very spicy at all. I was really surprised. Plantains are tasty you get a nice salad and traditional delicious rice. A huge plus was homemade watermelon juice. I love homemade lemonade - but this is going to replace some of that.  \n\nThe restaurant is no frills , so this one is all about the food. It was a bit hard to locate the place at first. When you get off 15 going North Take Charelston East to 3rd street and it is just about on the corner. You should see a sign on the sidewalk. \n\nEnjoy man, enjoy...	3
First time here. Stopped here early morn(6am) for a trip from California to Colorado .. Good food, quick service and a very friendly staff.	3
One of my friends got a facial from Charlotte Plastic Surgery, first of all when she got in my car, I noticed that she looked really pretty before she even said anything..  then she said she went to CPS for a facial.  She said, that she scraped her face with a razor and got all the dead skin off.  Stop right there.  I want my face free of dead skin.\n\nSo, I made an appointment and went today..  egads, loved it..  I am very no nonsense, I like to cut right to the chase.  Going to a surgeon's office is not for relaxation, they mean business!!!  Love, love, love!!!  \n\nMelody scrubbed my face with a soft rotary Sonic brush, scraped off dead skin, then did this oxygen treatment on me to calm my red face. The treatment was wet and cold, it felt better than the mister at Disneyworld.  My first question was, when can I come back?\n\nIt seems like most Yelpers are young and you aren't worried about your skin, but please take care of it, start wearing sunscreen daily, don't forget about your hands and neck too.  Your hands really are the first to show age.. Sunscreen my friends.\n\nBoys this isn't for girls only, everyone would love to get their face scrubbed, believe me!!!\n\nMelody!!  Remember!!	4
I love a good cup of frozen yogurt.  So far Yogurtland is my favorite chain to visit!  This one is pretty close to my house too, so it makes it even more tempting.  \n\nWhat draws me into a place like Yogurtland is it's layout and decor.  I love the modern style of most of the Yogurtland interiors, it's kinda like an IKEA!  I love the straight lines, the use of dark wood, the colors.  Yes, to some folks this kind of design in BLAH and BLEH and boring but I love clean.  I am a clean and near-clutter free FREAK.  So I like the minimalism and the organization.  Planning is good!\n\nWe go here at least once a month.  Myself, I'm more into the yogurt flavors themselves and checking out what Yogurtland has to offer on a monthly basis.  My kids however?  More into the toppings.  Little itty bitty amounts of yogurt, and lots of toppings!  This is what can make your damn cup of frozen yogurt so expensive!  And at the current 35 cents an ounce it can be quite the price for that cup.  Last time, my little one got like 3 tiny hills of yogurt and topped it mochi balls, almonds, gummy worms, cheesecake, and God knows what else...and it ended up costing me $7!  Yeah, watch your kids!\n\nI actually like the yogurt and want to try most flavors on every occasion.  But I always stick to my faves:  Taro, Plain Tart, and Coconut.  Yep, you guessed it, I'm Asian!  The only gripe I have sometimes is that Taro is not always in stock with the yogurt machines.  It should be a C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T and never, ever rotated out!  It's kinda what defines Yogurtland as being an Asian-founded frozen yogurt shop!  As for toppings I kinda go light, but I do love the fresh fruit:  strawberries, mango, lychee, pineapple, and blueberries often end up at the party.  Yogurtland froyo makes a yum-yum in my tum-tum.\n\nThis newer place seems to always be busy - it is after all located in the same area as a Rubio's, Five Guys, and Firehouse Subs.  It's like a one-stop-shop for eats!  Yogurtland is situated right in the middle so it definitely capitalizes in some after meal dessert.  I can only suspect that Yogurtland will get busier as the good ol' Las Vegas summer heat rolls around.  \n\nAre you HOT?  Go to Yogurtland!  Not so HOT?  Go somewhere else.  Just kidding!  Yogurtland will give you healthy macrobiotic eats whether you're ugly or not!	4
Nestled inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this joint provides a fun, relaxing atmosphere with premium food.\n\nMusic lil loud, but where in Vegas isn't, right? The jams fit the age of the crowd everyone was singing along having a blast.\n\nBone -in Rib eye= succulent \nMushrooms = flavorful\npotato's  a delight.  \nBread with there oil and pesto sauce = WOW.. please dont remind me, im so hungry now...\n\nits a better alt then a mundane buffet i think. but then again the wicked spoon on the second fl. is legit too.\n\nplus, you night actually see some celebrities.	4
Simply put: The way a business should be run.  \n\nI have been using the Lakes Cleaners since I moved to Las Vegas and the work they do is exemplary.  The owner's name is Carol and she couldn't be anymore sweeter.  She doesn't just dry clean clothes, but she honestly takes a genuine interest in all her customers.  Not only does she remember whats going on with me, but I see her have these kinds of conversations with everyone who walks through the door.  The Summerlin/Lakes community is lucky to have this gem of a place serving it. \n\nHer prices are reasonable and, her turnaround times are efficient and the attention to detail is amazing.  You cant really see the Lakes Cleaners from the street but its in the plaza at Sahara and Durango behind the Subway and 7-11.  Once you find it however, I can honestly say you wont go anywhere else.\n\nGoing to the cleaners isn't a task or chore when visiting the Lakes, its one of the highlights of my week!	4
This place is fairly new and right around the corner from me. I ordered the won ton soup as usual. It was excellent. (I always request extra cilantro - I no longer have to because they know now how I like it) The Hot Basil is pretty much my regular meal there. I ask for Thai hot and is usually comes just right. The cashew nut with chicken is very good as well. My wife got the pineapple fried rice. It was ok. Not my favorite fried rice. But what throws them over the top is they have Pepsi. Not Coke. Highly recommend this place as one of the best Thai in Gilbert.	4
Best service ever and best food ever! Delicious pizza and appetizer! Best vodka ever and locally owned! Bam bam we love Carlos! Will go back.	4
Service was fast and extremely friendly, coffee was great, and I will definitely return!\n\nI love that they have a little drive thru and they offer so many sugar free options.  It's a refreshing way to grab a drink anytime!	4
"Think soup Nazi for Italian food.  You either love it or you hate it.  I think their modus operandi is to size up a table and treat you with an attitude.  If you have thick skin, will open your wallet, and are \""real\"" to them, they'll treat you like family; if not, they'll kick you out, as they did to a young couple next to us.\n\nI chose the Chilean sea bass with Ravioli and it was incredible.  Our waiter took shots with our table and our service and food were great.  It's a dining experience I recommend to anyone."	4

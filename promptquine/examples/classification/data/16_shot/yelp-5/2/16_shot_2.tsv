I had a yellow cab driver almost run me over at the airport this morning. Not only do 1/2 scam you, they are also some of the rudest cabbies in town. It's no wonder companies like Uber are taking over their business.	0
"Shame on Maria and Kings Appliance. One star is too many for this place. Maria in the office can't be trusted and was not accountable for her mistakes. It began when I filed a home warranty claim and Kings took two business days to call me back. When I finally spoke to someone to schedule the appointment, I was told the technician will arrive between 10am-2pm, and the call ended. So I expected a knock on the door or a ring of the bell between 10am-2pm- I purposely had someone at the residence waiting for Kings arrival. 1pm rolled around and I received two voicemails during a meeting stating that since I've missed their call, the appointment is now cancelled. The fact is, I was NOT told to expect a call prior to the techs arrival. Kings never even asked for my number because if they had asked, knowing I'd be busy all day, I would've provided the number to the person so kindly waiting at the home. Maria was unapologetic for the mess, condescending and flat out lied about the phone call stating, \""now you know we always call prior to arrival\"". Excuse me- I know? How the heck am I to know this important piece of info? I do not work there, I've not ever used this company before and I was never told to expect a call. And why would the office call prior to the arrival as opposed to the tech? Maria was nasty, not empathetic for her mistake and the frustration that it caused. She's a liar, unprofessional and deserves every piece of karma coming her way. And the service contract she has with the home warranty co. should be cancelled and shredded out of common decency to the paying clients of the home warranty company that must deal with such childish behavior."	0
If you're into the very loud electronic music club vibe on the water and care not for quality of food and drink then this is your place. I'm not sure who in my partner's family picked this place for a wedding rehearsal dinner, but I feel like I should blame the wedding planner who missed a lot of details re the wedding itself (then I can keep the blame outside the family).\n\nWe were trying to have a dining/family/celebration experience in a restaurant, but it felt like a nightclub. And the food was insultingly terrible. Who's this Apollo guy? Hopefully not a famous chef. OK, so the food was edible. Nothing was inedible. But it should have been WAY better for the price. I make better risotto in my sleep.\n\nAnother waterfront/riverfront place that thinks it doesn't have to be good because it attracts business based on its location alone. I'd avoid.	0
"Never again.  The rooms are not that nice and the charges are outrageous.  We checked in for a three night stay which I got at a great deal since we stayed last year (which was just bad as well, but I thought I would give them a second chance and take advantage of saving some money), but then they wanted to add an additional 50.00 (150.00!!)  per night as security ON TOP OF the 20.00 per day \""resort fee\""!!?!?  I don't think so!! I think they got the clue when I told them I would not be paying that and we were more than prepared to take our business elsewhere.  All of a sudden they were \""nice enough\"" to \""waive\"" that made up fee.  NEVER AGAiN!!! DON'T DO IT!!!!  If you don't have the money to visit Vegas properly, save a little longer! This place is a discgrace to Vegas!!"	0
Amazon needs to forget about using them! My shipment never was received- they try to deliver at 8 PM- after my gate is closed- but we have a CALL BOX and they must not know how to use a phone because no one bothers.  So instead of my Amazon Prime order being received 5 days ago as expected, they sent it back today. This company is a joke, and I may be cancelling Amazon Prime and not using amazon if this continues. \n\nAVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS	0
I was in Vegas on 7/17/10.  I reserved a night through Expedia (Expedia was great), but the hotel was horrible!\n\nWhen we received the room, it was EXTEMELY hot inside, the air had not been on and it was about 110 degrees outside.  I had to use my sholder to open the door, the air was not working properly; I called for a different room and they said to wait while it cools.  Believe me, it was not cooling.  Then decided to take a cold shower to keep cool... now the toilet wasn't working!  I went to the front desk (still HOT) to at least ask for a part of my money back (had only been there about an hour.  The lady said, they had no more rooms and she couldn't do anything about it.  I would have to wait for maintenance. \n\nExpedia gave me a coupon to partially compensate.  The hotel finally found another room, which was ALOT better, in comparison to what we had\n\nI'm not one to complain, but after this experience I have more than reason to.  WILL NEVER GO BACK! please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions.	0
Clueless and slow	0
The soup was amazing, but that's about it. Noddles were super under cooked and seemed rushed. Tried to order in Japanese and got attitude for it, my bad every other Japanese place can either speak it or say I don't know how to speak Japanese without attitude. We were no even done eating and the server came twice asking if we were done as we are still eating. She mind as well kicked us out and ask for a tip. Still tipped her good for her garbage service.	0
Horrible. I'm pretty sure everything came out of a bag. Chips were stale and I've had better cheese at a truck stop push spout. I'm not sure how they made the guacamole, but I'm certain there wasn't any avocado in there. Extra bonus - everything was served cold.	0
Such a shame!!!  We have been dining at Abuelos for over 3 years now and the service and food has always been incredible.  My wife and I frequented Abuelos a few years ago for the great happy hour and incredible service by one of the bartenders i believe his name was john.  We would walk in and instantly he would have our drinks and greet us with a smile and small talk.  Unfortunately he's been gone for some time now and since leaving, the bar service is less than average.  We are very low maintenance and simple to please but for some reason it feels like we're a burden on the staff now.  Occasionally we will ask where John went and the guy that worked with him for years will shrug and say he doesn't know but his reaction is always strange.  We used to love Abuelos but now we are simply displeased with the service and the lack of friendly comfort we used to feel.  They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!	0
Overpriced. Greasy. Not good.  What wasn't greasy was too salty. My first and last experience with dim sum. I would have rather set my hard earned $$ on fire.	0
This place is THE WORST. They have the most unfriendly, unhelpful, unknowledgable staff I've ever come across. I went in to buy some new coils and after me telling them I had a mini pro tank 2 and them personally looking at it, they sold me the wrong coils. Accidents happen right? I went back not 15 minutes after buying them to get properly fitting coils and they tried to refuse me a refund and were genuinely rude about the whole situation. I just wanted proper coils, not a refund, which I had already explained. However, they were still demanding that I pay for the bad ones they sold me in the first place. After trying to do fucking calculus with these people about refunds and replacement I finally got some coils that fit.... Only to find out that they were bad, didn't work, and shorted my battery. I gave up. \n\nRude staff that know nothing about vapes. \nPoor business practices. \nNon-functioning products. \n\nVape stores are popping up all over the city, we don't have to support one that doesn't function properly.	0
"Even though this is the place to go to when in Vegas, it was definitely not the place for me & my group of friends. We came here back in March. Our friend had a \""hook up\"" that got us in for free, but the place was so damn crowded that it took us 2 hours to walk through the whole place! Drinks were freaking expensive, and there was barely any room to stand. My friends managed to get a corner by the bar, but they were constantly spilling their drinks because there were 2 single file lines of people trying to get by and pushing. I've never been claustrophobic before, but this place definitely brought that out in me!\n\nWe stood by the bar area for about 10 minutes and decided it was too hot and stuffy, so we all left. Took us about another 45 minutes just to get OUT of the club!"	0
Went on a Friday night a little after 7pm and there were 3 tables occupied. Went with 3 other couples. We quickly got our first round of drinks and ordered our food. Then it all went downhill. We waited over an HOUR for our good. When we finally received our food, it would come out 1 or 2 meals at a time, with at least a 10 minute lapse in between the next meal delivery. Drink refills were also ridiculously slow. The food was good, but I think that's because we were starving by the time we received it. We were dining with friends, not eating in shifts. No apologies, nothing from the 3 waitresses on duty. Mind you, there were only 4 tables occupied at any given time on FRI night! Ridiculous. Icing on the cake was the bill had not been separated like asked and gratuity was built in. Will NEVER return.	0
"DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL UNLESS YOU ARE A TRUST FUND BABY!!!!!!!!!!\nI would NOT recommend taking clasees to start your own business at this school. The office staff  is NOT transparent  at all about what ACTUALLY happens to the majority of the students here: unemployed, unable to run a business off what people are actually willing to pay for hypnotherapy and \""nutritional counseling\"" this school does not license people to do anything special at all and I am COMPLETELY sick at the thought of what they are brainwashing students with that does NOT actually prepare them for the REAL WORLD in this economy. I am working in a retail store after obtaining my \""degree\"" and struggling to pay my student loans off. The \""degree\"" is WORTHLESS. The education may be adequate but I know at least 3 dozen SWIHA students working at banks and businesses totally unrelated to health care. I couldnt even get hired in a doctor's office as a receptionist with this crapole degree. Do not go here unlesss you have rich parents or a rich husband that has thousands of dollars to give you for about five years to start a wellness business in a major recession."	0
The lines around dinner and lunch time are always colossal, almost equally so to some of the people standing in them.\n\nI was impressed by the variety of food available here when I managed to finally get in. I guess my choosiness allowed me to luck out and grab the best parts of the meatloaf and pot roast. However, even considering this, the foods seem to contain very high levels of salt. I had four glasses of water by the time I was done with my meal.\n\nThe service isn't bad for such a prodigiously crowded eatery but I won't be coming back until I hear about their food improving.\n\nBut, hey, at least it's cheap. It's dirt cheap compared to many restaurants in the area, although you can't expect too much.	1
"With little or no time left before I had to head to see \""O\"", I grabbed a quick bite at Snack Bar. I got a bit nervous at first because the line was so so so long, but it move very quickly. They must have it down to a science. You are in and out (ordering your food that is) within ten minutes. Pretty good for a non-fast-food eatery. The only down size of it being so packed, was that there was really no place to sit. Thankfully, I got my order just as a couple was leaving, so I was able to sit for five minutes to scarf down my food. Speaking of the food. It was decent. Not the worst, but defiantly not the best (especially in this town). I had a simple grilled chicken with salsa and guacamole. The chicken was a bit dry and spicy and the guacamole was average."	1
This place sucks! Just try to buy your tickets an hour before the movie shows. Because there is always a long line, and when you buy your ticket all the seats in the theatre is all taken up, and your left with the first two row seats. Sometimes the light aren't in in the theatre too so you can see the open seats when the movie hasn't even started. One of the cashiers pressured me to buy other junk food when all I sad was a small popcorn will be all. Oh yeah! The managers don't give a rats Azz if people talk in the theatre too.	1
The restaurant is pretty comfortable.  The chairs and booths are really comfortable and a great spot for large groups.\n\nThe service can use a real improvement.  6 of us met there for dinner not knowing that there was a Coyotes game going on.  The bar was really busy but the dining area was, at best, half full.  Our food took forever and my glass of water was empty most of the meal.  I had ordered wine and asked for it to come with my meal but he gave it to me with the waters along w/ everyone else.  \n\nthe food was alright.  pretty basic.  the meal could have been at Chili's, Applebees or any other assorted chain.\n\nI would like to check their happy hour out one day, I sense it's a good deal.	1
This place was a bit of a disappointment. The photos on the menu look nothing like the meals that come out of the kitchen. My son ordered the seafood mix, which had little sea food and lots of water and veggies without taste. He said it was awful. I had the Hawaiian chicken bowl and instead of nice looking chicken strips in a large bowl with rice and veggies, I got a small bowl with small bites of chicken soaked in teriyaki sauce and wilted cabbage piece. Not very good. \n\nSo do not come here because the food is not represented well by the menu.	1
This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels.	1
Stayed here on two different occasions. The first was in the West Tower. Clean & remodeled. The second was in the Casino Tower. One word: COCKROACH. It also smelled strongly of detergent and the carpet was worn and badly stained.\n\nI did like that there were shops and many places to dine at. Also, another plus was the large variety of slot machines.\n\nIf you want to avoid all the children, go while school is in session. We last stayed here in early November and it was really mellow.	1
Server was very good, the coffee was delicious.  The food was terrible.  My pancake was god-awful.  The good news was that the staff noticed I wasn't eating it and took it off my bill without me asking, which was nice.  I don't know I'd go back...the creepy guy camped out at the entrance was not necessarily their fault but the food was, and so I'd probably hunt for something else next time I am in town.	1
DID YOU KNOW ALL THE CHEESECAKE FACTORIES ARE THE SAME?  \n\nI have been to a few of them, and this one was like the others.  If you like one where ever you are, then you'll like this one.  \n\nSERVICE:  \nThe wait is long if you go around dinner time.  We waited, gambled, and drank to get a buzz and went later than 9:00 p.m.   So, we got seated fairly quickly.  The service...nothing special...it's what you'd expect at any Cheesecake Factory restaurant.  \n\nFOOD QUALITY:  \nThe food was okay.  It was, as I said earlier, like any other Cheesecake Factory on the planet.  \n\nWOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?: \nProbably not.	1
This is a very clean very nice establishment. They're staff is super cool, prolly the best staff in town. However, their prices are absolutely ridiculous. They are really taking advantage of people that either can't grown their own or are desperate to not be in pain. Either way the prices are the highest I've seen anywhere here in the AZ.	1
"Once again, I find myself stunned by the difference in my experience and that of other reviewers.   There is no way this was even a three star experience for our company of three.  Saba's is a pretty restaurant, but that's where the good review ends.\n\nWe arrived at dinner time on a Sunday.   I can't say that we felt very welcomed.  \n\nThere was one large table of customers and one small booth, so the restaurant was not very busy.   I had the feeling that the large table may have been family.   They received all the attention of the staff, leaving us feeling as though we'd crashed a private event.  \n \nWe had to wait for someone to seat us while being studiously ignored by the staff that was in the restaurant when we arrived.   There's nothing worse to me than knowing that someone is aware of your presence,  but won't even look in your direction .  A smile, a quick \""someone will be with you\"", any acknowledgement is so much better than being obviously ignored.   It's not as though the restaurant was full.\n\nThe service was ok.  Although we ordered a sharing platter for appetizers, we had to ask for extra plates. The ordering process was disjointed, the host asked us for our drink order as an afterthought, and then forgot to bring them.  \n\nWe found the food to be pretty bland.   The hummus and eggplant were completely unseasoned.  For the first time ever in a Mediterranean restaurant we added salt, due to the lack of acid in the preparation.   It's probably a good thing that we weren't crazy about the appetizer platter, since it was pretty sparse.   The saganaki arrived with none of the usual fanfare, or flavor.  It was just a salty crusty overcooked piece of cheese that hardened into a tough and chewy texture more like a jerky than anything else. \n\n The fattoush salad was also low on seasoning.   No kick whatsoever.    I have no idea what they used to dress the salad, but it just wasn't very good.   I was very disappointed, since fatthoush is usually one of my favorites.  This one just seemed slick with flavorless dressing.   The same for the dolmas, which had a dubious texture and very little flavor.   I think  the chef could use an introduction to that lovely assistant known as a lemon. \n\nThe spanikopita and tsatsiki were pretty good and the chicken kabob platter that included attractive looking grilled vegetables was nicely cooked, but also no seasoning.    \n\nAlthough we only ordered appetizers, salad and one entree between 3 of us, we left a lot of food on the plates.    \n\nWe were scouting the area prior to a re-location, but Saba's will not be one of the spots we'll be looking forward to revisiting."	1
The location was great, right on the strip. The ambience was nice too. The food, though, was a little disappointing. We opted for the rodizio and they served things like turkey and pineapple. Not an authentic brazilian churrascaria. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't authentic and unique as I had expected. Also, It was a bit pricey, I guess because of the location.	1
The main benefit of this Goodwill is that it's large. That's a good thing, because at least 50% of what it contains is utter crap. \n\nReally, they will put just about anything on the shelf. I've seen spaghetti sauce jars, canisters with no lids, broken electronics, you name it. Or sometimes items are priced for more than what they would cost new. $1.00 for a mason jar? Really?\n\nThough, this is where I scored a Loverboy album, and a sweet American flag patterned vest for my Tea Party protestor costume.\n\nAlso, it's between Dollar Tree and Tuesday Morning. So you can get all your cheapo shopping done at once.	1
"Perhaps because this is close to ASU they think no one will notice the quality of sushi. Because students run in and out or do take out perhaps no one bothers to say anything. But the reality is for people that enjoy good fish, soft rice and dont mind spending the extra few $$ for quality this is not the place for you. I always think of this place as \""fast food sushi\""..It comes out fast but I ALWAYS feel something is either missing or wrong. If I am in the area and with friends and they want a low cost sushi experience I will go but then I do simple rolls that are harder to screw up. Not the worst, not the best..but maybe just right for the students that visit the most.\n\nps. I dont live close so I dont go for happy hour. This review is based on non happy hour service. From reviews it is clear they put a lot of effort into alcohol and happy hour. Perhaps after 2-3 drinks the fish tastes better or the price makes it worth while to come back."	1
Not the worst by far from the best. If your name has the main dish in it you better stand out from everyone else including Mc Donald's pushing the same thing, especially if you're gonna overcharge. \nNot consistent enough for me to go back a fourth time.\nSorry guys find some other sucker to pay your rent.\nIf my fellow yelpers must go here to get ur poutin fix keep it simple, and whatever you do stay away from the braised beef!!!\nI don't know what that animal was, but it wasn't no cow!	1
used to be my heaven on earth - but not the same now as under new management/ ownership. Still got a nice covered front terrace to sit outside.	1
Man, I swear this place has gone in the dumps. They used to offer supurb breakfast there. It has been my staple for my annual work trips to Vegas. I told everyone they had the best pancakes you'll find. Ordered them this time and they were like cement. Went back the next day and had the Benedict. Everything tasted canned. A step down, and a generous three stars. Literally no different than your local Denny's...	2
I overheard that this was the second largest F21 location in the world. I'm not surprised, because this mall is also HUGE!\n\nWith that said, this place is just too big. Where do you start and on which floor?\n\nGirls will love this place for their variety and relatively affordable prices.	2
Silky noodles, perfectly yolky eggs, but a salty broth..I was so excited to eat at this restaurant, but was a little disappointed. I couldn't finish my soup, perhaps because I added mustard greens. Points on the poached egg.. the best excuse for high cholestrol out there! It's right next to Raku.	2
I have yet to have a 5 star experience here to date.  Can't believe this place is rated this highly.  I've been trying to give them a chance to impress me since they first opened their doors but so far it's nothing but very average Mexican food.  Before writing this review I thought I'd visit them one more time since it had been awhile. Maybe somethings changed I thought.  Nope...still extremely average and not worth driving cross town for but if you're in the area and hungry then go for it.  Yesterdays choice was a carnitas burro and a order of super nachos.   My biggest problem with my two choices yesterday and with every visit I've ever made here is there is just not much flavor to the food.  In my opinion you can usually judge a Mexican food place by the salsa that arrives with your chips before you order. If they can't make a good salsa you can pretty much be assured the rest of your experience will match the salsa experience.  That being said this place has the most flavorless salsa I've ever tasted.	2
OK... I've had two experiences... one for Shutters through House of Window Coverings and one for draperies and roman shades that are Costco purchases that are handled through house of Window Coverings.\n\nThe SHUTTERS ARE A 5 STAR EXPERIENCE. The Costco purchase has been a ZERO star purchase. All in all it will average out at a 3. It's too bad, Christopher and the Norman Shutter team really deserved 5 stars!\n\nBottom line, Christopher was terrific. We were on a very tight time deadline and he not only met it, but he helped make it happen. I had called the week before we needed them and were told they were scheduled to arrive the next week. Normally they wait until they have shutters in hand before they schedule installation - however, HWC requested that we get installation the day after they arrived and they made it happen.\n\nGreat work by House of Window Coverings on making the shutters happen!  \n\nAs for the draperies and roman shades, more than THREE WEEKS LATE and we still don't have them.....	2
Brand new 101 here hit the ground running this morning at 10 AM.  It's a big, pretty place featuring sushi made while you watch, & I counted up 88 food items, plus sauces & dressings.\n\nAfter landing in a comfortable booth, I started with their Hot & Sour Soup, which was delicious, & had meat in it... something I always appreciate.  There were most of the regular items that we have come to expect at a good-sized Chinese Buffet, & here are a few more tastes that stood out for me:\n\n*  Excellent Salad Bar, with SIX dressing choices!\n\n*  Delicious, bone-in BBQ Pork Spare Ribs!\n\n*  Big, tasty breaded, fried shrimp!\n\n*  Scallops on the half-shell, with a shrimp thrown in too, just for fun!\n\n*  Oysters on the half-shell!\n\n*  Your choice of several flavors of REAL ice cream!\n\nSo here's an fun new Chinese Buffet in North Phoenix.  3 1/2-Stars!	2
"For some reason, Talking Stick has been sending me \""free night\"" stays for the whole summer, so we have been able to enjoy regular staycations for the past 4 months. This past weekend I decided to finally give the spa a shot, taking advantage of their \""Luxury for Locals\"" deal that they have going on for the summer (through Sept 30). I get massages regularly and have always been hesitant to go to hotel spas for the services as I have not had great experiences in the past. They seem to be overpriced and never as good as I want. But, with the free room and summer deal, I figured why not! I chose to get their Simply Essential Massage and add on the Summer Shine Body Polish.\n\nThe reception area didn't impress me too much. I like to have a calming atmosphere right when I go into a spa, but I was greeted with rock music and tacky products placed all over for sale. The shirts they were selling have that cheesy \""bachelorette party\"" feel and I wasn't a fan of being overwhelmed with cheap jewelry and products right when walking in. The staff is friendly and quick to take you on the tour of the area, so that was a positive.   \n\nI have always loved the clean, modern, and calm feel of the rooms at the Talking Stick. The spa decor is exactly the same - lots of rich, dark browns contrasted with lighter hues to provide a calming environment. The spa has all the typical amenities you would expect for a resort spa: changing room, lockers, fluffy robes & slippers, dressing area, jacuzzi, steam room, and relaxation area. All areas were clean and decorated nicely. I didn't come early enough to do a ton of relaxing beforehand, but got to explore the area enough.\n\nI got my massage from Bernadette, and was very pleased with the quality of the session. I was worried that since it was a traditional Swedish massage that she wouldn't get into my muscles as much as I wanted, but she did a really nice job of combining relaxation and some muscle work. The sheets on the table were AMAZING...I honestly felt like I was floating because of how soft and silky they were.  The body polish was an interesting experience. It's basically a full body exfoliation using a sugar scrub, followed by rinsing off in the shower, then full body application of a body butter. It felt good, but I would probably opt for a facial or pedicure in lieu of it next time. The biggest negative during the treatment was again, the MUSIC! I hated the music they played. It was weird and not relaxing at all...kind of like a combination of elevator music and new age trance or something. The only other minor issue is that the massage was scheduled for 60 minutes and the body polish was supposed to be a 45 minute treatment, but in total I was only in there for 90 minutes, so I'm not sure what happened to the extra 15 minutes.\n\nAll in all it was a good experience. I would come back for their specials, and would rank this on the higher end of resort spas."	2
This is a good place here in Vegas.  They menu is limited, but the food is very good.  They just started a Sunday Brunch which we happened to catch and they have some kinks to work out in getting organized for this, so for this review, I will say it was average.  \n\nI ordered eggs over medium and they were well done, the steak was overcooked as well.  The hash browns, looked like mine I make at home (this is NOT a compliment).  For the food they serve and what we have had in the past at this place, I expected a LOT better then what we received.\n\nNormally I would give this place 5 stars, but on this visit, 3 is pushing it.  Now, if they can get a better system in place for the Sunday Brunch and a better cook who does not over cook the food, then they will have a winning combination on Sunday's.\n\nI will give this place some time and try the Sunday Brunch again as like I said before, we have been to this place a few times since reopening and we do like the food and the experiences we had in the past and I believe this does deserve another chance.  \n\nOh yes, if you like mimosa's and bloody mary's, during Sunday Brunch it is all you can drink for $10.00, so that alone should be an incentive to get you in if you like those drinks.  We would return and this is a place we would recommend so you can be the judge and jury to base your experience on return or not. For now, Sunday Brunch, one more chance will be given.	2
The hot dogs there are good, not the greatest, but I like the different toppings and types of hot dogs they have. This wouldn't be a place I have to go to every time I'm in Vegas, but would definitely go if I wanted something quick and easy. The service was nice, quick, and friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, it was really windy the day we went so we had to stand inside at a very small counter. It's pretty small inside. I wish there were more inside seating. There is plenty of outside patio seating if the weather was nice enough.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Vegas Strip Dog\n-The Showgirl Dog\n-Mushroom Swiss Dog	2
Comfy couches & low lighting really had me excited as we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary.  The music was okay but as soon as we ordered with a groupon for two Headhunter drinks the server couldn't be bothered.  Even though we had planned to order more we couldn't even get her attention to get a bill which we would have at least give her a tip.  I read the other reviews and had great expectations - maybe we should have sat inside where we could have tried various drinks.	2
I can tell this place is managed well.  \n\nThe food & service was good.  It just wasn't my thing.	2
First visit to Xinh Xinh today for lunch.  I ordered the rice vermicelli with chicken and peanut and a spring roll. Food was delicious but the service left something to be desired.  We had to wait quite awhile for someone to take our order, and no one ever came to ask how everything was or to refill our drinks.  I wish I had ordered an appetizer or side dish because, while what I had was delicious, it was not quite filling.  I will be back again when I am in the mood for good Vietnamese food.	2
Spinning and eating are not normally things I do together... Nor do I ever want to do it again. The only time I spin is after a heavy night of drinking ... And we all know how fun that is.\n\nSo the shtick of this place is this: it's a restaurant on a relatively tall building in downtown Phoenix that spins, thus giving you a 360 degree view of the area around the hotel. \n\nBut it spins just a tad too fast. You can hear and feel the gears of the place going, oftentimes creaking in certain areas. The central wall is painted one boring color of baby-crap brown and there's nothing on it but a hand rail (really?!) that looks like a relic from the 70s.\n\nAnd it was freezing! Uncomfortable so. \n\nThe food was good. I had the salmon entree and it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked and a large portion. The appetizer was a pain in the ass. It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty, but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings, but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small. And there ain't no way I'm dropping oily mushrooms on this dress I'm wearing. I gave it up after the first slice. \n\nOverall, a weird experience. The place was practically empty on a Friday night and because the room is curved you can hear mystery voices of people you can't see... Can they hear me?!\n\nEven though I liked the dinner... I won't be back. Spinning around twice was enough for me.\n\nFYI- one rotation is almost exactly an hour long. And Arizona is damn boring more than once.	2
This place is cool to go to if you have some down time in vegas and you don't want to go to a casino. You'll find a lot o character t-shirts and memorabilia from Disneyland . I like to go here to look for grumpy shirts for my mom and to see if maybe they have any of the disney antenna toppers. The prices are a little cheaper than the disney store, though sometimes it's hard to tell.  If you're every in need of some disney stuff at a decent price, skip the disney store and come here first!	2
Believe it or not, this was my first time.\n\nThe place is nice, the service kind of hit and miss and the food pretty average. \n\nGood thing they have a vast selection of sauces so there are options as long as you like wings.\n\nNothing impressive but a fair place to have a quick bite.\n\nTuesday and Thursday they have wing specials.\n\nEnjoy	2
I needed to kill some time before catching a flight back home and Memphis BBQ is conveniently near the McCcarran airport car rental facility. \n\nMy order the combo lunch with baby back ribs, hot links, Mac and cheese, baked beans and a diet Pepsi.  Overall the food was just OK. The stand out was the baked beans - delish flavor with several types of beans made this a stand out. The ribs were just average - dry and flavor less. I had to add BBQ sauce to make em edible. Links were just eh and the Mac and cheese was flat!\n\nWhat was solid here was the service from my waitress Carrie. Very accommodating and whe made sure everything was good throughout my entire lunch. For her efforts I raised the overall rating of this review.\n\nWill I return here? Possibly but I'll try different items next time.	2
Wow, I guess I'm the first to weigh in on this place. This place was recommended by a local friend for a nice steak house for locals. He was so right on. This place is a little old school with steaks, seafood and sides that do not require one take out a mortgage to cover the check. Must be me (or the economy), but I am getting tired of paying $60 for an ala carte steak in Vegas. Anyway, the filet was stellar. My husbands giant rib eye with perfect and the service and cocktails were great. Quiet, peaceful retreat from the busy casino and an all around good restaurant and steakhouse. Decor not dazzling like some of the higher end steakhouses, but still enjoyed the painted panoramas that constantly changed with the lighting and the soft cushy booth under my behind.	3
Best wings you will find in Mesa! The wings are always so fresh and so hot! The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5  is because they need to work on their customer service. The girls who used to work the drivethru were rude at times, but this new girl they have is great, she remembers my order every time I pull up to the drive thru ha ha, goes to show how often I am there! Also, if you are short on time, I recommend that you call ahead. The drivethru process can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes, not good when you want something quick! Overall, you should definitely visit!	3
This is typically the Walmart location I end up at based on convenience. \n\nThe service is typically good and the lines can be busy on weekends during peak times, but for the most part, the store keeps their lines to a minimum by opening more registers when they are busiest. This is especially helpful during he holidays. I recently noticed the signs at the registers saying they will open a new register any time there are more than three people in the line waiting.\n\nThey keep a good amount of stock on the shelves and they are clean and organized as well.	3
Good food, competent staff.  Omelets made with egg whites so a little healthier then most.	3
When craving any type of mexican seafood, this is the place to go. Their 'botana negra' is delicious!! Also, their preparadas are bomb!	3
I forgot to ask who Kiyoshi was!  All I know is that it is a common Japanese boy's name.  Tonkatsu on the other hand (which I often confuse with Tonkotsu) is deep fried panko-breaded pork cutlet.  Just like breaded pork chop, Japanese style. When you enter the place, it looks very Japanese with the set-up and d\u00e9cor, but there was summer-y Hawaiian music playing in the background.  The place is tiny and I'm glad we went at an odd hour.\n\nIf we came more hungry, I would've wanted to try their beef tataki and daily special off menu agedashi tofu.  But today, we went straight to the entrees.  We had... \n\n1. The miso soup which came with both our orders.  This was awesome, definitely a notch above your standard bowls in Jap restaurants.  \n\n2. The Katsu Curry which has 2 pork cutlets, lots of rice, lots of curry with chunks of potato and carrot.  Their katsu preparation is good - thick cuts that maintain their juiciness with breading that is light and not greasy.  Their curry sauce has much stronger flavors than your typical Japanese curry, in fact, it really reminded me of the Indian version.  Hubby enjoyed it.\n\n3. The Katsudon (Katsu donburi) has katsu over rice topped with egg and katsudon sauce (which is a savory-sweet sauce).  There were a couple of grilled shishito peppers on the side as well.  The katsu itself is not salty and is meant to be dipped in curry or tonkatsu sauce so I wish this thin type sauce was tastier.  It was, however, still very good. \n\n4. Chicken Karaage for the lil man.  This was a very different preparation from the karaages in ramen joints.  The batter is not as light and the piece of chicken is denser.  Although good, I prefer the ramen joint version a lot better. \n\n5. Japanese potato salad.  This is a sweeter version of a classic with eggs and cucumbers.  A refreshing side to cut the fried goodness.\n\n6. Melon soda.  It comes in a bottle and I didn't care for this too much because it has a Yakult after taste.  But hubby loved it so much he asked for one to go.  Try it if you haven't had any melon soda yet.\n\n7. Their tonkatsu dipping sauce.  I love places that serve condiments.  I really do.  Each table comes with sauce and roasted sesame seeds which you grind yourself with a wooden pestle.  The tonkatsu sauce tastes like the Bulldog bottles you buy in Jap grocery stores.  If you haven't had this condiment, you might really love it or find it weird because it is slightly sour.  Kinda like catsup meets soy sauce meets sugar meets Worcestershire sauce.  I like it though.  And normally, I don't care much for sesame seeds but man!  The roasted sesame flakes on this tonkatsu sauce really elevates it to another level.  Real good stuff.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal a lot, and service rocked.  However, for the 2 entrees, 2 sides and 4 drinks, our bill was already over $50 with tip.  It's not cheap, and I wish it was so I can keep coming back.  But if you are a fan of fried Japanese goodness, then you might end up being a Kiyoshi groupie.	3
Spinach Tortellini with alfredo sauce was quite delicious, as well as the Four Cheese Pizza.  Cheese on this pizza was quite thick, almost a chore to cut and serve with the spatula.  Crust is golden, chewy overall, and rather medium in thickness.\n\nClean & new place with newer furniture, and plenty of round tables.  Server was prompt and polite, and was helpful with menu selections.  Prices were fair.\n\nI wish the tables were bigger.  The little round ones are simply inadequate for 4 people, and really the pizza should be served on one of those elevated pizza holders.  There's just no room.  Draft selection was poor as well with Anheuser-Busch/InBev products only.\n\nNice quiet lunch spot on weekdays.	3
While there's no shortage of NAPA locations in the East Valley, this is probably my favorite. They've got friendly, knowledgeable staff and easily the best selection of in-stock products of all the locations.\n\nThey're also open generous hours on Sunday, making this location one of the few NAPAs where you can get parts and advice seven days a week.	3
Beautiful salon with a wonderful owner who made planning a fun Bachelorette celebration really easy and enjoyable. For a reasonable cost per person, we were able to close the salon to just our private party of seven where three stylists got to work while we had champagne and crudite all ready and set up for us to enjoy. (They even decorated with some special Bachelorette signs and balloons).\nThe bride-to-be loved it all and while the degree of everyone's satisfaction with the actual blowouts/styles were all over the spectrum, the overall experience was really nice.	3
Love this location, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and I am always very pleasantly surprised at my total when I'm being rung up.\n\nThe only negative is that they cut it really really close with their expiration dates.  I can see the value in not throwing away food, but no one wants something that expires that day or the next day, especially when I'm shopping for the week.  I've even found things that have already expired on the shelves. I try to shop on Mondays or Tuesdays because that's when they seem to refresh their stocks but they could really work on not having expired/close to expired food on the shelves.\n\nOverall though, great store!	3
Pork was well seasoned and marinated. \nPresentation was good and taste was good.\nPrices where great and the quantity could have been more.\nService was polite and quick.	3
For a bagel shop in the desert, it doesn't get much better.  Great selection of fresh bagels (I love the Salt w/ lox).  \n\nThe service is quick and friendly, and the decor has local flavor you wont find at any big chain.  The owners really turned this place around about 4 years ago.  Now it is a thriving local hangout for the active adult in Ahwatukee.  In fact, they attract so many road bikers, a bike shop opened next door last year.	3
Really, really, neat! We brought our 9 year old son and he enjoyed it, too. It was awesome how you can see everything and nothing is hidden behind glass. Literally, you could touch the bodies! (But don't... Lol). Only reason why I didn't give it five stars was due to price. We are locals and I had a coupon and I still paid almost $90 for the 3 of us. They should really let children be admitted for free because although it is interesting, they don't really find much enjoyment from it like adults do. The whole exhibit takes about an hour and when we went it was uncrowded. Fantastic exhibit overall and I am glad I got to experience it!	3
Parking is tough, the food selection is great, and if you call ahead they will set aside awesome moving boxes for you.	3
Super fast and super friendly!  Whenever I'm craving some good take-out Chinese food, this is the place to go.  They have great prices and you get a decent amount of food for the money.  The owners are very personable, he even brought each of my kids a toy when delivering to my house once.  We've tried other Chinese food places in the Surprise area, and have found Chen & Wok to be one of the best.	3
zowie bowie really knows how to get the crowd goin and they sound awesome!!!\n\nprops to 'em!	3
I have died and gone to shawarma heaven! The chicken shawarma plate is probably in my top 3 all time favorite meals. The chicken is bursting with flavor, the hummus is amazingly creamy, the rice is perfect...I could go on and on! \n\nThe owner of Shawarma King is very nice, as well. Prices are great for the sheer amount of quality, delicious food you get.\n\nIf you are in the 43rd and Cactus area, you NEED to stop by. \n\nI would give 10 stars if possible!	4
"It's always a treat to visit Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails, whether you're feasting on innovative creations by Chef Stephen Jones, who pours love into every dish, or sipping on one of the delicious handcrafted cocktails for happy hour. I was invited to try some of the newest offerings on Jones' current spring/summer menu, made with organic and locally sourced ingredients that perfectly complement each other for a symphony in your mouth.\n\nThis meal (thank you to J. Lauren PR for the invitation), my pal Elle and I grabbed a seat outside on the patio, overlooking CityScape in downtown Phoenix.\n\nNot only was the weather perfect, we could hear tunes from neighboring Copper Blues. Like Elle pointed out, the music was great because it provided great background melodies that allowed us to still hear what each other was saying.\n\nLike all my visits at Blue Hound, the service, from the hostess to every single server who visited our table (including the knowledgeable and friendly Justis), was top-notch. Kudos to Blue Hound for properly training their staff in menu proficiency and professionalism.\n\nWe started with two delicious drinks - the Singapore Sling ($10) was made with Arizona Distilling Co. gin, B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and Cherry Heering liqueur. Justis told us the drink is modeled after original Tiki drinks, and we both agreed the balance of sweet and sour was great\n\nI also got the Lost Melody ($10), a frothy concoction with Smirnoff vodka, grapefruit liquer, coconut cream, grapefruit juice, and rose flower water. It tasted like dessert in a drink, which was totally fine with me, and I loved inhaling the coconut scents with every tasty sip.\n\nMy pal and I split a ton of plates, perfectly portioned for sharing, during our feast. First up was the Cured Strawberry and Fennel Flatbread ($14), with pickeled fennel (a favorite ingredient of Chef Jones - read my Phoenix People interview with him here), pistachio, wild baby arugula and ricotta cheese. I've never had strawberries on a pizza, but let me tell you, the flatbread was delicious and tasted just like what you'd think of when it comes to spring.\n\nWe also dug into the Avocado salad ($9), with blood oranges, grapefruit and wild greens. Elle described it perfectly as \""chic diet food,'\"" a light and fresh salad you could feel good eating right before a night out or before getting into a swimsuit, since it was healthy and light. I loved the fruit and avocado combination and gobbled up every bite.\n\nElle loved the Tater Tots she ordered (a small portion at $7), which had bacon and chive made right in the tots. \""These are every college kid's wet dream,\"" she said, noting the bacon baked in was a spectacular touch.\n\nWe both enjoyed the Corn Bread Panzanella ($9), a bread salad with artichoke, fava beans, baby leeks, and peas mixed with an herb vinaigrette. It was really filing and would be a great appetizer to share.\n\nSurprisingly, maybe our favorite savory dish was the Roasted Cauliflower ($9), really simple but oh-so-good because, like most of Blue Hound's offerings, it combined sweet, savory and salty to satisfy all your palate's tastes. It came with pistachios, capers and currants, and Justis said it's simply cooked by poaching the cruciferous vegetable in milk before charring it a little in a skillet, then adding in the capers, currants and a touch of butter and herbs.\n\nElle summed up the meal perfectly: \""I would never have thought of putting this stuff together, but it's exactly what I want,\"" she said.\n\nI was full, but we asked Justis to surprise us with dessert. He brought out the latest dessert menu item, the BHPB&J ($9), a twist on PB&J with whoopie pie, blackberry jelly ice cream, peanut butter mousse (OMG, so good), and fresh berries. The chocolate covering the whooiee pie was so decadent, and I loved all the flavors on the updated classic. \""It tastes like the Fourth of July,\"" Elle added, saying it reminded her of all-American flavors from the summer holiday.\n\nWe were stuffed, but then were surprised with dessert number two: Pineapple Upside-Down Cake served skillet-style ($9), wish medjool date ice cream atop salted caramel.\n\nWe devoured every bite despite our full bellies, and every serving was a winner for these two ladies.\n\nWhile most of what we ordered was vegetarian, Blue Hound's latest menu has some notable seafood items, including Crispy Salt N' Pepper Shrimp, Grilled Yellowfin Tuna and Red Snapper."	4
I've been coming here for almost 4 years. The customer service has always been on point! I really like the simplicity, the atmosphere, and how quickly everything happens. An easy five stars from me.	4
This place is off the chain! Food, service, atmosphere and speed of service are all top-notch. Kathy (our server) and Shawn (our greeter) showed great personalities and kept us smiling... in fact, everyone in the place was smiling. I'm adding Mr. Mama's to my list of regular Vegas stops!	4
I have eaten here 5x now with in a 2 month period.  The Bleu Cheese burger and their Ranch Burger are the ABSOLUTE BEST burgers I have ever had in my life!!! ... I was recommended the Salmon Salad if I wanted a hearty but light salad, all I can say is AMAAAZZZINGGGG!!! WOW...and the staFF is wonderful, very gracious and attentive...excellent service and above all a great experience all around...	4
The steaks are so succulent, licks lips. Took my love her for his birthday dinner, well worth every dollar.	4
Water wings is great place to get your kids ready for the pools in town.   They are all very friendly and with as many kids that go there they always seem to remember each one individually which is always a welcome thing at any business. \n\nThe instructors are really great with the kids, especially the younger ones. With crying babies and children afraid of the water, the teachers all seem to have a great calm and patience about them and work through the tantrums until the child is having a blast in the pool. \n\nThey have showers to rinse off afterward and a play room for the siblings who might not be taking swim classes too. \n\nThey do parties and I'm pretty sure they have some kind of daycamp thing although my daughter is too young for that. \n\nWe love it there!	4
The food was great and they provided me excellent service. A side note is that i had the mionas special chicken and general yan chicken. Super tasty and price is right for the lunch combo.	4
One of my all time favorite places.  The Lasagana is awesome!	4
Friendly service and the coffee is always great! There drive-thru line gets pretty long but so does every other Starbucks I have been too. Great location right next to the freeway.	4
Love this place. Absolute gem of a spot. Intimate with a very chill vibe. So glad I was able to find it. It did take a while for me to pull my crap together to figure out how to make a reservation but once I did it was easy peasy. \nThe mixologist is great. I love that they come out, introduce themselves and mix a drink based on your desire, even when what you want is not on their menu. It was a great experience that I will definitely have again in the near future.	4
"Their food is great! The ambiance is superbly friendly and the weekly Wednesday night \""MPG Jazz Jam\"" is 21st century's doorway to Jazz heaven!! sincerely Dr Bruce from PittsburghJAM.org"	4
I knew this place would be good, because I have been to Akira Back's restaurant Yellowtail before.  I wasn't disappointed.  The Crispy Rice appetizer with the Blackened Tuna was really good.  I also had the Pop Rockin Roll and Blue Fin.  The Sushi was really good.  But the thing that was over the top fantastic was the Toban Filet.  It is served in a hot bowl with Mushrooms and Broth.  It is to die for good!  It was on the rare side and just melted in your mouth.  I would go back just for that.  The dessert was really good as well.  A little spendy, but I don't mind if the food is good and it was!  The service and decor are also great.  We will definitely be going back to Kumi!!	4
Very similar to the Beverly Hills one. Except in Vegas, they have a crazy ribeye and the interior is more modern and newly built with less personality. I prefer the old school charm of the Beverly Hills location. \nDelicious warm sourdough bread, refreshing spinning salad with Lawry's seasoned pepper and cold forks, huge baked potatoes with the works, juicy prime-rib with a lot of horseradish, a double order of creamed corn and spinach on the side, and fluffy Yorkshire pudding to soak up the bloody au jus!\nOne of the best meals on the planet!!	4
Living down in Sierra vista 2 years killed me knowing that there is a few yard houses couple hundred miles north. \n\nThey have the BOMBEST onion rings than any other place I've been to! I think there batter is laced with crack. I can eat a entire tower by myself there that good. Though I wouldn't recommend it since your stomach won't like you if you start pounding down all that beer they have with it.\n\nFood there is on the high side but it's worth it. Havnt ordered anything that didn't taste like it came out of a freezer bag. You wont be disappointed. \n\nEvery time I come here I always start with there sampler pack which consists of 6 beers they choose for the month. Your bound to find something that you will like. \n\nSeriously don't come here and order a bud light or a corona. I mean really im sure there are people that just won't try anything new but really though... There will be something you will love just as much if not even better than your pre existing favorite. \n\nThere is usually a tall guy with a beard working the bar every time I come here. He has been here since it opened ad he will find something to quench your thirst :)\n\nIf your like me and have a few to many of those half yards and feel like you may have had a few to much. Dont be a dummy and drive off so the scottsdale PD can give you a DUI. Big no no! then just go walk it off in the fashion square mall.	4
"I have been a customer for 4 months. I shopped around and after lots of calls and conversations, hired Dori's.  Christian and Amber own the company and do all the work.  They saved me from a HUGE algae stain in a brand new 20,000 gallon in-ground pool! Stupidly I thought I could take care of it-NOT!!! They came and in two weeks got the problem solved! Saved my butt!  They are extremely knowledgable both about water chemistry and pump/filter systems. They can fix anything and solve any problem.  They are honest, and care about their work.  They are very nice and will respond immediately to any \""pool crisis\""!  All of this for the most reasonable price around. They come every week and my pool is beautiful! By the way, Christian is a former US Marine and has served in the Gulf War. He is an American Hero! Needless to say, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Dori's Pool Service!."	4

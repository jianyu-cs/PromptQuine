I contested the charge with my bank and so far... was able to get this removed. I never got a call back from the corporate office. And when I called the actual location again they told me that I would need to bring in my personal bank statement to prove they charged me again. Very shoddy customer service. It really is a shame because I like the subs and the service they provide. But unfortunately, I will never be visiting a Silvermine subs again.	0
CVS' Minute Clinic should be renamed. I have found it to be significantly less convenient than making an appointment with my doctor. Due to my employer's requirement to get a wellness screening for insurance purposes, I have found myself signing in to the minute clinic on 5 separate occasions. Each sign in requires enough info that it takes 5 minutes just to sign in. Only then are you informed how long the wait will be.  I have tried 2 different CVSs at varying times throughout the day (from 8 am to 4 pm) and the wait has never been less than 2 hrs. \n\nIf you have the option to go elsewhere, save yourself the headache of eternal wait times and do so.	0
The female Jersey shore look alike bartender on Fridays is for sure snorting something, and watch out for her to scratch her crouch before pouring your drink.	0
Horrible customer service!  Honestly my worst online experience ever!  Their pictures don't match the product you receive and then charge you a ridiculously high restocking fee to return.  There are plenty of other better companies to choose.  Save your time and money with this one	0
This has got to be the dirtiest place I've been. The staff is run horribly. The trash is over flowing behind the counter and the PM special for $5 is horrible. The staff was all wearing dirty shirts. My wife and I will not be coming back.	0
Horrible customer service.  In new towers 2 of 3 elevators didn't work.  Old towers run down.  NEEDS WORK	0
I thought this was going to be unbelievable food boy was I disappointed.  It taste like someone opened a can of Chef Boyardee/	0
First impression. Rude service. Waitress took order across table. Waitress also did not take responsibility for order. Said she didn't know since someone else took order. Waitress name Geo. Fish was stringy. Only good thing about this place is price...but then again, I guess you get what you pay for...definitely will not return.	0
"Terrible.  Overpriced and the food is close to inedible.  The \""eggs benedict\"" were a runny mess smeared on my plate. Noodles were gross.  All the food was flat and shapeless.\n\nIt probably didn't help that I stood 30 mins in line for no apparent reason since there were plenty of empty tables in the place."	0
Is it possible to give a -5 star rating? If it were, I would give it to this location! \nThis is the worst, worst, worst Panera Bread I have ever been to. \n\nWhy do I continue to go there you may ask... because it is so close to my house, I have limited options as a vegetarian on the go, and apparently I am a glutton for punishment. \n\nI have spoken with three different managers regarding the issues I've had with my meals, and nothing ever seems to change.\n\nI can finally say that I will not be going back, au revoir!	0
Guess JITB is afraid of what people will say of the one they have on  West Blvd.\nWent to the one on West Blvd about a week ago , have not been in about 6 or 8 months, see thing never change, gangsta wannabes hanging out in dining area, management seems not to care, or are they intimadated by the GWB's Food was cold and greasy.....This time I will stay away......	0
This is probably the most overrated buffet in Vegas. I heard good things about this place when they first opened, but when I visited a week ago for dinner, it was overcrowded with very long lines on the meat and seafood stations. I had to wait more than 15 minutes on the seafood station line! And for what?! Crab legs that were overcooked and oysters that smelled like women's makeup! The meat station was little better but it did not make up for other shortcomings.	0
To be honest with you...... As a previous installer at Arizona sound.. These people care nothing about their customers it is simply sell what they can to whoever they can they will sell to you what you do not need just to make some extra money and talk in their installers into installing it as fast as possible. whether fitment is correct or not.. Customers come in spending thousands of dollars only to return within a few days with the garbage product.... The moral of the story is they sell used for new price and even when you're not paying attention they install other stuff than what you would actually purchased and try to explain to you they're not trying to screw you over	0
Since KoMex was closed until 27 Dec for the holidays, my buddy and I went went to Macayo for a real sit-down Mexican restaurant (instead of a fast food Mexican joint).  Big mistake as the kitchen took forever to prepare our food on account of the large group that was in the back room.  \n\nThe chips & salsa was ok, my taco, tamale, enchilada combo was ok.  Our server Melanie was nice, but I don't plan on going back to Macayo.  I'll wait until KoMex is open again or just opt for a fast food Mexican joint.	0
I WILL NOT eat here ever again!!! I used to love this place great specials, delivery and good chinese food. The last and final time I ordered from here I got my delivery order and found a handful of baby roaches in my chow mein, that was 3 years ago. I have not eaten here since and I never will return	0
Very poor show. You would expect arial acts, wonderful correography, and a better Cirque spectacular. The acts were poor, the costumes were outdated and just because some people showed their tits does not make it. We have seen most all of the Cirque shows as well as La Reve. Zumanity does not even belong in the same category. Don't waste your money? Did the dinner package a Gallaghers and that was a total rip off.$60.00 per person without drinks. It did include gratuity.	0
Horrendous! I can honestly say that NOTHING we ordered was tasty...rib eye was alright. But for the price, this place is a huge ripoff. $75 veal chop should be as tender as BUTTER...the veal was tough, and had a weird aftertaste. Pastas...all blah...salads...meh (think maria's italian kitchen) it was so bad that no one in our party of 10+ wanted to order dessert!  With the plethora of nice, expensive steakhouses, spend your money elsewhere in Vegas. SW steakhouse at the Wynn is very good!	0
Management reorg needed ASAP! This place would be so much better if someone that worked there actually took pride in their job. Over priced food that was just okay tasting. Ordered a piece of party it's like your birthday cake for dessert, it had finger prints of the person that cut it then grabbed it with his/her hand and placed it on the plate. I should've read the other reviews before wasting $75. The table next to us sent back a plate as well, not at all what we expected. Very disappointed. I've worked in the restaurant business and most horrible restaurants are due to poor management... Not coming back here again.	0
The beers were warm and flat.  The bartender was argumentative when we told him about it.  6 employees working on a Sunday afternoon and I still had to get up and go to the bar to get napkins for my wings since none were brought to me with them.  The place is cold and not inviting at all.  We won't be back.	0
Lack of Atmosphere (Even during sporting events)\n\nFood is terrible.\n\nBartender/Waitress were incredibly rude....\n\nEverybody has bad days, they should not be this bad.....	0
3 stars for the food and -2 for the service. They have pathetic service and a shameless staff.	0
Awful.  Got there late to our group.   Wouldn't serve us food, even an appetizer!   Our check took an hour, could have easily served us a small plate.  Crazy!!   I eat out at least five days a week, so this was nuts!!!	0
The food was great, but the customer service was terrible. I got charged twice for my order (first $37, second being $31) and they showed up at my door the next day with the same food. I don't know why my order or credit info was saved twice, but accidents happen. They took the food back but didn't take away the second charge. I called and talked to the manager and he blew me off saying he would look into it and call me back and I never heard from him again even calling back again and again. Extremely disappointing for such a good pizza place to have ripped me off like that.	0
This place closed permanently in Dec 2011. They are replacing it with a bunch of condos. Probably for the best, it had seen better days.	0
only gets one star because service was horrible. Food is fairly good. I walked in with my husband and sat at the bar. We were there for late night and we were asked by the guy bartender to move to the corner if we weren't drinking. I wanted to leave right away like who does that? Then he sat 2 girls in our spot and they didnt even have a drink!! none the less he completely ignored us and I swore I would not return to this place	0
Food poisoning my first time (and now last) eating here. Stay away if you value your health! One star only because yelp doesn't allow you zero.	0
"Very disappointing. We made a reservation for 12 of us at 7:00pm on a Friday night. The atmosphere and bull riding is the highlight of this place. Our waitress tried very hard, but after 2 hours we still did not have our food? We ordered chicken fingers and onion rings, really 2 hours. After the first hour they put the order back through and said it should come right out, after another hour we finally asked the manager what was going on and his response was \""sorry\"" these things happen. No comp on anything. We then went over to Buffalo Chip and had our food in 15 minutes. Will not be back and will let all of our local friends know."	0
This review is purely for the late night dining. We ordered take out here one night and the wait for 2 simple orders was about 30-40 minutes. Then we decided to give them a chance to redeem themselves and ordered the very next night. The wait was AGAIN about 30-40 minutes, but for ONE order. It wasn't even busy. There is no reason food, TAKE OUT FOOD, should take that long to prepare. The food itself was OK, but the reason I will never be back for late night take out ordering will be the wait time. \n\nAbsolutely, inexcusably ridiculous.	0
They scratched my car. A big one and my bad that I didn't notice it while picking up the car. What more I have to say?	0
Waited 40 minutes with no apologies or explanation. So obnoxious.  Walked out and will NEVER return. There are far too many other restaurants in town with stellar service that we will choose to spend our money.	0
Sweet and sour chicken was horrible. We will never come back here again. Not authentic Asian food at all. Very disappointed. Not worth my $$ at all!!	0
The one bouncer refused to let me in because I was wearing sneakers.  I had on nice jeans and a nice polo shirt and was dressed better than 90% of the guys in there.  I was also with three women and was their DD.  They still wouldn't let me in when we told them that.  I eventually snuck in even though I didn't want to go.  It was my friend's birthday and that is the only reason I went.  I'll never go back to a place who won't let in a DD.	0
"Horrible service. Waiting for almost 3 hours just to get discharged. I don\""t understand why they are included.in the 100 best hospitals. Please re review."	0
I was so disappointed by my dinner here!!! I had a chicken dish that tasted really bad.  The sauce was runny and had an odd flavor. Everyone in our party agreed that the food just wasn't good! It's quite pricey too. I will NOT be returning.  I feel bad for them because a lot of restaurants go out of business on Market Street.  They really need some help here!	0
Bad service and waitresses unable to do math.  Manager and owner unresponsive to all emails and complaints	0
What a waste of my last day of vacation. The lady doing my pedicure didn't cut my cuticles and when I asked her to, she did it dry so my skin was rough. Then when I asked her to make sure that the bottom was smooth, she said she did enough. She calls someone else over who says that they don't take off too much skin or my feet will bleed...my feet get done regularly, by the way. Yes, my feet will probably bleed from the brutal cuticle cutting I received. Guess I'll be getting another pedicure when I get home. Can't believe this place actually has good reviews.	0
Have you watched Magic Mike? Well this is exactly like that, in the sense that there is not enough stripping and way too much dancing. \n\nThere has to be much more shaking the booty in a thong. \n\nThere was one guy who shook his booty a lot but he was kinda older... aka not really eye candy.\n\nI guess if you want to go to a male dance show, this will fit your needs, but if you're looking for something a little more raunchy, skip this show.\n\nIf a guy paid $50ish to see females doing what these guys did, the guys would riot.	0
You can pretty much copy-paste all the previous comments/reviews here too.  \n\nLazy service, under/mismanaged, dirty, poor products.  Unfortunate too, because they have the tools and opportunity to be a really, really neat niche.  The GC in Litchfield Park is WAY better.  C'mon Ground Control, get your managing act together!	0
They were shutdown due to too many health inspection demerits :(\n\nhttp://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Happys-Pizza-265623751.html?lc=Smart	0
Decent service awful management, I think my intestines died after trying to eat their overly greasy corned beef hash which took forever to even be brought out on a night which wasn't even busy. The skinny blonde manager acted like he didn't even want to deal with the issues I was having and was even a bit condescending. To compensate I got a 20% discount off of my bill, avoid this place and if you don't want to manage then do something that suits you better like McDonald's drive thru there are teenagers there with better tact.	0
Very watery Korma. The Naan had the texture of baked pizza dough. The only good thing was the tartness of the mango lassie. They were the previous owners of Samosa Factory,  but their food didn't seem to carry over. Samosa Factory has surpassed this place greatly.	1
I've been here a few times now and haven't really been able to find an entr\u00e9e that I would order again. Not much of it seems to have a fresh taste. The pizza is probably the best thing on the menu. \n\nThey always seem busy so maybe it's just me.	1
Something was wrong with the produce - burgers made me and my kid sick. Awesome milkshakes though. Fries were average. Good atmosphere and friendly service. Wish we ate somewhere else.	1
I wanted to like this place... but yuck. I could smell the old, nearly rotten oil when we walked in the door and I kept hoping I was maybe imaging it. We ordered to-go and when we got home, I couldn't eat the burger and the fries didn't taste good due to the bad oil. Only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the kids working there were really trying hard to impress and do a good job.	1
"Not impressed the food was over seasoned and even the patio was loud.Should cactus salad have cactus? Mine didn't.\n\nI have to lean towards Bill M's response. I think the name and location makes this a so called \""hip\""place to go. I just prefer to taste my food not have it covered up with \""a hint of lime\""which must have been a whole lime. Not real anxious to go back but who knows."	1
Asian dishes might be good but do not get the sushi. Made me sick! Will not go back here again.	1
This theatre was the only place we found showing a NY Philharmonic event (Company) and ah boy, did we get the worst theatre and projector.  The chairs hadn't been cleaned, the room was somewhere between small and tiny, and the worst part -- the projector had a scanline that went up and down the entire showing.  \n\nFor $18 I was expecting THX and HD projection, not to be kicked in the knee.  If it wasn't the only place in town to see it and if I'd known it was going to be that bad... ugh, this place.	1
I have given this place 2 stars and the reason is because of the service and speed of food. The food quality was great, fries was good but the wait for food and our server was awful. My gf stated that if our server would have smiled it would have been a miracle. Again the food was good.. The service was awful	1
Must have gone on an off night. Have heard good things about the pizza here, and really wanted to like it, but the pizza dough, sauce and (veggie) toppings were all completely bland and tasteless :(\nYMMV...	1
Southern Bell was the best but the cupcakes were kind of dry... Won't go back again. Cute but not very good, unfortunately.	1
They where incredibly excellent for awhile but now they seem to be falling more and more. Even the beer is warm now. Don't know what has happened.	1
I've been to the one at Desert Ridge twice now for breakfast.  Both times the waitstaff has messed up the order.  Its a simple order, side of Bacon.  The food is good, it's only eggs and toast, but the waitstaff is is slow, forgetful, can be rude and doesn't know the menu.  Both times the restaurant was not busy, so the wait staff wasn't slammed.  If you go, make sure you stay on top of the waitstaff or you won't get the correct order.	1
The food and service were great, but the music was so loud you couldn't talk without yelling, but it was a Saturday night, I can understand that. What really got to me though was the lanes were not properly waxed so you couldn't slide and it would seem the AC was broken. My friends and I kept going outside to cool down. Several of us asked for the AC to be turned down and we were told the AC was broken, which is horrible is Phoenix. Overall I'd go to party there, but as a bowling alley, I'd go somewhere else.	1
"This place keeps getting worse every time I visit. For starter's, their slices are overpriced, as are the entire pizzas. Secondly, I find the sauce too sweet. The empanadas are ok, nothing to write home about. \n\nFinally, every time I've been here, the service has been bizarre. It seems like the staff is high. They aren't necessarily rude, just clueless. Also, they like to change the rules on their \""deals\"", which I personally find annoying. Also, they often have buddies hanging out which makes the cramped space even smaller. The only reason I go here occasionally is  because it's near my building."	1
A beer while you wait us cool, but getting 3-4 strips of steak and 1 cheese crisp sized tortilla is very disappointing when ordering a fajita meal. Honestly could've got more at Taco Bell. I don't know why I didn't remember my last bad experience there. Ugh!	1
I've eaten here a few times just hoping to get something amazing since it has such awesome reviews and it's always busy. The food is good but not great. The service is ok, not great.	1
The combos were over priced as in are we in a foreign country which devalues the American Dollar? Oh no, we are in Vegas, and an airport nonetheless. The fries were fresh but tasteless cafeteria style and the dining areas were filthy.Burger was pretty standard.	1
This place reminds me of Santana row in that it has a very high price due to locale and stigma, but ultimately has mediocre taste.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients could have been better.\nThe chai we ordered was way too sweet, and as far as taste, you could get that a drive thru for $2.\n\nNice presentation, though.\n\nI had a double espresso that had a really weird taste that was acidic.\n\nThe Dulce De Leche Croissant, Apple Cauchon and the Eclair were  A-OK.	1
The ambience and servers are awesome but other than the avocado roll I wouldn't recommend going for actual sushi. I love sushi and wasn't expecting an amazing sushi experience from a chain but it really disappointed us. \n\nThe miso soup was very salty and fishy. The chile yellowtail dish was just -not okay-, tuna roll-okay, yellow tail nagiri-okay, and the vegetarian roll was really really  rough on the tongue from the green rice paper. We didn't order anything more. \n\nIt also takes a really really long time to get any sushi rolls. The miso soup and edamame come out quickly but that's all.	1
This is a great place to see a movie. But try getting your soda and popcorn in a timely manner. forget it! One person selling tickets. Two people taking tickets. One person at concession. With a line of 8 to 10 people! Manager must be sleeping in the back. Get your act together!	1
It was very anticlimactic to visit the pawn shop.  It was basically just a big tourist spot with everyone taking pictures and buying Chumlee T-shirts.  We only got to hang out here for 5 minutes before they closed it to film, and they kick everyone out.  When we left all these cab drivers bugged us to see if we needed rides.  If you are a die hard fan and want a t shirt maybe it's worth a stop, otherwise just drive by and take a picture of the outside.	1
we went yesterday, Friday to check it out. #1 they moved down the street, no sign on the previous address to inform customers. Went to new address. Lady behind the counter never acknowledged our presents. Never said a word to us, I really don't think she even looked at us. I thought the items were ordinary and over priced. I found a sun dress that I own on one of the racks and it was priced $5.00 more than I bought it new.To me not worth a second look.	1
Warhol was still able to elicit $30 from me, 24 years after his death.  But his museum barely elicited 20 minutes of my time or any reaction whatsoever.   Possibly relevant before the onset of computers and specifically Photoshop, his work is now religated the scrap heap of pre-cursor also rans.  Interestingly enough the piece we found most intriguing was Keith Haring's elephant.   While the Warhol museum is certainly a must see destination for tourists, anyone looking for inspiring art might be better served elsewhere.  Oh yeah, kudos to Ritchie Hawtin's doppelganger at the front desk...you guys killed it in Miami that one time.	1
We were really disappointed in this place.  \n\nI made a rez for the first night my girls and I were in town. The service was spotty and the sushi was meh.  \n\nThat's all I really have or want to say.  Pass and go somewhere else.  Especially if you're looking for good sushi - find another spot.	1
Pay to cook my food? What the? And it is quite the average variety.	1
My last visit here, one of the guys behind the counter smelled really bad. They put my sandwiches up on the counter but didn't say anything to anybody, AND they left their dust pan and broom propped up on the soda fountains. Maybe the boss was away that day or something.	1
Last minute Bloody Mary craving brought me and a girlfriend to Rao's one Saturday morning.   The line for the buffet was insanely long and Rao's empty tables were just what we needed.  Having eaten an incredible meal at Rao's in 2004 for a wedding reception at Caesar's I had high expectations but unfortunately something was amiss here.. \nOur Bloody Mary's were watery, my pizza boring, and my salad was meh.  I am sure if I had not gone on with incredible memories of a meal that happened nearly a decade ago I might have enjoyed it but this was a big disappointment.	1
Service was slow. Ordered a nonfat chai latte with shot of espresso, not too complicated. The chai was bitter due to the herbs not being strained out which also made it gritty- a very unpleasant texture in a drink. The only pluses about this place is the decor & patio. Didn't try any food but it looked good.	1
I want a jim and coke in pint glass....no we dont serve like that.....well wont come back ever. ..such not  a big deal....	1
blush is a cool place to hang out.. idk if it's a lounge. felt like it.. but with a club crowd? there's not enough places to chill and a million ppl walking around and around each other..   music was very typical vegas which isn't a favorite of mine but i deal.. and overall.. drinks f*'d me up... so maybe paying the price is worth it?   idk.. it's real pretty inside though..	1
"The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a \""night out\"" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.\n\nTwo stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers."	1
My husband went to the riders course at this location and was so disappointed and disgusted by how he was treated he didn't even go back for the last day of class. They overbooked the course with too many people and brought in an instructor from another location to assist. The other instructor was rude, repeatedly yelled at students, and contradicted what the resident instructor lady told them to do.  We spent $600 on the class and required gear.  The class was supposed to be a great time for my husband and a way to get more comfortable on a bike but turned into a total downer.	1
I am a little less than impressed with this one. No, the service is great, and it has good screenings like all the Odeon ones. It just lacks character and well, there aren't that many screenings of the blockbusters you want to see. Instead it focuses on one and shows far too many shows of it instead of spreading the weight a little. \n\nOn a road that has two independent cinemas up the street, this one falls fairly flat. But here you will find screenings of Sex and the City 2 and other rom coms and big buck movies,  unlike further up the street.	1
I don't get it, I remember the good ol TCBY frozen yogurt. Creamy and smooth, real flavors.  This stuff melts weird in your mouth and the flavors all taste artificial and the same in a weird way.  So over priced.  The only good thing was how nice they are, really good customer service.	1
Off strip casino, supposedly 'where the locals go' but the machines were tight so I think that's just an urban legend. Dirty and very very smoky. Sketchy clientele.	1
there ok	1
I was not please with this little donut shop they are pretty pricey. I got 5 donuts and half\nOf my donuts were not cook all the way they all had a very weird taste to them.	1
Old furniture, barely working faucets, and got charged $20 per day resort fee without any additional services. Even newspaper that part of the resort fee was never delivered.	1
I've had the tiramisu here before and it was fab.  But the last time I went, it was disgusting.  The texture was gloppy and gelatinous.  It reminded me of very nasty bodily excretions.\n\nFreakin' yuck.	1
I used to love it here. For years it was the best burger in town. But, I have to say the last couple times we've been here I've been really disappointed. The burger is BLAND now. I have to take this place off the list, too bad. Houston's/Hillstone burger has never disappointed, so we'll be going there from now on.	1
This place has the best Gyros and Pizza Puffs I've ever had.  Their menu is a little pricey and I have to say that I wasn't thrilled seeing the 1 refill note on the soda machine.\n\nNote to: JT Gyros if you read this I would suggest removing the sign from the machine and allow your customers free refills as you will lose customers with this since other places allow free refills.	2
Located inside Planet Hollywood, this is a pretty cool place to grab a drink. I came here to pregame every day of the week during my business trip. Mondays are Ladies' Night. My coworker got $1 drinks but mine were $9. fail. Wednesdays are $8 all you can drink wrist bands before midnight, only $5 for girls. They have a cool outdoor patio which overlooks the Strip and CityCenter's new Cosmopolitan. I'd go just to enjoy the view! The crowd is alright here, hit and miss. I did meet some cool, young nurses, and some wonderful ladies on business trips. Cool place. Go and tip my girl  Kaylee!	2
"I went to Bruegger's on my lunch break to try something new. \n\nI got a Herby Turkey on an everything bagel.  \n\nThey let you get the bagels \""skinny\"" style, where they cut out the middle of the bagel so it isn't so thick.  It wasn't bad necessarily, but for $6, I expected more.  \n\nI've been there for coffee in the morning as well and I was not a fan.\n\nOverall pretty decent food, even if it is overpriced."	2
"Last time I was there, the dog sitting at the bar really threw me. Before that, the dog that bit my brother (which was my brother's fault per the owner?) made me think of not coming back. Just needed a cigar today, and the girl behind the counter was pleasant, but the \""regulars\""/bar rats seemed to be taking up most of her attention."	2
Had dim sum sampler for 2, seaweed salad, BBQ pork noodle soup.\nIt was just a sponteneous lunch at Mandaley. \nPrice was not cheap either (we paid about $60).  Will go Chinatown next time.	2
Free with my room I made the all day buffet my bitch by eating my weight in crab legs... \n\n\nIt's not the Wynn buffett, but seriously, what is?  It also doesn't cost as much.  I wouldn't go out of your way to eat here, but if you get a deal and aren't expecting haute cuisine, it's not terrible.	2
I ordered a salad and that was good. My friend had the braised rib and it was yummy. Braised rib must be a common dish in this area as they have it on a few menus at the restaurants in the area. \n\nWe ordered a couple of desserts that were good. \n\nService was lacking. I know we were sitting in the bar area, but waited forever to order after we said we needed one more minute.	2
Its is a pretty building near lots of places to eat. However no one who works at city hall doesn't have a recommendation for anything! Lame! I was hoping for a spectacular place to eat at while in this neck of the woods.....disappointed. Oh well, on my own I shall venture	2
Vegas really doesn't have a good mall. This one is certainly easy to get to and has some staple stores (Dillards, Macys, Victoria's Secret, Etc) but is still not amazing. Its still easier then going to the Strip to got to Planet Hollywood, Fashion Show or Forum Shops... so points for that. Someone needs to spend some money and really pump up this mall because it has the potential to be more then just good.	2
"riddle me this? how does a mexican chicken shop have english speaking workers & right next door at jack-in-the-box no one can understand a word. the service is fast & friendly. very helpful & thorough. the atmosphere was nice-outdoor seating available.very clean. the food is good, a refreshing change from all the fried stuff. an unusual flavor of lime & smoke but good. a little pricey. but lots of coupons available. \nif you haven't tried it i would recommend it especially if you've had enough of the wannabe \""fried\"" chicken places"	2
Definitely did not enjoy this meal as much as I hoped to. I ordered a shrimp with risotto and it was lackluster in flavor and disappointing, especially for the price. For dessert we got a chocolate brownie dish with ice cream. It was also just ok...again, for the price I would have expected better.\n\nMy boyfriend got braised pork and it was also underwhelming. The meat was tough so his teeth ended up hurting from all the chewing. Service was decent but the price was high. Food is not terrible, but I think there are definitely better options in the area.	2
Their hotel is nice, but their shaving kit is a joke. Had to go out of my way and walk to Walgreen's to get something that even worked. My facial hair isn't even that coarse, but it took going over the same spot 10 times hoping the razor would eventually rip the hair out of your face, since the blades were too dull to cut anything. I gave up, and walked to Walgreen's with a patchy face. The cheapest two-blade plastic razor there was able to finish the job going over my face once.	2
I've been to the original location in the Strip since writing my Oakland review. It definitely is better overall than the Oakland shop (fries were better, and just tasted fresher), but still nothing too amazing. I think the concept of the sandwich just doesn't do it for me (See Oakland Primanti's review).	2
A perfectly serviceable and cozy option on the Royal Mile. It's inoffensive and the tourists will probably love it, as it's stacked with Scottish feeling. \n\nOne niggle is the seating, which I always feel there isn't enough of. The pub itself has a nice atmosphere, but the long galley style means that seating is stacked up against one side of the room and there's not really all that many spots to pull up a pew. \n\nHowever, it's a friendly little place, and location-wise is well oriented. Nice spot for a catch up with a friend.	2
This was the first and only Thai place I've been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we can't find anything better, I think we won't have any problem going back to Swaddee.\n\n*Price = on the high-end \n*Pad Thai = pretty good volume\n*Green Curry = very good.\n*Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11	2
Beautiful, beautiful bar. I absolutely adore the decor - very unique, very inviting, very cozy. \n\nThey have a great drink menu selection, especially for a tequila lover like myself. However, I did get the jalapeno margarita and it was soooo spicy (too spicy for me, and I usually enjoy spicy jalapeno drinks). Over the course of close to an hour I only had a few sips. The bartender even dropped by to give my friend (almost done with her drink) a free drink (with no explanation). I should have spoken up, but I will opt for a nice glass of wine to enjoy this space next time.	2
Wow, way overrated, but not really a bad place either.. I received so much HYPE about how GREAT this place was, and people went into the Diners Dives n Drive thru's, which for me was a selling point to try. Great concept though, a mix of 3 culture to quench most cravings. I got the Chinese BBQ Pork (Great) and the Jerk Chicken (fair) with the beans n rice... Rice was a tad undercooked, and the Jerk chicken lacked the JERK from other Caribbean food I have tried..	2
The food is good like you'd expect from In-N-Out.  The staff at this location is incompetent usually forgetting to put napkins or forks with the order.	2
I work in the 400 S Tryon Building. The food is good, nothing to get too excited about, pretty typical. Its great on a rainy day and I dont want to go outside. If you are looking for something fast just walk across the street to salsaritas. I usually wait a good 15 mins for my check.\nThey do have great Bleu Cheese dressing and the wraps and burgers are good. Its a good change from all the chain resturants in the area. \nThe food is also pricey for the area, not as bad as it gets but not too cheap.\nAnother thing I don't like is walking through the smoking area to get to a non-smoking table.	2
It should be called the dessert buffet.\n\nI loved the chocolate covered strawberries, cotton candy, ice cream, frozen yogurt, fruit tarts, cakes, etc etc.\n\nSweet Tooth be the death of me.  Everything else was standard.  \nPrice $22 per person. \n\nSpecial Shout out to the wait staff, especially the guy from El Salvador!	2
Unlike it's line, I'm going to keep this short.  Tasty but small, expensive and slow.  Maybe worth going back every now-n-then for a date night dessert but no more frequent than that.	2
Food was okay. Had the Aloha Bento.  The beef was tough.  Chicken and fish were good.	2
Slow service and didn't give my kids any sauce for their nuggets even though we asked for some. They were not very friendly either	2
Fairly authentic Chinese noodle shop inside the Venetian. Very casual and not terribly crowded when we showed up for lunch on a Friday. Seated quickly and ordered and the food was out before we knew it. Based on what I observed, food can be a bit hit or miss depending on what you like and order. For instance the Shanghai noodles I ordered had a piddly amount of shredded pork in it but plenty of noodles. Meanwhile others at my table had ordered a bbq plate, kung pao chicken and shrimp noodles and all had quite a bit more meat in it. Service was pretty good and did I mention quick?	2
We decided to have Korean, got a great deal from groupon. We ordered the seafood noodle soup it was spicy . It had mussels, octopus,  shrimp and  some vegetables It was good it came with all these side apps. like kimchi.  A bit hot for me \n\nI made sure I had plenty of water to drink.    This soup can be for served for 2 persons.  \n\nIt was not on the menu, luckily the customer next to us had that.  And recommend to us. There was so much more I want to try. We enjoyed everything  !	2
"Don't be fooled by the 1950's dancing \""girls\"" with bikinis on the tv, as some are girls and some are not. This makes for a fun drinking game, but also for some awkward moments. The parking lot is small, the location is a big questionable but inside is a tiki bar feel and affordable drinks. The music is a bit too loud here for my tastes."	2
The location is good, avenue is a few doors down making it easy to shop for Plus Sizes. \n There are many items and so much to choose from. The clearance section is pretty big. They accept coupons and the clerks are helpful. \n They can be pricey if its not on sale, if you are on a budget I'd hit avenue. If you want quality stay here. I just wish they carried bigger sizes than a 28 and more stretch knits.	2
Service was slow people here seemed very confused on what was going on they have boxes laying around the store it's 3 stars at best	2
What do you expect?  I wavered from my usual Club and had the Buffalo Chicken to.  Not bad.  Not great.\n\nI am glad they finally switched the kids meal bags.  We have way too many of them.\n\nThey added more seating outside.	2
Went here to grab a lil sushi and was a lil disappointed. The place is amazing inside. Very hip and chic. The ingredients were very fresh, but the presentation was what I would expect from my neighborhood sushi joint and flavors did not excite like I would have expected. That being said, we did not really explore the menu and would give them another shot.	2
"Had to drop a star for these guys.\n\nHave tried a handful of other \""non deep fried\"" dishes and they all just kinda leave us flat.\n\nThe Chow fun is still the best dish they make. We have been moving over to Chous and Chodang lately for Asian"	2
Used to visit here quite a lot but since then there have been several new hairdressers (Owners?) and they do not seem to offer the hot shave that I enjoyed so much when the turkish / armenian guy was still there. The girl hairdresser is well competent and very sweet if not a little patronising - as she offered me a sweety after being a 'good boy' when the haircut took place. You could tell it was done often as she had a big jar of the sugar treats! \nHowever I did have a very good haircut, but next time i'd like to leave a place without feeling like a 12 yer old :o)	2
Great atmosphere, and creative menu! 3.5/5\n\nI went there about a year ago for S's birthday. A big group of us were seated at the patio outside. The atmosphere was great. I like the menu a lot. I remember the food was good but not very spectacular (when considered the price tag...). I only have it a low 4 because of its service. We had poor service that day! I hope the situation has improved since then. I will check back and report out again!	2
Not bad ... Beautiful building, but confusing floor plan. Young crowd abounds. Beautiful silhouette on the exterior drive-up at night.	2
Trust me to go to a bagel store and get everything but a bagel. After a week of Vegas living, I wanted to get something healthy and got a fruit cup, a vita coconut water and a banana. Damage was $15. The lady at the counter gave me a good natured ribbing about my diet. It did take another week to detox from that trip though.	2
"I've been to this location 2 times. While their maple bacon donuts are VERY delicious, both times I have gone to get a Ham and Cheese Croissant. It's right there on their menu-\n(http://www.rainbowdonutscafe.com/croissants.html). Yet both times they didn't have any. So this time I asked \""Do you still make them\"", and her response was \""Every once in a while\"". WHAT!?\n\nNote to Rainbow: Don't put something on your menu that you don't regularly serve. \n\n\nI won't be heading back even though the maple bacon donuts are yummy."	2
"The food was very good, but would it kill them to put more than 2 tiny tomatoes on an entree plate, given the absence of salad or any other veggies?? Maybe I'm just an un-hipster, but I just don't get this trend in dining. \n\nWine was disappointing and very expensive - $75 for a mediocre bottle:(\n\nForgot to mention that our table had the distinct feeling that the waitstaff thought we were all in kindergarten. They spoke to us in a quasi-baby talk and pointed out each morsel of food on our plate while explaining what it was. Guess that is also considered \""hipster\"", but we just called it awkward."	2
This is for the casino only as we did not, nor have I ever stayed here:\n\nNo poker room (never have had one), cleaner than most of the casino's downtown and well maintained. We played blackjack here and won a bit so that was fun. This seems to be a place that caters to lots and lots of Hawaiian visitors who are big gamblers, so that can be fun to watch as well.\n\nNot sure what the rooms are like upstairs but I do know they don't do reservations on the interweb.	2
Walking into Atomic 7 can be overwhelming but the staff is helpful in making selections. Treats are made on the spot so you can customize for dietary needs. This is what brought me in. My mom is diabetic and desparately misses sweets. She's had a mean craving for a pina colada so they made her a tropical smoothie with Agave. It was good, but she missed the pineapple flavor this mainly tasted like coconut and banana. I had the Waffly Good ice cream. It was awfully good. Since it's made on site the waffle pieces remain supremely crisp.	2
Quick and friendly service, little to no wait time. Try the El Ni\u00f1o margarita, delicious!	2
So, I've given it a few more tries and there's no denying they make great espresso. They're also very friendly. The only thing holding me back from a higher rating is that I'm not a fan of live music in coffee shops. It's a bit intrusive and awkward, however, that's simply my opinion.	3
I like it here. It's a nice, open restaurant, clean bathrooms, and the food was cooked well and as I ordered. What else can you ask for in a fast food place?	3
Their drinks R always so good and make 'em fine and strong. The food always good mix of flavors and combinations I love how they aren't afraid of trying new flavors and so far they have make my palate happy and the ones of my friends too. So yes I liked and keep going for more!!!	3
Went to Vegas for a bachelor party. My co-worker (bachelor) and his friends have a ritual to goto Smith and Wollensky everytime someone gets married. We sat in a special room that looked inside the kitchen. The large floor to cieling glass that separated us and the kitchen made a very quiet dinner possible. I ordered the rib eye steak, medium rare, and it came out delightful. My only complaint would be that the steak had a little more fat than I wanted and not enough meat.	3
Ate here twice during our stay in Montreal.  Very busy place so I took that as a good sign.  Overall the soup was good but it was a bit confusing with the ordering and what types of meat were in each dish.  What my wife ordered looked very different than the picture on the menu.  I liked it as well as our usual Pho place in Toronto but not as well as our favorites in New York or San Francisco.  I would recommend it, not outstanding but quite good.	3
Food was excellent. Service was a bit sketchy, but they were super busy. I would certainly go back. The aji de pollo was amazing as was the ceviche.	3
Def a good scene to have in Vegas that offers locals a different option other than he strip or locals casino. Hipster vibe, good beer selection.	3
Good place to go after your shopping in princess street.Has a good selection of food on the menu to chose from.Its not to pricey either.The staff were polite.	3
This place is great. I've been here plenty of times since the first one opened in Vegas. I really enjoy the Yakisoba. I usually get a chicken Yakisoba with a side of spicy chicken. Really good food for a fair price.	3
The original BevMo in the valley, if memory serves me well here.  Selection is better than some of the other locations and service has never been a problem for me.  Convenient location not far off the I-10 on the north side of the road.	3
Love their chicken gyro, really messy to eat, but worth it. When you order the combo get the oregano fries, really good.  This appears to be a family run business with all the staff very friendly and efficient. You are always asked if you enjoyed the food; so far a resounding yes. And make sure you try the Taziki sauce, yum! Next time you're at Blakeney, give it a try.	3
We finally stopped in for Happy Hour and were impressed.  \n\nWe ordered the Big Ass Burger and the Green Chile Pork stew based on recommendations here and both were excellent.  Portions are huge - we ended up taking half of it home.\n\nExcellent drinks and very friendly professional service.  We also liked the warm and inviting atmosphere in the bar.  Great value too - we were out the door for thirty bucks.	3
I love Bomberos! It's a great place to meet with friends...the couches are cozy for conversation inside and there is a great patio out back complete with a a fireplace. I love that they focus on South American beers and wines. The food is great...the service...not so good. On one of my visits I was served wine in a glass with a big crack down the side. Not sure how the bartender or the server didn't notice that. But other than the service, I love this centrally located bar.	3
Awwww. What a cute little park! There is even a little pond...and a softball and football field. So quiet.	3
Went here on a friday night and had a awesome time with my friends .great eighties bands was playing and they were entertaining.  Will return	3
Freakin' expensive and worth it.  The wine stweard and bartender were very knowledgable and fun.	3
How is it that I have lived here for almost 20 years and this is the first time I have stopped into Byblos? They have been here - neighborhood local - for almost 30 years! The owner stopped by while we were enjoying a delicious dinner of moussaka, hummus, babaganouche, tomato soup, and the lamb special. Every bite was incredibly fresh and delicious. Don't skip out before having dessert - the tiramisu and honey pudding were incredible. Oh, and the Turkish Coffee - great flavoring with the cardamom. Stop in and say hello - they'll love you for it and your tummy will thank you.	3
Asia Tea House is super conveniently located- I'd come here all the time, even if the food wasn't good. The spring rolls and vegetarian tofu is always top notch. The veggies are cooked well and the portions are huge. I love trying all the different bubble teas here. \n\nThe only word of caution I have is that the General Tso's tofu here just flat out isn't General Tso's. It's honestly just watery nonsense, so if you're going for tofu, get the vegetarian tofu instead.	3
Pho is good here as it should be, hence the name. The broth had really good flavor and wasn't overly salty nor oily. The veggies that accompanied it was fresh and crisp. This place is extremely clean. I really like the disposable chopsticks and sauce cups at each table. Rice plates are okay - I prefer the place across for rice plates. \n\nVery good service. The owner was charming and pleasant. Price was a couple bucks more than the average pho joint but nothing outrageous.	3
The pollo fundido was very yummy. For this price point it exceeded my expectations.  Although exterior bathroom was inconvenient.	3
i came here because my car was getting worked on nearby and the staff recommended this place while they fixed my vehicle. the atmosphere was ok. the place could use a little update. you can tell its been there for awhile. i ordered the eggrolls and chicken fried rice. it was good and filling! i would come back here if im in the neighborhood again!	3
No matter how many times I go, I'll never get used to the ordering system. But the food is delicious (expensive, but it's one of the few places near me with healthy options). I love their Broccoli Cheese soup and the Greek Salad. Plus it's nice to take some time to sit down with a good book or NDS game and relax on my lunch break.	3
I disagree with the person who said that they employees here are incompetent kids. True, the person behind the counter is usually half my age but I have been in this place many times and found that even though they are young they are usually friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. \n\nThis is my favorite spot for ice cream in the area. I love Cold Stone and like it much better than all the frozen yogurt places with stupid names that have been popping up everywhere. Plus, even though they are a chain the headquarters are in Scottsdale so hopefully more of our dollars are staying in the state.	3
What a great little bar, this will be another Arcadia success story. However, I don't like having to leave my drink inside just to go for a smoke. A tiny patio in the back with a table or two for drinks would be fine.	3
I stopped and had lunch at chucks today, and they are very friendly and good ole meat and 2 with tea and free cup of soup.\nthey also open at 5:30 am so if you are on your way to work say at 6:30 you can swing by  and grab a breakfast  samich!	3
great ayce. orders come out really fast. the sushi can take some time though. one time we were done eating before the sushi came out. but their food is really good.	3
I can't think of any other place where you can buy a Dutch oven and a shotgun all in one place. No wait... I can... Canadian Tire. Except the guns are much better here;)	3
Very good quality food, made fresh to order and extremely affordable.    Rather small inside, but personal and laid back.    The garlic naan and mango lessi were extremely good, and we really enjoyed the Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Bangab Bharta (eggplant).    \n\nIn the corner of a strip mall, so it is a little hard to find, but definitely worth the effort for authentic food at great prices.	3
I totally forgot to Yelp these cool cats! I guess because it's not an actual food location, I just forgot.\n\nWhat can I say that hasn't already been said? The Slider Truck is pretty bomb. I've only been able to visit them once, but I'm a fan. I had three sliders and some sweet potato fries. For the sliders, I chose a Pep Pep, a Yaya, and a Captain's order. I don't know which is my favorite because they were all equally good. And of course, the sweet potato fries were off the hook.	3
My daughter and I went to this new location for a late breakfast. We both ordered the bacon & eggs with pancakes, mine were the halzenuts /Nutella and hers the red velvet one. I have to say, it was great. It hit the spot.  Couple things that bothered me was we did wait a while before the food arrives, and there was a slight smell in the room. The staff was really nice.	3
After passing by several times and hearing about the ice cream macrons I decided to go in today to try one with my daughter. Very nice, friendly service and the macarons were delicious!!! I will definitely be back to try their food and for more macaron ice cream sandwiches!	3
Its now at the Southpoint Casino. I got to eat here twice on a comp.\nOtherwise i would not justify the cost of $400 for two people that does not include tip.\n\nthe first time i went there i had lobster, its a very nice restaurant with great service. The lobster was huge must have been 5 pounds at least.\n the second time i went i had the Chateaubriand which was very good.\n\nI recommend Michaels only for very special occasions unless you have deep pockets. But its worth the experience	3
Great sushi in a great modern sushi bar.  Happy hour menu is great however the standard menu is expensive.	3
Although I'm sure better ramen can be found elsewhere, this is as good as any I've had in Pittsburgh or Philly. Service is always good, and extremely fast (they just spoon some soup out), and the soup is consistently savory and delicious. Always hits the spot.	3
This place is a great alternative to Todai on the strip.  If you have the ability to drive to the outlets, I would recommend this place because 1.  You dont have to fight the traffic on the strip 2. the food is just as good as Todai...maybe even a better selection of sushi 3.  You can shop before or after at the Outlets ( a perk for your female companion)	3
Reasonably priced burrito compared to Filibertos. \n\nGet the California burrito. Super tasty. Open all day.\n\nThe Cali Bureet is a carne asada based burrito with french fries in it. Super tasty and an excellent value.	3
"Family style atmosphere. Food was delicious. Owner talked to us and made suggestions based on our palate. He actually took the time to listen. Coolest thing I saw was when the couple at the other table had finished and were getting ready to discard half their food, he kind of took offense as he stated \""I hate to waste food\"" and  turned their remaining food into sandwiches and sides to take home at no additional charge. I thought that was very cool. This place is what small businesses should be all about. Great food. Will definitely return. Even gave us tips on where to get excellent Mediterranean groceries!"	3
Good service, good food.  Par with other Red Robin's we've been to!	3
"Obviously you have to be lucky and be at the laugh factory when there's someone funny there,  I've seen some really funny comedians here,  Gallagher put me to sleep,  basically a crabby old guy,  he ended with \"" this is my last joke \"" .\nI was happy I didn't have to listen to his stupid jokes anymore."	3
Small gelato for $3.99 the size of a baby scoop. A bit pricey but I just call it a casino, non-national-chain premium. I got the pistachio but also sampled the spicy chocolate (a little too spicy), mixed berry (tasted like the costco smoothie), and mint chip (super minty but a bit more spearmint than peppermint). Overall the gelato was flavorful with a smooth, creamy texture.\n\nAlso, the worker helping us was great. He offered as many samples as we needed (for a large group) and was very patient with the orders.	3
This is one of the best Irish pub/restaurants the valley has to offer. They also have live bands perform on occasion.\n\nI used to work very close to here and wandered in about once a week. The food is authentic, with fish and chips and dozens of other traditional Irish comfort-food dishes.\n\nThe bar is wonderful with seating for about 20. They offer plenty of expected Irish Beer and Whiskey selections. They have a small patio for us smokers too.\n\nService is friendly, though it can be a little slow when they are really busy (lunch, happy hour and weekends).	4
Can't believe I am giving 5 stars to a place no one ever wants to go to. The Audi Service Department is like the dentist, you know you need to go, but you worry about what they'll find. Al is by far the best Service Rep I have ever worked with. Always accommodating and no bullshit games. I know this Audi has been more challenging than my past Audi's, but with that said Al and the Audi service team have been straight forward and have taken care of all of my issues with complete ease.	4
Awesome! This place is so cute and they made balloons for the kids when they asked for one :)	4
Great pizza. Yes, it's busy, but it is a new location and there's a shortage of great pizza places near by. So glad they moved in.	4
Best ground beef enchiladas in the valley.  The red sauce is to die for and they are not affiliated with the chain Garcia's so no disgusting food drowning in oil here.  \n\nI have been coming here since the 90's and sometimes drive out of my way from Tempe to get their enchiladas.  \n\nThey also have another building on the same property that has a drive through serving the same food as the restaurant.	4
The pizza these guys make is fantastic. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere nice a chill. These guys are vegan friendly which is a plus.	4
Hidden Jewel in dtphx!  Perfect spot to grab a super tasty lunch or dinner before a Suns or Dbacks game.  This place is in the old Cartel spot.  It is cozy but comfortable and inviting.  Both times I have dined there the staff is super friendly.  The pizza is AMAZING.  I would rank local joints like this: \n1) Bianco's\n2) La Piazza Locale\n3) Federal Pizza\n4) The Parlor\n5) Cibo\n6) Pomo\nSo since Bianco's is ranked nationally this place is holding its own in a close 2nd.  \nCheck it out ASAP.	4
For the epic win. Great food. Chill server. Awesome music and $3 car bombs! Can't beat it!	4
Great service and great food. We came for breakfast today but had to leave due to an emergency before our food came out, they were more than happy to bag our stuff quickly so we could be in our way. I really love their lemonade, it is hard to find good lemonade sometimes. My wife loves their pecan pancakes. Only downfall, no military discount, and there tends to be more rude and closeted racist at this restaurant than most, I guess it has a lot to do with the name. Maybe I'll have better luck for lunch, I'm going to Mein Kampf Eatery, should work out great!	4
Excellent food\ni love Lamb Chops\nVery clean and lovely service\nFast delivery \nThank you Guys  keep going	4
One of the best places in Charlotte! The chicken and broccoli was very good! The chicken and shrimp fried rice was good as well. It says 2 people could share one item.....not so sure about that.	4
I bring my Chevy here to be serviced & they always do a great job.  Jon is my service advisor & he is honest & so helpful!  He's really a great guy & will take care of you.  I recommend him all the time!	4
I really love this store! My fiance and I go there every time we go in to las vegas. They have a very nice selection of yarn. I can't wait to go back.	4
"Seriously loved this place. (\""Love\"", actually, since I'm still here. Great food, gluten free options, very friendly. Hope they can make a go of it. The house salad had a wonderful variety of flavorful, fresh greens. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and the Penne Genovese were great."	4
My husband and I went here twice on our Vegas honeymoon we loved this deli so much! The manager was so personable and we chatted him up about football, food and being newlyweds! The food is phenomenal and literally made us come back the next evening before our Ron Show. If you are looking for a fun atmosphere, something a little different than a buffet, best deli food ever and great friendly staff this is a must check in!	4
You can sit for hours with your laptop, with a good book, or talking and meeting new friends as you enjoy your coffee or tea and listen to great music.	4
If your looking for something different and new try this place! I eat here once a month at least. The shrimp ceviche is bomb! Not to pricy for the food and a good spot to have some drinks too! It's not a Scottsdale spot so don't expect the world! Try it u won't be upset	4
Anne marie is the awesomest of the most awesome peeps at Timbers....woot. she is friendly and you can tell she enjoys her job.  Timbers is a place to go if you want to feel like you are going to a place where everyone knows you.  Food is great, its clean, and its a safe place.	4
With its clean modern lines, brushed stainless steel kitchen, multiple flat screens and skyscraping views of the other Palms towers and the City Center-transformed Strip, Palms Place offers some of the nicest one-bedroom suites in town. If you're looking to buy an in-resort off-Strip condo with ample closet space, give it a serious look.	4
The only Dog Park in the Metro Phoenix area with a beach front so your dog can play in the water. Lots of big dogs but the owners and their pets seem well socialized. To see some photos and my complete review visit http://www.dogparkriot.com	4
The best in family resturants!  Great diverse menu,  wonderful service, and game room for the kids.  I choose this place for a night out with or without kids.	4
Always great service and GREAT BREAD!!!! Staff is always friendly and offers generous sized samples. Monkey bread is amazing, and my new favorite is their white chocolate blueberry french bread! This place is my new weekly stop! Highly recommend stopping by and picking up a sample!	4
BOMB ASS WINGS!!!\n\nTheir menu is small, but everything is good. My favorite things to order are the Thai Style Wings, Ginger Fried Rice and Pad See Ew. I try to come here at least once a month. This is my favorite place to eat downtown.\n\nOn certain nights they have a dj spinning house in the outdoor part of the restaurant. \n\nI love that they take your order using an iPod/iPhone.	4
This is a fantastic library and a great spot in Phoenix. One of the few places in Phoenix that actually makes me feel like I'm in a city.  I love the building, the staff and the selection.  There is always something going on whether it be people watching either inside or in the parking lot, classes, book sales, etc.  I'm glad that I live so close to this library as I'm here almost weekly.	4
Everything I was hoping it would be!  Guy rocks!  Best breakfast in Vegas!  The burrito, the stuffed pancakes, the French toast and the famous loaded Bloody Mary's were all best in class.  Table service was first rate.  But how about some XXL t-shirts?  C'mon man!!!	4
I really don't know why some people have given this place such bad reviews. Picky eaters maybe? I have tried Chinese food in NY, NJ and most places in Charlotte and this is one of the top Chinese places in my book. Fast delivery, food is great. This is more of a takeout/delivery place so don't expect 5 star restaurant treatment when you go for dine in. You will get paper plates and plastic utensils. By the way, you have to order the general tsao's wings and they usually have a coupon online.	4
Newly remodeled very tastefully done, looks like more seating, partly blocked off the kitchen a good thing.  New menu with new items to pick from. Great food and friendly staff. This is not a tasteless 70s Olive Garden.	4
Best breakfast in town as far as I'm concerned! I try to get something different every time and have never been disappointed! Macadamia coconut pancakes.......	4
After walking around the Forum Shops because i came in town to see my parents for my birthday we showed up here. We didnt have a reservation and they seated us anyway without griping or bitching and moaning. What a experience it was. From the bread to the Teriyaki Chicken i had which was massive and not badly priced either. And both my parents had nice sized entrees too. Next time im back in Nevada i will have to make a reservation and enjoy the food and customer service again.	4
aloha:\ngreat place great coffee  aaa+++\nnice folks\nvery high speed wi fi and wire	4
This is the only place that I know of that has Only 8 product in AZ. If anyone knows of another place, please share ... because I drive from Pinnacle Peak area to get this yogurt. What other sweet treat can you eat that is so low in carbs, low calorie and therefore guilt free to indulge. Grasshopper is my favorite flavor but hit and miss when they have it. Second best is Peanut Butter which they always have.	4
Good Thai food here.  Had laarb kai, chili mint, and pad Thai.  All great dishes and made very well.  I'm a bit surprised that their main competition is across the street, lotus of siam.  Well, food here is definitely good and worth a stop.	4
Simply the best upscale-ish Japanese dining in LV. I'm always excited to have the Omekase here. \nI would even go as far as saying that Raku beats Donguri, one of my fave upscale-ish Japanese restaurants on Manhattan's Upper East Side.	4
I love the private rooms upstairs that make for an intimate and relaxing experience. I've come here with friends several times, and it's always been a great experience with friendly staff, great atmosphere and delicious tea.	4
THE best cheesesteaks, freshest buns, there is nothing bad here!!	4
I have always had good experiences here- the burgers, chicken sandwich, fries, and chili are good. The quality seems better than McDonalds.	4
Enjoyed my visit to V-Nails for mani and pedi.  The hot stone massage offered as part of the pedicure is very nice.  I do not have to travel as far for my bi-weekly session. Great technician.  Mindy is awesome!  and everyone in the shop that I have talked to is very friendly.  Nice place!	4
Thank you Pablo for the wonderful experience you provided to Emilio & I. We were both very pleased with the service. We'll be back!	4
So pleased with this place every time!\nAlways do great work, great massage when getting pedicure, and super friendly staff and management.\n\nWent in for a chip in my gel manicure to be fixed today (I'm a biter) and they fixed for free.\n\nMy favorite nail spa!!	4
The best Thai food I've ever tasted. Friendly attentive staff, service is top notch!	4

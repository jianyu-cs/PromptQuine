What the hell. I gave the guy $20 and the gas would only fill up to $19.89.\n\nIt's not about the 11 cents, but the principle of the matter. From my experience, most gas pumps stop before it gets to the full value, but you can always keep pumping until it gets there. This was not the case with this one. The trigger was loose and just wouldn't go anymore. That's kinda fucked up if you ask me.	0
Went for dinner with my brother and my mom. We are all disappointed. We rather have spend the money at Tagliani down the street. The place had no more than 8 tables of customers. So you expect you would have more attention from your server. NOPE. My brother noticed the portion of the food was extremely smaller, but the prices are the same. Everything was just OK tasting. \n\nI do not think I will be back...due to the service and quantity of food you get.	0
just went to shitsburgh for the kings pens game....we called about 8 cabs over 4 days....the SHORTEST wait was 45 minutes. A couple times, they never even showed up or called. While a couple of the cabbies we got were ok, others were either f'n nuts or no help at all. How can a town have a cab co. that doesn't do thier job. We actually had to get a ride home from one of the workers from Excuses on the south side to our hotel. Are you fucking kidding me???? WHY HAVE CABS??? I would give them a minus 890573295672579067 if I could....	0
Pho is great after a long night of partying and I was excited to having some but it was a disappointment. Actually the egg rolls weren't too bad & their coffee was good & strong. However, the basil leaves they gave us looked old! You really had to pick through them to even find some decent looking leaves. YUCK!\n\nOther things to know about this place... Open 24 hours but CASH ONLY.	0
The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning.	0
What the hell happened?  Went here again, exact same time of year, one of the same servers.... the place was dead and I see why!  The bar didn't have a bartender in the middle of the day, the service was horrible, the food was crap, even the girl at the cash register was rude.  Wow, what a decline.  Last year was so great, the place was rammed and times were good.  The worst turnaround I have ever seen.  How do you mess up a Denny's?  Wow.	0
Terrible spring training facility. Bad food, seats all the sun, no cup holders. Many better stadiums around greater Phoenix area. Employees are rude and make the experience uninviting.	0
Never, never again!!  First of all... The only reason why I came to this buffet was for convienence I was staying at Bally's and it was just one hotel over.  \n\nThe food, sucks!  I was there on a Saturday for their lunch brunch and the selections sucked!!  There was not one good thing to eat.  The food was disgusting.  \n\nOne positive thing... The dessert's were good.  \n\nDONT COME HERE.  TOTALLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!	0
wow. this is the worst place I ever order food from. 1st the food came cold, & when spoke to the manager Joey he said - WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST,  then he insulted me, & was as unprofessional as a manager could be. He thinks making excusing & insulting people is part of saying sorry. I would tell everybody do not order from this place, as long as this guy is in charge. He is a joke of a mamager.	0
SHUT DOWN as of 3/31/2014 by Southern Nevada Health District for having 46 outstanding demerits. I will most likely never eat there again.	0
I'm pretty sure the speaker is broken or the employees are just poor listeners because the past 3 times I've gone here (over a two year time frame), they've gotten my order completely wrong. Normally, I wouldn't be so cross about a wrong order, but I don't realize it till I get home.\n\nAlso, they have the weakest churros I've ever had. It's just dough and nothing else.	0
First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35	0
"""Cute place but what a rip off. $30 for a pedicure and my feet are still extremely dry and the \""""""""massage\"""""""" that cost extra I could've done myself. I will not be returning here..customer service was terrible and the lady that did the pedicure was extremely rude and acted like she was way better then anyone on the planet."""	0
Fish not fresh. Tuna frozen!  Ebi from same frozen shrimp I buy from 99 ranch market!  Sushi is bad. Service was really bad. Never going back!	0
Leaving work and noticed that my tire was flat with an arrowhead shaped piece of metal between the tread. Pulled it out and used the fix-a-flat since I don't have a spare. Pressure held after I aired it up and drove home. Next day removed the tire and took it to Mcfall's, I showed them where I removed the shard and you could see where the goop had come out when I inflated the tire. They said nothing was wrong with the tire and there was no puncture, maybe somebody let out the air! Took the tire to Discount Tire where they found the leak (right where I told them it would be) and patched it.	0
This place is terrible. The whole idea of the place is dumb; I'm not paying overpriced prices for bad service, bad jokes, and to be seated on a bench with other couples. I left before I ordered.	0
I used to like this place and went there every couple of weeks or so, but they've gone cheap and removed all their customer services now in an apparent effort to save money: You have to go to the counter to get a menu, then go to the counter to order, food comes on styrofoam plates, you have to clean up your own table.  \n\nThe food isn't any better and the service and experience is now much worse.  I'm definitely no longer a fan.  The food is good, but it's not not THAT good.  Heck, even Panda Express does better now!  Lost a customer with their cheapness.	0
Don't buy anything from Sabrina. She offered me a pre-made smoothies and she put it back to the fridge when I said No to her. Plus you expect unfriendly service. Attention to the Manager/Owner please check your camera. It happen around 9:45pm.	0
Pizza isn't SoO good as everyone say it is. Pizza took a long time, a bit too salty and it came out burnt =\\ I wouldn't go back to eat again. Nothing like the EAST Coast pizza.	0
Wackness defined. Twenty bucks for food that makes T.G.I.Friday's look like it deserves a Michelin star. Even for an airport this place is overpriced and not worth a stop. The service was decent, but that was the only redeeming quality whatsoever about this place. Avoid.	0
This doctor was extremely rude and did not listen to my problems. He spent more time explaining that he doesn't prescribe narcotics than he did explaining what might be wrong with me. (Note: I never even mentioned medicine to him other than what I already take)	0
Just go to St. Vinnie's on Willy Street. I've worked for this Goodwill, and they really don't do all that much good will compared with the awesome Vinnie's whose prices and selection are far better. I like my clothes sorted by size and not color too. Donate and shop at the far better option.	0
I was so excited to go to this place especially for their 40 cent wing night. What a let down!	0
The bread is the only thing delicious here. Service was poor,, Cesar Salad taste rotten!! Fettuccine chicken was bland!	0
Wish I could only give them 1 star.  We had a pretty large order delivered to us.  One of the girls found a roach in their food.  Not a little bitty thing a big freaking roach. After that no one ate their food.  If you have one roach you have thousands or roaches.  When we called them, they said well it was only a problem with one, we will bring you a new order... Yeah No, you will come and pick up all your food and refund us the money.  After arguing about that for a bit, they finally did just that.  Will never be eating their again!	0
Bad service and nothing special about it..\n\nCompared to other Sam Woo branch seriously, this branch doesn't really serve a good food.. \n\nNot a good value.. Don't waste your time and money here, especially if you're familiar with Sam Woo BBQ restaurants.	0
i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review.	0
The red velvet pancakes were spongy and had a sour  taste. The breakfast calzpne was mostly dough that was still raw. TERRIBLE!	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)	0

Absolutely horrible. The owner Sharon is miserable. Took my rescue dog here. All I wanted was a close shave, nails clipped and basically just cleaned up. Picked her up 3 hours later and she looked like she wasn't even cut! Her nails were still sharp, her undercarriage wasn't even cut and all her hair was uneven like the clip fell off. I called the owner and she had a horrible attitude. I wanted a refund of the ridiculous price they charged - 50 bucks! She said no way and hung up. I'm calling the BBB, this place was dirty as well.	0
If I could give ZERO stars I would. Went once, not great but I thought worth another try since its my neighborhood nail salon. Had an appt the second time they clearly should not have made my appt as they put me in a pedi bowl and I waited for over 40 minutes....constantly saying 5 more minutes. I finally took the liberty of taking my raisined feet out of the bowl and left. No apoligies-no towel-not a happy customer. DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH!!	0
Food was bland.  Service was slow.  Screwed up my bill - chased me down in the parking lot to get me to come back to pay more.	0
Absolutely the WORST club I have EVER been too. Service was horrible and they must be desperate for funds because the club was way over capacity. I love going out but I will not be returning here.	0
Don't shop here.  sych!	0
Sadly, I have to join the crowd on this one. I was hoping that Kitchen 56 would make my memories of Vatra go away, but instead just reminded me all over again. Food was WAY overpriced and just OK. Kudos to Eddie the Server who brought with him the only charm available the second time we tried K56; I'd give him 4 stars if the review were based solely on his service & personality. I will say the interior is much better than the previous incarnation, but the spots (lights) at the counter-height 4 top shone in my eyes and made me feel like it was last call...and I don't drink.	0
Rip off they suck !! My nails aren't even the right shape some are bigger then the other don't let the fool you if you ask for your nails a little narrow but still square at the end they'll tell you it's 5 DALLORS more ?? FOR WHAT ITS STILL SQUARE I JUST WANTED IT NOT SO WIDE .. They suck you'll find cheaper and way better	0
Worst bar I've ever been to. I was here for a bachelorette party and I think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer. The bartenders are rude, the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude. Also,  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there. No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet. Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage.	0
I gave it 0 Star. Arrived at 5pm and got seated but no menus were given. At 5:10pm asked for menus. Ordered food at 5:20pm. Got my 2 Thai Iced teas at 5:23pm, nice service is picking up! At 5:45pm asked why food hasn't arrived yet and was told that they are backed up and seeing the table behind us which ordered 10 minutes after us getting their order. Walked out at 5:55pm and still no food. Sad place for restaurant, could not even get a Shrimp Fried Rice in 35 minutes.....	0
The food was awful. My mushroom ravioli was rubbery and so unappetizing looking they should have been ashamed to let it out of the kitchen. My daughters chicken was so overcooked she could not cut it. The waiter told us we should have sent it back but he did not come back to check on us. Will never go back to this location again. Stay away there are a lot of other restaurants nearby try one of those	1
Food was overpriced and not memorable. I did not have a bad experience, but I have no desire to come back again - even though I was staying in the hotel adjacent to the restaurant.The atmosphere and decor are a bit swanky and inviting, so a nice place to stop in for a quick drink.  I didn't like the red wine selection at all - no robust varieties.	1
Good Club, but 1 Major unexcuseable problem for me...\n\nI have to wait in a line to go into the MENS restrooms????	1
They finally closed. I believe this was the first A.J.'s in Arizona......and the past few years it slowly went downhill.	1
I've come in here during my previous business trips and gotten great food. \nI have specific food allergies which they were able to previously accommodate, however not this time.\nI called in my order as usual, but they told me they changed their menu and what I wanted was a lunch menu item. The menu online hadn't been updated yet they still told me they wouldn't give me the food I was trying to order. \nThis to me is false advertising, and poor customer service. \nDont get me wrong, the food I had was good, but now I wont be going back because of this.	1
I have been here many times but the place seamed different this time.  The veggi portions were tiny.  The meat seemed tough and the waitres was less than accomedating.  I think I will have to find a new place in town......what a shame.	1
First, the good:  Our appetizer that was an artichoke cheese dip was fantastic.  The french onion soup was really good.  My side dish that was the blue cheese au gratin potatoes was my favorite of everything.  Lastly, our waiter was incredibly attentive.\n\nNow, the bad:  Our steaks were horrendous.  I realize some fat on the cut of meat is necessary...but so much that it was difficult to chew on any piece of meat stinks.  Unfortunately since it is a steakhouse, the main dish was what we looked forward to.  \n\nWill not be returning with so many other steakhouse options.	1
Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow	1
Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE.	1
Had my nails done for my wedding. VERY overpriced and quality not the greatest either. Just went because we were staying at the Monte Carlo. Would not go back.	1
I don't get it. I ordered the chicken and waffles like everyone recommended but it was very tasteless and over cooked. Maybe I'll try it again. Just don't see it though. It was large enough for 2 people however. Maybe 3 since non of us cared for it.	1
The staff is friendly, it's all downhill from there.\n\nRoom 1122 don't book this room if you need to sleep, between the train, the ice machine and the AC/heat wall unit no sleep.\n\nPeeling wallpaper in the common areas, outdated.decor.\n\nFood was cold at lunch.\n\nNo outlets available to charge anything.	1
Love Nurse Purtee. Hate that im always waiting over an hour past my appointment time even when im 20 minutes early. Also hate that I have to schedule immunizations over 6 weeks in advance.	1
"""Rooms small (apart from one or two fantastic suites). All a bit tired now.\nFull of american coach parties.\nOh.. and they play \""""""""highland music\"""""""" over breakfast.  I think that says everything that needs to be said."""	1
The novelty has worn off....too many locations....too meh of flavors.... Portions still huge, but paying $14 for a giant pancake, eggs and some bacon is pretty deceiving.... Service ok for a weekday.....  Im still trying to figure out WHY go in the Plaza.... I mean friggin urine stained plaza...... wow....somebody got paid big bucks....\n\nanyhow....its always worth trying once.....Definitely need a menu upgrade....	1
No where close to chipotle. Threw half my veggie Burrito away. Perhaps meat stuff or salads are better. Not going back for sure.	1
Steak was not cooked to order.  Server acted like she did not care.  Appetizer to share was small and not that good. Side Mac and cheese was great.	1
We ate at this place for Thanksgiving dinner, and it gave me an overwhelming feeling of OK-ness.  The selection of dishes is very limited and not too exciting.  The food is passable.  The service is actually pretty bad - they have food runners who never know which person or even which table the food goes to and waiters that are experts at zooming past you avoiding eye contact.  The decor is cheesy.  Skip.	1
Brunch was the goal. I'm not really sure what I left with. I was full, but I would hardly call anything they had on the menu as brunch. The food was average. The prices were a little on the high side. I did have an incredible coffee!\n\nHere's the problem in having a bathroom in the middle of the dinning room... when one coffee drinking patron went in for evacuation everyone HAD to smell it. Ouuffff.... Luckily I had paid but was on my way out. Not cool.	1
It was just ok. The waitress was really nice but forgot my fries. Not tragic, as another waiter brought me some, but they were cold and rubbery. The waitress also forgot my second order of fries, too. No fries for me. Whiskey River Chicken Burger was OK but it wasn't hot, just luke warm. It's a beautiful and lovely restaurant... on the Downtown Summerlin Mall complex but eh food and service. =/. This isn't the typical, great RR experience but they just opened. I'll try again at a later time. =)	1
Sat at the bar for a quick glass of wine and to order some food to go. I ordered A glass of red wine. It was good, i don't know if it was worth 9$ a glass though. The bartender seemed a little mad I wanted half spinach, half romain on my Cesar salad. I'm picky, but I am nice about it. We ordered the spinach pear Gorgonzola pizza. It came out cold, and wasn't that amazing. Probably wouldn't come back.	1
Ehh this buffet isn't really good! Ive have had worse though. Salad bar, prime rib and the peel and eat shrimp we're good. Everything else was mediocre. Not a huge selection of items also but for $15 for dinner I guess I can't complain. I probably won't be back for dinner again but I like to try there breakfast buffet.	1
"""Sadly disappointed\n\nNot sure if it was an \""""""""off\"""""""" night for this 4 star yelped restaurant but I was quite surprised.  Someone needs to tackle quality control.\n\nNothing seemed fresh, the food looked as though it was presented well, but tasted like stale leftovers (I hate leftovers).  ALL the cut  meats were completely dried out and tough (yes.. Ribs, prime rib, turkey.. Dry and tough).  The Asian cuisine made me sick.. Seriously the only things worth eating 1) pizza was editable, and 2) the ice cream was yum.\n\nI will not be returning!"""	1
Fresh 52 is ok, barely. The corn man had the best deal at 5 buds for $3. But I'm not a big corn fan. I wanted some strawberries or apricots. Maybe some spinach or green beans. Some kale perhaps. Maybe some apples. But I'm not paying $5 for a pound of strawberries when I can get 2 for $5 at Sprouts. $4 for a pound of green beans. Yea... I'm getting in my car right now & going to my nearest Sprouts.	1
Definitely not worth a second trip. Dirty and bad service. The bread was great, but that was it. The salads looked wilted and were overdressed. The pasta was nothing to rave about - actually a bit overcooked. And was served way to fast - not even half way through our salads. So probably ended up under a heat lamp. Certainly would not recommend to anyone. 2 stars for the bread.	1
Very average pizza!  Very over priced based on the cost.  Asked for a side of sauce to add to my pizza, had to pay for the side, was tiny and when I asked about it the response was its our policy.  Hate to say it was a waste of time!	1
JULY 27 2012 people go around in carts or u can order from the menu. The decor is ok. Overall this place is alright the food is not really that great. I would plan not to go to this restaraunt	1
have tried the food here a few times (old location and current) and am just not impressed and it's clear that they have lot of Brookline locals doing their p.r. / promotions for them. People that don't get out of the yinzery confines of Brookline much, i'm guessing.  I see a couple praising reviews of it and I wish I could agree and wish i'd had whatever food they did but , shrug, just another old school / old-boy Pittsburgh Italian-ish eatery. (real Italian is better .)	1
I stayed here in the early days when it was a Hilton. It was a great hotel! I then stayed here a month or two before the hotel changed hands. It sucked! Given a good room deal, I thought I would give it one more go -- about a year later. Still sucks. \n\nCareful - they give out a coupon book to use throughout the hotel. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE SMALL FINE PRINT ON THE BACK OF EACH COUPON!!!	1
I hate to say it, but I'm not a fan of BOA's lunch.  I was so looking forward to a great lunch experience, since it is a very popular restaurant among the stars.  Unfortunately the food was dry, bland, and boring, much like this review.  Will I eat here again?--maybe.  I'll give dinner a try and update this review in about six months.	1
Bland food poor service,overpriced. Goes to show if you get on a tv show people will come. I was one of the fools  a few years they will all be gone	1
First time we came it was a great experience overall on regards to great food and good service. \n\nThe second time I went there was a drastic change. Service was slow, lazy and it felt as if they just didn't care. We were checked up on only when I had to look around and even then they were reluctant to help. I hope the service gets better.\n\nIf you do go, do so during the evening hours because the service is much better.	1
Sushi is ok but rolls are small and service is really slow.  I ordered 3 rolls, it took 20 minutes to get the first one, and they served them one at a time. It wasn't crowded, I was the only one at the sushi bar.   Go to Ginbu 401 instead.	1
"""One of my 'Must Do's for Vegas was the buffet. A cab driver suggested the one at Caesars as many of the others have \""""""""gone downhill.\"""""""" Words cannot explain my disappointment. The buffet is extremely small and lacking selection. As a matter of fact, one of the local casinos in my home town is about 3 times larger and 100% better for the same price. For the buffet to be that of such a grand hotel and in a grand location, I was dumb-founded at it's mediocrity."""	1
Service by casey not so good food was excellent	1
The espresso is very good. But I won't be back. Why? The guy who made my espresso couldn't be any more obnoxious. \n\nGeez. First he tells me I'm standing to far from the counter and that I have to stand closer if I want to order. Ok, I take a step forward. Apparently, I wasn't in the right place. I had to take three steps to where the line begins. Stupid me for thinking I could cut in front of... Nobody.	1
Overall a very blah place. The atmosphere is clean and positive, but the staff are not super friendly. The prices are competitive, but not the greatest. My manicure has a lot of air bubbles!! It does not look good. There is a very limited selection of colors as well. I am new in town and trying new places and I will not come here again.	1
"""Not for everyone. Although I think kids would have a decent time here, for 2 adults looking for something to do, Rawhide doesn't have much to offer. We paid $5 for parking and spent about 30 minutes walking through the \""""""""town\"""""""" and took a few pictures. But we really could have gone without. I wouldn't recommend putting this on your to do list for the area but if you're really into the western theme, I suppose you'll find town interesting."""	1
"""High marks for the tasty pizza, but beware the build your own option!  We ordered a 14\"""""""" thin crust with chicken, roasted red bell pepper, mushrooms, and feta, and the bill came out to $27.50!  I ordered from their online menu, which did not list the price of these ingredients. If I knew it would be that expensive, I would not have ordered it. I spoke with the manager who apologized for those prices not being listed on website, but stopped short of doing anything to make it right, apparently unconcerned about losing a 17 year customer. We like their pizza but there are other excellent, less pricy options we'll choose next time."""	1
Positively the snobbiest Starbucks I've ever been to. Get over yourselves and crack a smile, for goodness sake!	1
The scene on Columbus weekend was relaxed and uneventful.  We did enjoy hanging out in the lounges watching TV and playing PlayStation 3 in between laying out and hitting the hot tub.	2
"""Alto E gets an \""""""""A\"""""""" for ambiance and service.  Alto E is situated in the Scottsdale Hyatt - beautiful venue.  The service was impeccable, the staff were attentive and friendly.\n\nWhere Alto E fails short, the food.  I was looking forward to a great meal and left disappointed.  We had the crab linguine and it was unbelievable salty.  We also had the duck confit and while the dish was decent, there was nothing spectacular about it.\n\nThe highlight of the night was the gondola ride, it came complimentary with our dinner.  Major brownie points if you're trying to impress your date."""	2
overpriced california/italian food.  Small portions.  Lunch service is slow.  Don't expect to be out of there in an hour.  Patio in the summer is a good place for a leisurely $20 lunch.   Decent place to take a visitor if you on an expense account.	2
Good place for lunchtime burritos. good service and nice atmosphere.	2
Not a huge fan of this Target.  It's the closest one so I find myself going there but the store is so large and it feels like everyone inside is an ASU student at times.  Which basically means it is always crowded with people and I find myself waiting in line to check out.  Otherwise, it's has a lot of good things.  Lots of parking, great staff and like I said before it's super sized so you can find anything and everything you need in one location.	2
This was my 1st time here. It was very busy! I ate a savory, Dutch pancake for lunch, which was just ok. It didn't have much eggplant on it. It was mostly just squash.\n\nI liked the atmosphere / ambience and music, but the servers were not too friendly. No one asked me if Iwas enjoying my food. But overall, it's a hip spot.	2
The barista was really clumsy and had dirty dishes across the whole working station. I ordered the Green Tea Latte and it tasted... weird.\n\nThe tables are also very dirty, empty cups and plates everywhere. During rainy days, you can expect lots of homeless people there as well.\n\nSeatings were very limited and the place was really LOUD.	2
Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere	2
Am I the only person who does not want to drink coffee or tea out of a mason jar?  Also, it is a coffee shop......in a bar.......and they would not serve me a glass of wine before noon (and it was NOT Sunday).	2
Not as good as Molly Brannigan's, but a decent pub none the less.	2
Shawarma, pita and garlic sauce can not go wrong with some vegeatables.  Their hummus is alright, and service depends on who you get, some the friendliest in the world others seem to hate their job.  Stick with the Shawarma and it is a no fail.	2
This is my first sushi experience in Arizona and it was good, but nothing spectacular. The food is good, the service is decent and they would've gotten four stars, except the music that plays is SO annoying that it ruins the atmosphere of the place. Ambience is pleasing to the eye, but horrible on the ears.	2
When it comes to Pancakes, I'm a simple guy.  Give me some traditional Buttermilk Pancakes and I'll be a happy camper.  That's what I get 99% of the time I come to IHOP.  This location is in the middle of Summerlin, next the the gym I work out at.\n\nIt's one of the nicer locations in town as they've kept it clean and comfortable.  The employees here are always friendly and I've never had any issues with the service.  It gets really busy on the weekend, so I normally come here with the family on a weekday morning.\n\nWill I return?  You bet.	2
It's ok, it needs more fresh produce somewhere in the market. there are nice vendors there, but it needs more market types.	2
"""A great spot to grab breakfast... very crowded on a Sunday, despite the throngs of people, the staff was still very upbeat and nice... had to get the Uncle Hershel's favorite so I could cover all the important \""""""""bad for you\"""""""" breakfast items: grits, biscuits and gravy!  Once we were seated, it was still very crowded - but our server did an excellent job!  My coffee and water were never lower than half and she was very attentive and pleasant.  A solid restaurant, run by friendly people!"""	2
Their pizza may be great, and the service here is better than their Rainbow location, but their wings suck. \n\nGood price for 10 wings at $8, available in medium or hot. Except they're dry- both in terms of the sauce, and the meat itself. Also a downside: they only offer packets of ranch for dipping. Unable to tell if wings were made fresh, just know that I was disappointed with the quality of what I received.\n\nPizza slices are fine here, and their rice balls are a treat. Small tables for dining outside, inside dining available further back in the building. Steer clear of the non-pizza options and you're good.	2
Do not come here late at night as the wait is ridiculous! You can't blame them though as everyone is hungry and everyone wants to eat cheaply. With the exception of McDonalds, this is about as cheap as you are going to eat late at night unless you go off strip to a late night buffet or one of those $6.95 late night meals. All in all, the hot dogs and fries are great as well as the philly cheesesteak. They do make everything to order so you know you are getting fresh food. The prices are not that bad but again, it is in a hotel in Vegas. What more can you expect?	2
Large airport... it's international after all, but my god it's a lot of walking. Needs more moving sidewalks ala Bellagio / Caesars / Luxor / MGM style. lol. \n\ncould also use a facelift, it's rather lackluster in appearance, inside and out. this IS Vegas, right??	2
"""I like to call this \""""""""My Basha's\"""""""".    On the positive side, the selection of wine and beers is pretty extensive, the produce is fresh with quite a few organic choices.  The natural foods section has a number of pleasant surprises and they've added some new bulk dispensers there as well.  I've had mixed experiences getting help in the meat section but the checkout up front is always quick, much faster than some of the other grocery store chains out there."""	2
They have a nice assortment of music on the weekend.  The drink menu is comprehensive, we were happy with what was offered. Spacious and we were comfortably seated - much nicer than so many other bars around town.  \nIt reminded us of a cruise ship.	2
Buyer beware they have raised the prices here again!!!!!	2
Trevi is located in the middle of The Forum Shops in Caesars right next to the large fountain and statues. The atmosphere is great and includes enjoyable people watching, but the food did not live up to the ambiance. \n\nCrab meat, Spinach and Artichoke Dip (3) - Never saw or tasted any crab, so really you're just charging me 15 bucks for an average spinach and artichoke dip.\nChicken Marinato Pizza (3) - Decent brick oven pizza, nothing overly fantastic that jumped out and grabbed me. \n\nService was OK and prices were Las Vegas-esque (overpriced).	2
I've been coming here my whole life. The zaru soba is good. The sushi used to be better. But I'll keep coming here because I have a place in heart for it.	2
I don't live in Champaign anymore, but I did spend a few years there, and those years may have colored my feelings about Mas Amigos in comparison to its competition.\n\nOn its own merit, Mas Amigos is a no nonsense kind of place which provides very fresh chips and salsa and the food is decent. \n\nHowever, given the choice to go to any Mexican restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area, and having tried Mas Amigos out, I think that I would still head over to El Toro or Dos Reales.  Old habits die hard.	2
The good: great flavors- the pork is delicious, different options, clean and friendly team\n\nThe bad: this is my first time here so my biggest concern was the temperature of the food. I came for a late lunch, I get it, but didn't feel like the items were super fresh or hot. I think this would have been different should I have come during lunch or dinner hour. My other suggestion: the sauces should've served warm, not cold.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it and would try it again. Love the concept.	2
We have friends who rave about mu shu. We like it, but not enough to make it regular, and we live just a few blocks away. Price/value is measured in pounds. Friendly service, still it's cafeteria quality	2
Chimichangas are very good and filling....couldn't finish it. The salsa was decent and slightly spicy.  Had a peach Margarita...very yummy and strong.	2
3.5 stars\n\nStopped by while hopping around Old Town. The music was on point and most of the dancers were great. The crowd was mid-twenties but weren't really dressed up. People were spread out on the outdoor patio are and the inside. It was fun stopping by and was one of the better spots we stopped by in Old Town.	2
Do not, I repeat, do NOT go to the nail salon next to Dillard's. Very horrible service, they do not listen to you, they do a horrible polish job and of course the typical Vietnamese gossip the whole time which is very annoying.	2
Cool concept, slight miss on execution. Half the booths are closed on Sunday. No designated parking just for the market, we got turned away across the street by the church organization. Parking garage closest to it charges $2 per 20 minutes.	2
Should be 3 $. 10oz filet $48. Presentation looked good, sauce on the ribs and chicken was a little thick, salads were very good and so was the bread.	2
Pretty good selection, they don't sell hotdogs here and make sure you check the date on some of the beer.	2
I used to go here a lot... But then the staff changed and the bartenders just suck now. I still like the waitresses. Its a shame they have to deal wit slow bartenders now.	2
Our south tower room had great view of the Strip and casino isn't so large that you get lost. Room was a bit tired and there are newer, cheaper options. Not bad.	2
This is a great Chili's location. yhe highest rating I could give any chili's is a three and they get it. Hostesses, waitstaff and manager were extraordinarily committed to making sure they understood what we wanted and that it was perfectly executed. It's worthy of recognition, so I wanted to share it. A very well-run place!	2
The food is good....selection is ok.  The service is good. It is WAY loud ALL of the time.  I understand that it is more of a sprots bar kinda feel but not being able to hear the waitress was a little frustrating/\nWe will go back I am sure of it.	2
New location, lines at the drive-thru wrapped around the building, but moved fairly quickly.  The staff was courteous and efficient.  Ordered the shrimp po-boy, which was cold, but the onion rings were hot and delish!  This is a chicken place so maybe that's what I should have ordered.\n\nNot bad for fast food!	2
Excellent food. Warmly lit low light ambiance and good background music. Unfriendly hostess, but waitstaff was on point. Felt decadent to be there and we'll try it again.	2
Whisky selection is limited. But food is good. Crusted calamari is a delicious appetizer	2
I would just like to say that I actually feel this place should get 3 1/2 stars.  \n\nLove the burritos.  Not crazy about the salsa.  staff is super friendly and I love them.  Burritos are HUGE.  I love how they make them according to your likes in front of you.  A little bit over priced i think but not bad at all.\n\nI could probably go quite often and if I am in the area I do.	2
Craving a slice of NY pizza and you live in Vegas? I think we all agree, this place is IT!  Some may complain it's too far from the strip or from Summerlin. Trust me, it's worth the drive. Why didn't I give it a 5 star? Because, I've had NY pizza and nothing comes close to that. Go get yourself a slice.\n\nAnd if you don't care what your thighs will say after you've devoured a pint of creamy ice cream then head on over next door...(I don't remember the name). They have great lucious creamy ice cream. yum!	3
It's more 3.5 than 4 stars.\n\nYou're typical Asian Buffet. I'd say it's similar to Pacific in Chandler. The booths need to be re-upholstered in my opinion, but service is decent.\n\nThey have a mix of your normal greasy Chinese food options, a sushi bar selection with Sashimi and crab legs. \n\nIt's fairly cheap for a buffet.	3
Yum Yum Yum\n\nLove the decor and the music is fun to grooove too lol, The idea of these foods together makes a great diverse meal!\n\nMy deliciious meal:\n-The beef tenderloin and aji panca was great and it was perfectly spicy.. very juicy (not dry at all)\n-Peruvian corn :)\n-The Bobo Brazil samba roll w has seared kobe beef, avocado, kaiware, shiso, red onion, chimichurri -- FREAKIN BOMB	3
This place is absolutely Fantastic! the green sauce and the chicken compliment each other so well. i definitely recommend.\n\nThe service is also really good, if they know you are new they will explain everything to you, and make sure that you understand. This place is exactly like chipotle, just a little less corporate. This place is a must visit, even if it is just once!	3
"""Teakwoods \""""""""touch em all\"""""""" is the best burger ever! Terrific wings too."""	3
Heaven, I'm in heaven... Bacon	3
We went to Raceway Bar & Grill  it is kind of away from the town but it was a treat. Food and service great. Lots of collectables to see. Pizza was different but awesome.we would go back for sure. Rand the owner made the experience even better. Had an Amber beer which was great to.	3
Love it here. Classic Filipino cuisine. ok service average decor. Good star rating for its quality of food.	3
A healthy choice for lunch or dinner in the plaza! The dumplings are homemade and are very soft. I had the carrot + beef dumplings and they were quite delicious. The congee is fairly cheap at 2$ a bowl so whenever I have spare change, I stop by and grab one. Give the place a try!	3
Favorite spot for a quick sandwich.  Salads are fresh and healthy and sandwiches are the perfect comfort food.  Husband and I go twice a month.\n\n9 times out of 10 the employees are friendly and quick to help.  Once in a blue moon, the teenagers are a tiny bit cranky but that has never affected my meal! \n\nMust try- spinach salad and Gobbler sandwich.	3
"""\""""""""No Knife Needed\""""""""\n\nIf you're a fan of true southern cuisine make sure you check out Mamma's Boy Cafe.  I just enjoyed smothered pork chops, mac & cheese and greens. The chops were true to their name, not fried and dipped in gravy like some other \""""""""soul food\"""""""" establishments.  These chops were truly smothered in a killer gravy, seasoned to perfection and were so tender I only needed my fork to cut into them; reminded me of my grandmother's cooking.  Needles to say, I will be a regular and I'm looking forward to exploring their menu.  Kudos to the owner and his team!"""	3
My fav all time coffee destination in Tempe. It's a fabulous place to do homework and socialize.	3
We stopped here for brunch after a single night in Montreal. The food was excellent. My wife enjoyed the oysters, and I loved my Lobster Benedict. The service was great as well, but the kitchen was a bit slow for a restaurant that was nowhere near full. If we had been in any kind of a hurry, this could have been a problem.	3
Nice place that has a very family run feel to it. The concretes are awesome and are huge. Cost is ok for the size concrete you get but that brings me to my only complaint. I wish they offered the concretes in multiple sizes instead of just the pint size.\n\nAwesome dessert and especially after pizza next door at Grimaldi's.	3
If you go here what you need to do is get on that meatball sub game. The meatballs are enormous, the cheese is melty and tasty and the sauce is robust. I like this place because the portion sizes are huge, possibly even too much as i never feel good after eating here. Then the bazooki cookie will find its way on my table and that melted piece of heaven comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and its 5 bucks. This place is dangerous because put it in the books that your going to fall asleep after. Great food just dont make plans to go out afterwards.	3
Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.	3
The curious case of the disappearing review. I'm sure I've reviewed Fajita's before, but it seems to have vanished.\n\nFajita's has some spectacular lunch specials. I give them 5 full stars for their lunch, not so much for dinner (much more pricey), which some how I've determined equals out to 4 stars.\n\nSo, go there for lunch, munch on some tasty fajitas on the cheap. Being a vegetarian, I thoroughly enjoy the veggie fajitas for a mere $5. They make their own in house tortillas, which are unique and very good. They also include their tasty chips & salsa for every customer.\n\nAwesome lunch spot.	3
Good food. Good prices. Good looking wait staff. Hostess was really nice and really cute. Service is fantastic. I come back yes.	3
Ate here a month or so ago and totally forgot to review it... \n\nI was impressed. Sandwiches were very good. Lots of meat, produce was fresh, prices were fair and the owners(?) went out their way to make us feel welcome. \n\nI'll be back.	3
I'll never understand how they can be so patient at this dennys. I was not sober, the waiter asked me for my order three times before i responded, and STILL had a smile on her face. oh, did i mention it was at 6 in the morning? \nThe guy at the table behind us knocked out and was snoring over his food to boot. You don't expect great food at denny's. You expect denny's food. it's not any better here than at any other location and it's not any worse either. food came out quickly, and it hit the spot.	3
Bath and body works needs to take a lesson from this place. So many home made soaps you'll stay clean for 30 lifetimes. They also have your reflexology covered wih starter kits, oils, and oodles of goodies that'll make you smell and feel pretty. Only downfall is that it's a wee pricey, but if you do around you can find something more budget friendly.	3
I like to think I'm a good local, but I never knew of this place until the Travelzoo offer came. A wonderful brunch spot right in downtown Phoenix (inside Westin Hotel). The decor is lovely and the service is on point, but the menu is also quite interesting. My favorite part is that they brew Intelligentsia Coffee (a Chicago favorite). One criticism: if the menu states 'roasted red peppers' I do not expect yellow, which are not as tasty. Overall, great experience I will repeat.	3
Lived around the corner from this place for over a year. Long overdue for a visit!\n\nWe went for lunch and sat at the bar. Had a rootbeer float which was A+++++ yum! \n\nMy friend had the Italian Bee and LOVED it. Said it reminded him of the little mom and pop shops in Chi-Town and Beantown. \n\nI had the margherita pizza which had the softest and melt in your mouth slices of tomatoes EVAH!!! \n\nA good choice for a good, simple meal :)	3
Fast service.  Ordered extra crispy chicken.  The food was good as usual.  Will come back again.	3
"""Love this place. Watched basketball there last night with a group of people. Fun and relaxed atmosphere with just the right amount of \""""""""divy-ness\"""""""". We mostly drank but had a few apps. The chips and queso were great as well as the wings and shredded beef mini chimis. The waitresses/bartenders were super attentive. I couldn't believe how they were so on top of it with cleaning up plates and empty drinks and bringing us new ones. Probably one of my favorite places to go when I'm in town visiting. Will be back."""	3
Phenomenally clean and the staff is beyond helpful.  They pierced my tongue a few months ago, it wasn't cheap but I really would not go elsewhere to have big needles driven through my tongue!	3
Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient.	3
Happened upon this place while waiting to watch Zumanity @ the NYNY. I was actually pretty surprised by this place. It has a nice atmosphere and really decent prices for an in casino restaurant. The chips and salsa were perfect and the carnitas tacos I had were moist and juicy. Everything served hot and fresh with great ambiance. The beans were pretty tasty, and something most restaurants mess up. If your on this end of the strip its not a bad place to stop before heading to the club.	3
This was my first time eating an empanada.  I got the black bean and cheese and the Hawaiian. For desert, we got the Nutella and bananas (with ice cream and wipped cream of course). Delicious!! Oh, we also got the Papas Fritas. They are potato fries with house seasoning.  So so good! I highly recommend them. Can't wait to go back and try some more. I'm now an empanada fan!	3
One of my favorite malls. Lots of fun stores, restaurants and activities.\n\nI gave 4 stars merely because this mall is hard to shop at during the summer and some of the major department stores and retailers are located far from the mall itself, so you have to drive and re-park a few times to hit all of your favorite stores. Otherwise, it's great!	3
I went in here when I had some time to kill while a watch was being fixed, and really liked it.  The layout was a little tough to figure out at first - hard to know if a book would be in new releases, fiction, bestsellers, etc.  but the staff is very helpful.  They also have great cards, journals and other gifts.  I love that they have a big jigsaw puzzle on a table with chairs around it if you want to sit down and work on it while someone else is shopping.	3
OMG! Their cookies are delicious! I had the peanut butter cookie (awesome!), rice krispy treat (delicious!), ice cream sandwich (okay...), & the sugar cookie (pretty good...).\n\nThey do accept credit cards, but only on orders that are $5 or more.	3
In the mood for some Mexican food and we found this place. The wait staff was really nice and knowledgable about the menu. \n\nWe ordered drinks, then entr\u00e9es. I ordered the tres fajita and wife ordered Monterrey enchiladas. The food didn't take a long time and was really good when it arrived. The food tasted really fresh and was presented very well. \n\nI gave this place four stars because I hadn't tried everything just yet. I'm looking forward to going back. \n\nAdditionally, the menu was very reasonably priced. I would recommend Cantina Laredo to anyone who likes fresh Mexican food.	3
Fixed my iPhone 4 screen. First fix they did, the replacement screen was defective. It worked but looked washed out. Didn't charge me and called me to come back in when the new replacement screen arrived. Second fix worked. \n\nUnfortunately one of the associates broke my cell phone case because he attempted to remove it incorrectly rather than allow me to show him. They rectified the situation by taking the cost of replacement case off final cost of repair.\n\nOverall satisfied. Would use again.	3
Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc.	3
Even though I didn't really find anything here, the sales people were super nice. Unlike their sister store Ann Taylor Loft. They greeted me upon arrival and didn't give me attitude when I only bought two items. It's hard to shop in this store and try things on because it didn't feel like the AC was on. They usually have a good selection but this time around I didn't find that much. Oh well. Save it for the next trip to LV.	3
My first time here was last night and I was quite impressed! Half of the walls are white half are red (a nod to wine, no doubt) the lighting fixtures were lovely and the decor was cozy! \nTwo friends and I shared a bottle of wine, some chocolate fondue and quite a lot of laughs! Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable although it seemed as if she was the only one there. \nGreat time great wine great location! Will certainly be returning!	3
We got the spa suite, no complaints. I love the medium sized refrigerator, no microwave though.	3
This place is a great place to help your kids get started on just about instrument. I would recommend this studio for any budding music learners!	3
A step above The Street in Mesa but not as good as Bomb Boba and other places in West Phoenix. Still pretty good though and they have a lot of flavors and varieties of Boba.\n\nAlways get the Honeydew Slush~	3
I had an excellent experience with this company. They came out for a no pressure estimate and explained all of my options and the pricing. Then they were patient while I decided and even had them re-quote different styles for me. They under-promised and over-delivered, which is great. They estimated three weeks and my gate was installed in one.	4
Great Service and Friendly staff. In and out quickly. Will go back for additional services when my truck needs it.	4
I love this store. The customer service is on point and there is a feeling of friendship around everyone there. I remember my second time going into this store one of the guys who worked there remembered me and said it was nice to see me, my awkward personality didn't know how to respond but I was happy he remembered me. I wish I would of said thanks or something other than nothing. These guys rock. Also there's a try before you buy cabinet which is awesome. Keep it up guys.	4
Eric was a great waiter for our wine pairing with MyVegas.com. Explained our pairings well and went to get answers when we questioned him. He did a great job and the food was great too.   We had the linguine with clam sauce and brick chicken.	4
We've ordered cupcakes from Treehouse on two occassions.  We've had lemon blueberry, vanilla, chocolate, and churro.  All were wonderful.  The mini cupcakes are the perfect bite.  Highly recommend.	4
I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills	4
Line to get a ticket is long, but moves surprisingly fast. I like the method of different tickets for different needs. It expedites the process. Friday is really busy. They have a tv.	4
This was our favorite buttet on the Strip.  My favorite dish was the shrimp & grits.  How do they get their grits that smooth and flavorful?  I'm a southern girl and had never tasted grits like that!  The chocolate mousse mango dessert served in a little cup was the most amazing dessert I've ever eaten!   The atomosphere here is much more sophisticated than the other buffets we tried in Vegas.  It was relatively quiet and a great place to eat and catch up with old friends.	4
What an amazing facility. If you are ever in Pittsburgh the Cathedral of Learning is a must see. Walk in awe as you travel the different floors via the elevators. The views from some of the floors are unparalleled. The history and beauty of this treasure will definitely make your trip to the Pitt campus a special one. Be sure to also check out the Hines Chapel right next door.	4
The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant	4
This establishment should be at the top of your list!  Totally mellow lounge which is refreshing in the fast paced old town.   Food is absolutely incredible.  Quinn and Aaron have only one motive.... Make the customer happy.   I highly recommend you check it out for yourself whether its for a quick drink, dinner, date or nightlife.  You won't be disappointed!	4
I think I've found a new favorite restaurant! The food is very fresh and flavorful, atmosphere is quiet and clean, service is outstanding... the owner is so welcoming that it felt more like I was dining at his home than a restaurant! A1!	4
You HAVE to try off the wall yoga -- it's amazing!!! Especially if you are inflexible.  The straps off the wall totally help you stretch deeper into the poses and doing inversions on the wall is way too much fun!!! Outdoor yoga is also phenomenal!!! This is one of my favorite studios!!!	4
I love this bar, it's my favorite in Vegas. The vibe is laid back and the music is never too loud. I love the art on the walls, the fresh flower arrangements and the eclectic furniture. Christina and Pam have excellent taste and have made this bar a really special place to hang out. The cocktails are tasty and the staff is always friendly! Try the burning bush, it's smokey and delicious!	4
Amazing beef rib & baby back pork ribs!!! Super cute place & great prices...the outlaw burger was ok..not so great as i expected it to be..	4
Everything here is amazing. Their pizza is bomb, its not on the menu anymore but ask for the kale pizza its to dieee for. Their turkey lasagna is also my go to. Their flavored margerita's are also really good...... and i dont even like margaritas. that is all.	4
China Star is one of the best places to get authentic Szechuan cuisine in the entire city of Pittsburgh.  Great recipes, a broad menu, and consistent execution make China Star an outing that I always look forward to.  The Chengdu Chicken and Cumin Lamb are especially good.\n\nIf you want Americanized Chinese food (your egg rolls and your General Tso's chicken), this probably gets bumped down to 3 stars at best.  But if you want REAL Chinese food, I can't think of another option that comes close.	4
This place is the best nail salon when it comes to nail art.  Lilly is extremely talented and I highly recommend her. I drive from the other side of town to this place. I also had a great pedicure that came with paraffin wax.	4
We just had our wedding reception at le Cafe, and it was an EXCELLENT experience.  Sal Cavalcante was the manager on duty, and he made sure that our party was well taken care of.  The chef Adam, did an excellent job with the food, and Sal's team with the service..... Will definitely go back!	4
Jayd is amazing at what she does! I highly recommend her! I went in and asked for a dark tan, which is what I left with. The Customer Service is great. She makes you feel very comfortable from the time you go in until the minute you leave. I'm a spray tanning newbie so she told me everything I needed to know about how to get it to last. She was thorough and my tan looked fabulous, tan, and even. I'm a bit overdue for a spray tan now. I will definitely be booking another appointment with her soon.  I highly recommend this place.	4
We shared a stone crab appetizer; never had these before, they were okay.  We were told that these were frozen from last season, since the season starts in October.  We just didn't see the big deal with them.  \nThe highlight of my meal was the 2 lb. lobster, which they cracked for me.  It was the best ever, and my wife loved her halibut dish.  The spinach was terrific, also.  All in all, a very rewarding and pleasant experience.	4
The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!	4
Great place to shop, the bakery and coffee area is cheaper than a Starbucks and the pastries are much better. The outside patio is a nice place to read the paper in the morning.\n\nThe staff is top notch and cares about the customers compared to other markets in town. For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent, so is the salad bar, and deli selections.\n\nThere is no negative to shopping here, unless you are using it as your main supermarket, then things can get pricey.	4
Awesome salads and burgers.  Different from any other restaurant in the area!  Very friendly staff!	4
Love this place!! Great vibe with great food and the staff is on point. Def try the new melt they added to the menu when u go. It's 2 patties 3 slices of bread, American and Swiss cheese, grilled onions and cowbell sauce and it's amazing! Will be back for sure.	4
Wife and I were there about a month a go for our anniversary and let me tell you the food was great amazing service our waitress that day was Courtney and she was incredible nice really enjoy our time thanks for the great service we were there on 04 24 2014 thanks again for the great food and service	4
Not sure why there are all the haters. This place always amazes.  The chef is a great guy and the food is incredible.  We had our wedding here and just continue to return for the food and ambiance.  One of the best kept secrets in the Madison area.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  They offer an impressive wine list and will do any wine by the glass.  We get great service and food every time we come here.  The Lilliana's burger will stand tall against any gourmet burger, the smoked wings amazing and if you like spicy the Chicken Diablo........ One word...... Sriracha!	4
Thank you reviewers and thank you yelp!  Our AC unit stopped blowing cold air, even though it was running.  After reading the reviews, I called Black Mountain Air and spoke with Todd.  He was able to come over the same day and quickly diagnosed a problem with the control board.  An hour later, the AC was running smoothly again.  We had been concerned that whoever came out would tell us that we needed a whole new AC unit and were relieved that it was fixable.  He also reconnected a duct that had not been connected (and was cooling our attic instead of the house) and didn't charge us anything additional for that. We would absolutely use them again.	4
I've been coming to this Ramiro's since the late 90's. I have always had a great experience when it comes to the food, always so fresh tasing!! The staff is always friendly and smiling and their menudo on the weekends is definitely some of the best around. You can really taste the love and care that goes in to all of the food here.	4
I only had time for a beer and appetizer. Unfortunately for me i had tickets to criss angel(wish i had skipped the show and enjoyed a full dinner and a few more beers) i had a pint of aruba red and the buttermilk chicken sliders. Both went very well with eachother and look forward to having again some day. I really hope this chain makes its way over to the east coast.	4
Had the Bun Cha Ha Noi. It was so GOOD!!! Must have this when u are here. I will come back :)	4
Looks MUCH better inside than out.  Fast, delicious food at a great value.  Could have spent the day just enjoying the soup that came with the lunch special.	4
Love this gym. Always clean, never super crowded, awesome staff. Never had any problems here. If you want to talk to an awesome manager, ask for Kevin. Awesome dude.	4
I love this place! 1000 times better than Emilianos! The margaritas and food are both equally delicious. Affordable prices, great service, and a relaxing atmosphere make El Toro one of my favorite additions to the South Side.	4
i'm sooo glad we didn't have a lot time in here because my credit card would be moaning from all the abuse. adorable pin-up clothes, bathing suits, lingerie, shoes, and accessories line the racks and walls. the sales rack had lots of cute things freshly marked down, and the girls were very helpful and sweet.  guess i just have to hit Vegas again in January what a bummer...	4
We went here again after discovering this great restaurant last time we visited Sedona.  Not only does it have a great sunset view of the beautiful  Thunder mountain but it has fabulous food.  The wait staff is very friendly & professional too.  Both the rack of lamb that I had and the scallops that my husband had were delicious.  The portions are generous and the meals come with soup or salad, hot bread, vegetable and rice or potato. It's a must try when visiting Sedona.	4
My girlfriend and I wanted to learn how to sew and stumbled upon Donna online. She is a great instructor and also very fun and flexible. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with her and learned everything there is to know about sewing! She even went to the store with us and helped us pick out our machines, tools, and supplies!	4
My favorite movie theater. Why? It's clean, the refreshment lines are short, many nearby dining & drinking options (and not just a Sbarro's or Chile's), covered parking (underground), it's a relatively safe neighborhood, and it's not tucked in a shopping mall. Add another plus - customer service. Last night we lingered at Morton's so long that we missed our 7PM show for which we prepurchased tickets. No problem they said, and handed us tickets for the 8PM. Very cool.	4
I recently got into doing triathlons. Finding a good tri store I thought would be hard, but the staff at tribe has been helpful every time I come in. They are loaded with all the workout goodies, which I love... Though my wallet may not.\nIf you are looking for any gear for swim, bike, or run this is a good spot!	4
Very entertaining!	4
